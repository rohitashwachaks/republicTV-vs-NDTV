NTAGI chairman NK Arora explains https://t.co/Sh1fnwavDs",https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/why-did-kerala-have-a-backlog-of-7000-covid-19-deaths-ntagi-chairman-nk-arora-explains.html,3.0,6.0,"Why Did Kerala Have A Backlog Of 7,000 COVID-19 deaths? NTAGI Chairman NK Arora Explains","In a recent update to the COVID-19 situation in Kerala, the CPM-led Kerala government on Saturday, October 9, admitted on the floor of the state assembly of underreporting over 7,000 virus-related deaths in the total tally. The Chairperson of the National Immunisation Technical Advisory Group (NTAGI), Dr NK Arora, highlighting the reason for 'under-reporting' of COVID deaths, explains the process of uploading the data to the national portal.   He said that Kerala is not the only state where the backlog of deaths was reported but there are many states that have been late in updating the information. According to National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), there is great difficulty in getting accurate information on hospitalisation which is very important as it helps to understand the health system leads. However, most of the states have incomplete data concerned with hospitalisation. He further urged NCDC to work with the state to resolve the issue.  Further applauding the Kerala government's efforts in management of COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, Dr NK Arora said, ""The state had controlled the Coronavirus infections very well last year while a surge in the cases was reported from past 2-3 months"".  He said that COVID cases will decline in Kerala as it has a good history with vaccine administration and vaccinated people will be less prone to infections.  The CPM-led Kerala government on Saturday, October 9, admitted on the floor of the state assembly of underreporting over 7,000 virus-related deaths in the total tally. Kerala Health Minister Veena George informed the Assembly that of the total COVID death tally over 7,000 deaths were found to be not included. She claimed that the misinformation of the data was observed due to technical lapses like missing out on patients' details and wasn't an intentional act of the government to exclude deaths from the list. In the last assembly session, George affirmed that the department would publish the updated list in three days. To date, Kerala has reported a total of 47.8 COVID-19 cases with 26,173 deaths. As of October 11, out of 18,132 new COVID-19 cases and 193 deaths reported in India, Kerala recorded 10,691 cases and 85 deaths. The state has administered a total of 3,66,56,548 COVID vaccine doses across 1,273 vaccination sites. (Image: ANI/PTI/REPRESENTATIVEIMAGE)"

Suresh, also known as 'DaVinci,' spent nearly 15 hours creating the massive 24-foot long art installation. The art installation was created in the hall of a Kannur bakery using numerous tables arranged in the centre of the room. The face of Theyyam was created using up to 25,000 biscuits of various colours and sizes, as well as other bakery products. Suresh was invited to make the art piece in Chef Muhammad Rashid's bakery, 'Bake Story.' ""We have invited DaVinci Suresh, who made the artwork of North Malabar's traditional art form Theyyam using bakery items. Bake Story bakery from Kannur also became part of DaVinci Suresh's 100 medium plan,"" remarked the chef. After that, all of the bakery products were given to a veterinary farm to biodegrade. Similarly, on Thursday, October 7, the Odisha Lalit Kala Akademi, in collaboration with the Koraput district administration, held a competition on Jhoti art in the Padampur hamlet of the district, in order to revive the traditional art form of 'Jhoti' and encourage women to pursue this folk art. Folk art and the customary practice of making murals or Rangoli at the front entry of a home during social occasions and religious holidays is known as 'Alpona.' Jhoti, on the other hand, is not the same as rangoli. While rangolis use coloured powders to make line art, jhoti art uses traditional white, semi-liquid rice or pithau paste to create line art. In this style of art, the fingers are used as a paintbrush."

The Serena Hotel is a well-known luxury hotel in Kabul and it has been popular with foreign visitors. However, after the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August, it has been the target of extremists attacks on two occasions.  In an update to its advice not to travel to Afghanistan, the UK Foreign Office also said: ""In light of the increased risks you are advised not to stay in hotels, particularly in Kabul (such as the Serena Hotel)."" The security alert comes after the Islamic States group claimed a devastating bomb attack in the northern city of Kunduz on Friday. As reported by AP, a major explosion at a Shia mosque in Afghanistan's northern Kunduz province claimed the lives of at least 100 people, while several others were injured. The report further stated that the deadly explosion was followed by a separate blast through a Shia mosque during Friday prayers in the same province. Kunduz provincial spokesperson Matiullah Rohani told a US media outlet that a suicide attacker was responsible for the explosion at the Sayed Abad mosque. If the death toll is said to be true, it will be considered as the deadliest attack since the US and NATO troops left Afghanistan at the end of August and the Taliban took control of the country. It is pertinent to mention here that on Wednesday, an explosion in Afghanistan’s Khost city killed seven people and wounded 15 others. This incident took place at Mazharul Alum Madrasa, also known as Mazharul Alum religious school."

As per sources, the central agency is likely to summon the NCP leader very soon. Earlier, the CBI summoned Maharashtra Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte and state DGP Sanjay Pandey to record their statements pertaining to this case. This marked one of the first instances where the seniormost police officer and bureaucrat of a state have been called by an investigative agency. Reportedly, the senior officers were asked to respond to some queries relating to the investigation.  The trouble for Anil Deshmukh started on February 20 when former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh levelled 'extortion' charges against him. In a letter addressed to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, Singh alleged that the NCP leader had asked dismissed cop Sachin Vaze to extort Rs.100 crore per month from 1,750 bars, restaurants, and other establishments in Mumbai. After the Bombay High Court directed the CBI to carry out a preliminary enquiry into these allegations, Deshmukh resigned as the Home Minister and he was replaced by Dilip Walse Patil. On April 21, the CBI registered an FIR against the NCP leader and unknown individuals under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 120 B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). According to the FIR, the former Maharashtra Home Minister was aware that dismissed Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze was entrusted with most of the sensational and important cases of Mumbai. Furthermore, it accused him and others of exercising undue influence over the transfer and posting of officials.  In another development, Deshmukh's lawyer Anand Daga and CBI sub-inspector Abhishek Tiwari were arrested on September 2 for leaking a purported Preliminary Enquiry report of the central agency. This report concluded that no cognizable offence was made out against the ex-Maharashtra Home Minister as far as Singh's allegations are concerned. Dismissing their bail plea, a Special CBI court sent them to judicial custody till September 20. "

In the presence of ex-Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, ex-CM Harish Rawat, KC Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala, the father-son duo joined Congress in Delhi. Uttarakhand goes to polls in February 2022 - where it faces an emerging AAP & Congress. In July, prior to BJP selecting Pushkar Singh Dhami as Tirath Singh Rawat's successor, Arya was one of the top contenders for the CM post. Sources stated that many CM contenders like Satpal Maharaj. Harak Singh Rawat, Dhan Singh Rawat, Bishan Singh Chuphal, Yashpal Aarya were miffed with High command and had huddled in Satpal Maharaj's house. BJP had refuted any discontent in its ranks affirming that all MLAs stood by the govt.  45-year-old Pushkar Singh Dhami was selected as the new Uttarakhand CM at the BJP's MLA meeting after Tirath Singh Rawat resigned citing 'constitutional constraints'. Dhami, the Khatima MLA, has served as the State President of the BJP youth wing BYJM and a close aide of outgoing CM Rawat and Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari. Rawat was made to resign as BJP claimed that bypolls could not be held in Uttarakhand due to COVID by August - the deadline by which Rawat had to be elected as an MLA. Tirath Singh Rawat - a Uttarakhand MP replaced Trivendra Singh Rawat - 10 days ahead of completing his fourth year as CM as several MLAs reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with Rawat. Rawat also faces allegations of corruption for alleged money transfers to accounts of his relatives in 2016 to back a particular individual to head the Jharkhand Gau Seva Ayog. Since the formation of the hilly state from Uttar Pradesh in 2000, both BJP and Congress which have ruled the state have often changed their CMs, resulting in their electoral loss in the next election.

Claiming a similar issue in Tamil Nadu, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh, Jain said that National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) has cut supply to 50% from every plant. Recently, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had slammed Power Minister RK Singh for 'underminig' the looming coal crisis in India. ""Currently the situation is under control as the demand is not high. The peak demand was 4,563 MW while the average demand remained at nearly 3500 MW. We are supplying full demand through gas purchase which is costing us at Rs 17 to 20 per unit. We are also buying power from the open market to meet the demand.

Congress Vows To Defeat RJD Candidates In Bihar Bypolls,"Indicating that a split in the Mahagatbandhan is imminent, Congress vows to defeat the candidates fielded by its ally RJD in the upcoming bypolls in Bihar. After RJD refused to let Congress contest from Kusheshwar Asthan, the Sonia Gandhi-led party announced Atirek Kumar as its candidate from this seat and Rajesh Kumar Mishra from Tarapur. On the other hand, Ganesh Bharti and Arun Kumar Sah are fighting the election on an RJD ticket. Speaking to the media, AICC Bihar in-charge Bhakt Charan Das stated that this election will determine the future of the opposition alliance. ""They did not respect the Mahagatbandhan by announcing the candidate in advance. They didn't give us the Kushiwar seat. We are fighting the election to win. This is not a friendly contest. This is a battle for victory. For the first time, Congress is fighting with its full strength on both these seats,"" the Congress leader added. Incidentally, CPI, CPI(ML) and CPI(M) have thrown their weight behind the RJD candidates.  The 2020 Bihar Assembly election witnessed a voter turnout of 57.05% as against that of 56.66% in the 2015 polls. The polls turned out to be a nail-biting contest with NDA emerging victorious in 125 seats as against that of 110 seats won by the Mahagatbandhan. BJP, RJD, JD(U), Congress won 74, 75, 43, and 19 seats respectively.  While Kumar again took oath as the CM of Bihar, BJP has two Deputy CMs in 4-time MLAs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi. The differences between RJD and Congress came to the fore after ex-JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar switched allegiance to the Sonia Gandhi-led party. RJD has been at odds with Kanhaiya Kumar over his decision to contest from Begusarai in the 2019 General election despite the former fielding a strong candidate in Tanveer Hassan. Ultimately, Union Minister Giriraj Singh was re-elected from the constituency whereas Hassan and Kumar stood second and third respectively.  Senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari told the media that Kumar is just like ""another Navjot Singh Sidhu"" who will further destroy Congress. Referring to the Lok Sabha outcome, he commented, ""Kanhaiya Kumar should have supported the RJD candidate. You divided the secular vote. You have helped BJP in a way by contesting the 2019 polls"".

It recognises adolescent girls' relevance, strength, and potential by advocating the creation of new opportunities for them. This day is especially significant because it addresses the gender-based difficulties that young girls confront worldwide, such as child marriages, discrimination, violence, and limited educational opportunities. This year, the United Nations calls on the world to bridge the gender digital divide in various skills and jobs, an issue that society is increasingly experiencing as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. ""Let’s seize the momentum to drive action and accountability of Generation Equality Forum (GEF) commitments made, for and with girls to achieve a bold vision of bridging the digital gender divide,"" stated the UN.  The Beijing Declaration established the International Day of the Girl Child in 1995 during the World Conference on Women in China. It was the first gathering to recognise the importance of addressing difficulties that adolescent girls confront worldwide. The celebration of the International Day of the Girl Child originated as a non-governmental, international organisation initiative. This movement aimed to empower girls, particularly in underdeveloped nations, by promoting their rights and assisting them in getting out of poverty.  This day emphasises the importance of addressing the issues that girls experience and promoting girls' empowerment and the realisation of their human rights. Nations must commit to assisting young girls in developing into empowered women with access to adequate healthcare, skill-based learning opportunities, and equitable opportunity in a world free of gender-based violence and discrimination. Notably, UNESCO is dedicated to commemorating International Women's Day to guarantee that all girls have access to high-quality education and a better and more dignified life. According to the United Nations, there are numerous ways to contribute to promoting the International Day of the Girl Child. One can choose to share stories, videos, and blogs of inspiring adolescent girls who are tech trailblazers while collectively raising the call to action to widen these routes for every girl across the globe. Furthermore, people can also increase their awareness of strategies to address the gender digital divide and further expand the means for accomplishing meaningful and long-term change in the digital revolution."

They demanded punishment against the perpetrators. According to the police, at least five members of a family were hurt in a conflict between two groups in Indore's Kampel village. Amin-ul-Khan Suri, a spokesperson for the Madhya Pradesh Congress, stated on Sunday, October 10, that he assisted the victims in the hospital and arranged for their treatment. ""When I came to know about the incident, I reached MY Hospital on Saturday night to help the victims and ensured arrangements for their treatment. I also went to the police station and lodged an FIR against the accused,"" Suri said. He also claimed that the police's attitude was inappropriate. Fazluddin, a relative of the injured family, claims that the family was warned by certain village residents two months ago and urged to leave by October 9. He said that when they did not leave, they were attacked. The police, on the other hand, disputed the victims' relatives' claims and stated that efforts are being taken to bring the two groups together in peace. DSP Indore Ajay Bajpai refuted the claims made by relatives of the attacked family, describing the altercation as a ""local fight."" DSP Ajay Vajpayee arrived at MY Hospital shortly after the event and ordered the force to be deployed. According to the DSP, two groups fought, resulting in minor injuries to several people. For treatment, the injured have been transferred to MY Hospital. The allegation that the family was asked to leave the village is false, he noted.

The case has been registered against both the parties, the matter is under investigation.""

However, it was the post-fight exchange that stood out the most as not only did Wilder lose the match to Fury but also ended up losing his opponent's respect. The reigning WBC Heavyweight Champion called Deontay Wilder a 'sore loser' and 'idiot' after the latter did not show any 'sportsmanship' spirit after their fight. “I just said, ‘Well done,’ and he said, ‘I don’t wanna show any sportsmanship or respect.’ I said, ‘No problem.’ Very surprised. Sore loser. Idiot"", said Tyson Fury while speaking to BT Sport. “To be a top fighting man you’ve got to show guts and respect, and he couldn’t do it tonight. And that was it"", he added. The Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder trilogy was an epic battle with Fury getting up from two fourth-round knockdowns and stopped Wilder with a devastating right hand in the 11th round to take away the win. Wilder was knocked down in the third round and appeared to be on his way out, but he improbably rallied to knock down Fury twice in the final minutes of the fourth. The British champion was profoundly shaken, but he also gathered himself and fought on. Wilder (42-2-1) absorbed enormous punishment and appeared to be physically drained for much of the bout, but the veteran American champ showed his toughness while still throwing power shots on weary legs. Fury knocked down Wilder again with a concussive right-hand midway through the 10th, but Wilder stunned Fury in the final seconds of the round. Fury persevered — and after the referee jumped in to wave it off in the 11th, Fury climbed onto the ropes in weary celebration and later broke into a rendition of “Walking in Memphis,” in line with his post-fight tradition of serenading his crowds."

Speaking to Republic TV, the INC leader asserted that any solution on-ground could only be achieved through dialogue, and suggested that the Government of India rope in mainstream J&K parties to engage in the discussions. Moreover, going a step further, Soz stated that the Centre should approach the UN and hold talks with Pakistan over the targeted killings in J&K. He told Republic TV, ""I have made people learn that for any solution on ground, be it militancy, be it terrorism, or difference of opinion, the only weapon or medium that can solve the problem is a dialogue or a discussion. No amount of force can solve the problem. My advice to the Government of India, and the people of J&K especially the young people is that please come forward for talks. Government should open dialogue with vibrant mainstream parties in J&K like PDP, Apni Party, NC, etc so talks are very easy.""  Amid the recent targeted killings of Kashmiri pandits and Sikhs in the valley, Saifuddin Soz claimed that the majority community- Muslims- are shaken to the core. ""They are sad it's being thought that they were killed by someone from Muslim community by youth who took up weapons. But even they have something to say and should be heard,"" he said. In a deplorable remark, the Congress leader went on to add that dialogue is the solution to everything. ""We have Army and para forces here, but it can be done only when Modi ji and his colleagues understand that they will have to speak with the people and political parties of Kashmir. Nobody among the general public supports violence or these deaths,"" he said."

The Beatles' fans have for years have held McCartney responsible for the rock band's break-up.   Speaking at a radio show, McCartney said that he did not instigate the split and talked about who he feels was responsible for it.  McCartney taking in an interview in BBC Radio 4’s “This Cultural Life”, recalled the time when his popular band, The Beatles was disbanded in 1970. As many fans have been blaming him for the split, he made a shocking revelation and stated how he did not instigate the split. “That was our Johnny,"" he exclaimed, referring to Joh Lennon. The artist also talked about how John Lennon's desire to break loose was the major reason behind the split.  Paul McCartney said that it was obvious for fans to get confused about why The Beatles broke up as their manager had asked the members to keep quiet until he concluded a number of business deals. As the upcoming three-part documentary series, The Beatles: Get Back, directed and produced by Peter Jackson is all set to release, McCartney talked about how it was not him who decided to leave the band on his own. He stated, ""I am not the person who instigated the split. Oh no, no, no. John walked into a room one day and said, ‘I am leaving The Beatles.’ Is that instigating the split, or not?” McCartney also opened about how he was sad when the group disbanded as they were making pretty good music. ""This was my band, this was my job, this was my life. So I wanted it to continue,” McCartney said. The Beatles, founded in the 1960s, revolutionised the rock and roll sound and grew to become one of the most popular music bands to date. Their songs continue to inspire musicians from all over the world.   Some of their popular numbers include Do You Want to Know a Secret, A Hard Day's Night, Let it be, Take Out Some Insurance on Me, Sweet Georgia Brown, All the lonely people, I Feel Fine, I Don't Want To Spoil The Party, Rock and Roll Music, Yesterday, I'll follow the Sun and Free As A Bird.

According to ANI, Bolsonaro said that he wanted to fo the Brazilian championship match in the city of Santos, however, he was prevented from attending the game because he is not vaccinated against coronavirus.  Santos, on the other hand, said that the Brazilian President had not asked to attend the match, which saw Santos beat Gremio at the Vila Belmiro Stadium. It is worth noting that officials last week announced that it will allow filling only 30 per cent of available seats in Brazilian championship games. The COVID-19 protocol agreed by the Brazilian soccer confederation said that all people inside the stadiums must be vaccinated and recently tested.  However, as Bolsonaro did not have a COVID-19 vaccination certificate, he was denied entry to the football match. Notably, the Brazilian President, who is currently on vacation in Sao Paulo, has repeatedly expressed scepticism toward coronavirus vaccines. He has frequently been seen flouting the COVID-19 protocols, holidaying while his country reeled under the overburdened hospital systems, and downplaying the virus as ‘little flu’ when the pandemic hit. He refused to impose the COVID-19 measures, as he called his mayors and the governors “problematic” for imposing lockdown, which he argued was more harmful than the virus itself. Meanwhile, currently, Bosonaro is under a Senate investigation for his handling of the pandemic. Brazil's Senate had launched a probe into Bolsonaro government's, amid mounting criticism of his ‘no restrictions’ approach that plunged the Latin American country into a devastating crisis with bungled vaccine campaign. Opposition leaders and critics of Bolsonaro have been calling for his impeachment. Last week, Brazilians expressed anguish as they protested in humongous numbers against the ruling Bolsonaro government for flaring inflation, poverty, hunger, and skyrocketing fuel prices due to the administration’s mishandling of the looming coronavirus pandemic crisis.

As per the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the first earthquake, measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale, struck the island during midday, hitting roughly 17 miles south of the Big Island's southern point, Naalehu. The second tremor, with a strength of 6.2 impacted the same location around 20 minutes later.   The National Weather Service in Honolulu informed that the quakes will not cause a tsunami. Although no injuries have been recorded, the tremors were severe enough to cause damages. Several people took to Twitter to express what they felt and experienced during the strong tremors.  The lastest tremors occur following Hawaii's Kilauea volcano which is considered to be one of the world's most active volcanoes, that exploded again last month, creating lava fountains and spewing smoke pouring from its main crater. According to USGS experts, the eruption at the Halemaumau crater looked to be limited to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and posed no danger to nearby residences.  The latest earthquake is unrelated to the continuing eruption of Kilauea volcano, Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory was quoted by Honolulu Star-Advertiser as saying. Hon further explained that the quake is most likely connected to the twisting of the oceanic plate due to the weight of the Hawaiian archipelago, which is a typical cause of seismic events in this region. It also explains why it was felt so widely.   Meanwhile, a relatively shallow strength of 4.6 earthquakes was observed in Hilo, Hawaii, on Tuesday, October 5. The quake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 20 miles, as per the US Geological Survey, at 8:36 pm local time. The tremor did not cause any substantial damage, according to preliminary seismic data, although it was likely felt by many individuals in the epicentre region as a gentle vibration. "

Speaking at an RSS event in Haldwani, Bhagwat slammed Western countries for sending opium to its countries (like China), addicting its youth. He added that a similar trend was witnessed in India. RSS has toughened its stance against Western companies, recently calling US conglomerate Amazon - 'East India Company 2.0'. The RSS chief also commented on religious conversions, alleging an uptick in the trend in India. He claimed that children were not being prepared and hence were converting to other religions for small selfish reasons like marriage. Terming conversions wrong, he said that one must instill a sense of pride of religion in youth. The RSS chief's comments on drugs comes a day after BJP chief JP Nadda also asserted that the Modi govt is determined to bring initiatives to fight the menace of drugs. His comments comes amid the two major drug busts in the nation - the Mumbai cruise drug bust and the drug bust at Mundra port. Eight people - including five foreigners have been arrested in the Mundra drug bust, while 20 have been arrested in the Mumbai drug bust.  In Mundra, 2,988.21 kg of heroin worth Rs 21,000 crore was busted by the NCB on September 13 and later handed over to the NIA. The narcotic drugs were found concealed in an import consignment of 'semi-processed talc stones' that had originated from Afghanistan and arrived from Bandar Abbas Port, Iran. On the other hand, small amounts of Cocaine, Mephedrone, Charas, Hydroponic Weed, MDMA and cash Rs. 1,33,000 were found on Cordillia Cruise ship and eight were arrested - including Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan."

The nine-hour meeting on Sunday, led by 14 Corps commander Lt-General P G K Menon and the South Xinjiang Military District did not arrive at a mutual solution over the status quo of Ladakh. As per ANI sources, Xi Jinping administration didn't provide any proposals to resolve the military standoff in the Eastern Ladakh sector. While China alleged that India has put forward unrealistic demands in resolving the difficulties.  With reference to EAM S Jaishankar's meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi last month, the MEA (Ministry of External Affairs) press release stated, ""Both sides had agreed that a prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side as it was impacting the relationship in a negative manner. EAM, therefore, emphasized that the two sides should work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols"".  India has undertaken some major developments after one year of the Galwan clash. These include building infrastructure to enhance connectivity and deploying additional troops to tackle any possible aggression by the Chinese. In the sector of troop accommodation, the biggest achievement of the defense forces has been in creating accommodation for the troops as the Military Engineers have created facilities planned to have been built in the next five years within the last 11 months. Officials said the preparedness of the armed forces is now at a level where the Chinese or any other adversary cannot surprise us in any way. "

Josh Allen finished with 315 yards through the air, and Micah Hyde returned a rare interception of Patrick Mahomes 26 yards for another score, as the Bills (4-1) beat the turnover-prone Chiefs (2-3) for only the second time in their last seven meetings. However, things were not that easy for the Chiefs as they found themselves in a spot of bother when two of their players struggled midway during the game. Clyde Edwards-Helaire suffered a knee injury when the game was in progress whereas, Travis Kelce later left the field after taking a huge hit from Bills safety Micah Hyde. The two-time defending AFC champions seemed to have lost the plot and never really recovered from the setbacks as they ended up on the losing side. The Kansas City Chiefs only had a seven-point deficit to reduce after holding the Buffalo Bills to a field goal as the home team succeeded in a fourth-and-5 play from Buffalo's 32 with just two minutes left in the first half. Nonetheless, they ended up losing the momentum due to Patrick Mahomes' inconsistency as the visiting team capitalised on the opportunity and scored in two plays.  Josh Allen launched a 53-yard touchdown to Knox and that arguably was the turning point of the match as it helped the Buffalo Bills take a 24-10 lead just moments before the break and the Chiefs played the catchup game for the remainder of the game.  Watch the video of Josh Allen's insane leap over defender here: The final result of the game has been confirmed by NFL on their official Twitter handle.  "

As the Maharashtra Bandh proceeds, Mumbai Police has now informed that the local trains are operating on their regular schedule.

Taking it to their official Twitter handle, Mumbai Police said, “Local trains are operating on their regular schedule, so you can plan your day accordingly. Essential services are functioning as usual.” The police also informed that any updates on disruption in traffic will be updated through the handle.

Most recently, WhatsApp has been spotted testing a feature that will allow users to pause while recording an audio message and then record again. Although the feature is under development, it is available for beta testers of the application. Keep reading to know more about the new feature that is expected to come soon.  Currently, WhatsApp allows a user to record voice messages in a linear fashion, i.e. users cannot pause and record again from where they left. While it still allows users to communicate with the help of audio messages, there is no option to pause a voice recording in between. This causes inconvenience if the message is interrupted by unwanted background noise, notification ringer or similar disturbances. Hence, the ability to pause voice recording and re-record will make the audio message recording feature more convenient.  According to a report by WABetaInfo, once the update is in place, users will be able to pause voice recordings and continue them, recording with convenience. A screenshot incorporated in the report shows a paused voice recording with a record button showing at the bottom of the WhatsApp chat interface, alongside the usual delete and send button. While the feature has been spotted in WhatsApp for iOS, it will be available for Android users as well.   Previously, WhatsApp was reported to be working on a Global Voice Message Player which will allow users to listen to audio recordings sent to them while scrolling in the main menu. It would allow users to listen to long audio recordings while replying to other important chats, saving time in the process. Additionally, WhatsApp beta for Android 2.21.15.5 and WhatsApp beta for iOS 2.21.200.14 now support end-to-end encrypted chats backups. The feature will help users on both the Android and iOS ecosystem to secure their chats in the form of encrypted backups on Google Drive and iCloud respectively. Once the user's backup is encrypted, even the service providers such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Apple and Google will be able to see the contents as it will be encrypted using a 64-digit encryption key. Stay tuned for more updates on WhatsApp and other tech news. "

However, the recent Ballon d'Or nomination has only motivated Leo as he scored an unusual yet match-winning goal for Argentian during their World Cup Qualifiers game against Uruguay at El Monumental on Sunday. It so happened that just a few minutes before half-time (38'), Leo had floated a 35-meter pass into the area which surprisingly was missed by Argentine striker Nicolas Gonzalez and goalie Fernando Muslera as the ball sneaked its way inside the goal post. An ecstatic Messi celebrated quietly while the partisan fans were on their feet.  Watch the video of Lionel Messi's unbelievable goal here: Meanwhile, goals from midfielder Rodrigo De Paul (44') and striker Lautaro Martínez (62') helped the reigning Copa America winners in registering an emphatic 3-0 win.  Last month, Lionel Messi surpassed the three-time FIFA World Cup winner Pele to become the all-time leading goalscorer for a South American nation. Messi achieved this feat during Argentina's  FIFA World Cup 2022 qualifier fixture against Bolivia. In fact, when Leo netted a goal in that contest, it also turned out to be his 78th  international goal for La Albiceleste. Prior to that match, the 2021 Copa America winner needed just two goals to surpass Pele for becoming the leading CONMEBOL goalscorer. He equalled the former world champion's feat when he helped Argentina break the deadlock in the 14th minute and then surpassed him after successfully finding the back of the net in the 64th minute. Nonetheless, Lionel Messi seemed to be unstoppable even after having scored a brace and registered a hat-trick when he netted one in the 88th minute.  The two-time world champions ended up blanking Bolivia 3-0 riding on Messi's hat-trick."

Last week, Poland’s top court had ruled that the key articles of EU law were “incompatible” with the nation’s constitution. The ruling sparked fears that Poland could follow British suit and exit the 27 nation bloc, prompting calls for major demonstrations nationwide on Sunday, 10 October.  According to AP, the protests took place in more than 100 towns and cities, with some 100,000 people turning out in Warsaw alone. While speaking at a rally in the capital city Donald Tusk, who is the former President of the European Council and now leader of the opposition Civic Platform, reportedly called on people to “defend a European Poland”. Addressing a crowd in Warsaw, Tusk expressed satisfaction at the sight of thousands of protesters and strongly denounced the actions of the ruling party.  Leaders across the European Union has criticised the ruling by Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal. The top court on Thursday had rejected the core principle the EU law has primacy over national legislation in certain judicial areas. The declaration was quick to catch the attention of the European Commission, which threatened action against it. It also then triggered fear of what is now being dubbed as “Polexit” amongst other members of the bloc.  Critics have accused the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party of politicising the judiciary since taking office in 2015. Late on Friday, Foreign ministers of both Germany and France rebuked Poland saying that “EU membership relied upon ""complete and unconditional adherence to common values and rules"" and this was ""not simply a moral commitment. It is also a legal commitment"". French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced that Poland’s exit was now a “de facto risk”. However, Poland’s PM Mateusz Morawiecki has defended the controversial ruling by saying that the nation wants the rights to be respected. But Morawiecki has also insisted that Poland’s place is and will be in the European family of nations. The PiS has also said that it has no plans for what some are calling “Polexit”. "

Located on Marina Beach, it is a 'phoenix' themed structure spread over 14,100 square feet which house the mausoleum of the late Tamil Nadu CM. During her last visit before leaving for jail in February 2017, the expelled AIADMK general secretary set the political circles abuzz after she took a vow to ""defeat the conspiracy, avenge the betrayal and endure the hardship"" by thumping Jayalalithaa's grave thrice.  Sasikala's visit will come a day ahead of the 49th Foundation Day of AIADMK. As per sources, she talked about her re-entry into AIADMK during her recent conversations with party cadres despite the fact that the EPS-OPS combine has ruled out such a possibility. While the late Jayalalithaa's confidante had planned to visit the memorial soon after her release from jail, the then AIADMK government closed it in a hurry.  On January 27, Sasikala was formally released from prison after serving a 4-year jail term in the Rs.66 crore disproportionate assets case. But, she was discharged from the Victoria Hospital in Bengaluru only on January 31 as she was undergoing treatment for COVID-19. After receiving a raucous welcome on her return to Tamil Nadu, the ousted AIADMK leader declared that she would enter full-fledged politics soon. In a sudden change of heart on March 3, she decided to step aside from politics to ensure that ""all followers of Jayalalithaa stay together"" to defeat DMK in the TN Assembly polls. However, in the last few months, multiple conversations of the ousted AIADMK general secretary have surfaced in which she is heard promising a fresh bid to take back control of the party post its debacle in the election. On her comeback trail, the late J Jayalalithaa's aide has been reaching out to lower-level and mid-level functionaries of AIADMK. Training guns on the present party leadership in these conversations, she has vowed to set the party right. Brandishing her political credentials, Sasikala recalled having given ""advice"" to AIADMK founder MG Ramachandran besides claiming credit for bridging the gap between the Janaki Ramachandran faction and the Jayalalithaa faction after MGR passed away. In a big statement of intent recently, the ex-AIADMK general secretary declared that she will visit all districts of TN after the COVID-19-induced lockdown ends. "

According to the Guardian, the differences arose after Johnson refused to support new laws on violence against women claiming they are ""abundant."" Johnson's statement created a block on Patel's public call for evidence to inform it's a new strategy (published in July) for tackling violence against women. This will include all sorts of behaviour that could make women uncomfortable in public spaces. The evidence contributions dropped in from over 1,80,000 people, which came majorly after the murders of Sarah Everard in March and Sabina Nessa in September. Many complaints also claimed of being harassed daily. Speaking to The Guardian under conditions of anonymity, a source from the UK Home Office said that the PM had ""totally misjudged"" the sentiments of people. ""Trying to bring it down to wolf-whistling is massively problematic. But we are going to make this happen. People are prepared to put the political capital behind this, and the home secretary is among those very much behind it,"" the source said. Another source close to the PM Office asserted, ""(Johnson) seems to be stuck in the past on this issue"" adding that the PM ""did not seem to understand the issue."" Recently, there have been multiple cases of sexual harassment against women, both on the streets and inside pubs or during concerts. According to a survey conducted by YouGov earlier this year more than half of women in London have suffered sexual harassment in public transport.

While Bitcoin investors have asserted the same multiple times, JP Morgan Chase's statement gives considerable backing to such claims. Investors had earlier stated that the cryptocurrency promises quicker returns than gold and was easily storable for a future value. However, Bitcoin remains highly volatile as it is still part of an unregulated market. The cryptocurrency was trading at $56,480 as of 9 am on October 11. Earlier, on October 10, the founder of Dell Technologies, Michael Dell, said in an interview that blockchain is underrated. The comment further asserted promise for Bitcoin investors. Dell Technologies has been among the earliest companies in the world to accept Bitcoin as a mode of payment. They started accepting the cryptocurrency in 2014. With advancements in blockchain networking technology, Dell is looking forward to boosting its data infrastructure business by manufacturing high-quality storage drives.  While the hype around cryptocurrency is increasing worldwide, several companies are planning to accept crypto as a mode of payment in exchange for their services or products. In March 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the electric vehicle manufacturer would start accepting Bitcoin as a mode of payment. However, in May 2021, Musk announced that the company would no longer accept Bitcoins over concerns about the impact of mining on the environment. Other companies that accept Bitcoin include Microsoft, Shopify, Wikipedia and more. As of now, investors can use several options to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from a known crypto exchange like CoinBase, WazirX and BNS. If an investor is interested in buying cryptocurrency, then they must have or create an account on these exchange platforms selling this cryptocurrency. To start the account creation process, users will be required to submit basic details of the investor, such as their name and their bank account details. Platforms like CoinDesk, WazirX and Binance also need Pan Card verification processes to be completed before starting the trade online. Keep in mind that investing in cryptocurrency is risky because the prices fluctuate continuously."

Taiwan Sends Special Thanks To India For 'touching National Day Messages' And Support,"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan on Monday particularly thanked India for 'touching National Day messages' on the island’s National Day on Sunday. Without making any mention of China, the tweet stated 'this support inspires us to keep our democracy out of the clutches of dictatorship'. Yesterday, President Tsai Ing-wen had said that Taiwan will not bow to Chinese pressure and will defend its democracy.  'Will fight to the end & prevail,' writes Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs thanking all the democracies around the world for National Day wishes.  Taiwan will not bow to Chinese pressure and will defend its democracy, President Tsai Ing-wen said as 23 million people marked the island’s National Day on Sunday.  Notably, her remarks came at the end of a week that marked heightened tension between the two sides following what is being deemed as the largest Chinese incursions in Taiwanese airspace. Meanwhile, a spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in India Wang Xiaojian tweeted saying 'recently, certain media & individuals in India provided platforms for or supported ""Taiwan independence"", advocating“two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”, which openly violated One-China Principle. We firmly oppose that. Such attempts are bound to end up in vain'.  On the other hand, Taiwan's Ambassador, Representative, and Cat Warrior in the US, Bi-khim Hsiao commented on BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga's video on celebrating Taiwan National Day.  China has been claiming that sovereign rights over the pacific island located roughly 100 miles from its coast and has been using carrots and sticks to make its democratically chosen government surrender. Speaking at the celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on 1 July, President Xi Jinping vowed for complete reunification of the motherland, fuelling fears of a possible annexation of the pacific island by Beijing. Taipei, on the other hand, has reiterated that it was an independent entity. The US, meanwhile, has reacted to Beijing's pressure campaign with testy words and hardline policies - prompting its ally Japan, which has key trade relationships with both world powers, to eye the situation with caution."

In an exclusive interview with BBC, Kim Kuk-song said that he spent 30 years working his way to the top ranks of North Korea’s powerful spy agencies, which were the “eyes, ears and brains of the Supreme Leader”. Kuk-song claimed he kept the administration’s secrets, sent assassins to kill their critics and even built an illegal drugs lab to help raise “revolutionary funds”.  Kuk-song had fled North Korea in 2014 and since then he has been living in Seoul and working with South Korean intelligence. While speaking to the British media outlet, he said North Korean leadership is desperate to make cash by any means possible. He even revealed the strategy behind the decision being made in Pyongyang and the regime’s attack on South Korea. He claimed that North Korea’s spy and cyber networks can reach across the globe.  The former senior official’s last few years in North Korea offer some insight into the early career of Kim Jong-un. Kuk-song painted a picture of a young man who was eager to prove himself as a “warrior”. He revealed that the secretive nation formed a new spy agency called the Reconnaissance General Bureau in 2009 and made Kim Yong-chol, Kim Jong-un’s most trusted aides, the Chief of the bureau. The same year, Kuk-song said that an order came down the chain of command to form a “terror task force” to kill a former North Korean official who had defected to the South.  Kuk-song said that Kim Jong-un had formed the task force to satisfy the then supreme leader (his father). He said that the ‘Terror Force’ was formed to assassinate Hwang Jang-yop in secret. Jang-yop was once one of the country’s most powerful officials and he had been a key architect of North Korean policy. Once he defected to South Korea, he was extremely critical of the regime.  In a revenge move, the Kim family then ordered to assassinate the official. However, the assassination attempt went wrong, said Kuk-song. He said that two North Korean army majors are still serving prison sentences in Seoul for the plot and North Korea, on the other hand, has denied any involvement. Kuk-song said that in North Korea, terrorism is a “political tool” that protects the highest dignity of Kim Jong-un. “It was a gift to demonstrate the successor’s loyalty to his great leader,” he added.  Further, Kuk-song said that one of his responsibilities under Kim’s administration was developing strategies to deal with South Korea. He said that the aim was “political subordination”. He also claimed that there were “many cases” where he directed spies to go to the South and perform operative missions through them.  Kuk-song revealed that a North Korean agent worked at the Presidential Office in South Korea and returned to North safely, after which he worked at the 314 Liaison Office of the Labor Party. Kuk-song said that North Korean operatives are still playing an “active role” in the various civil organisations as well as important institutions in South Korea.  While speaking about the illegal drugs lab, Kuk-song said that under the former supreme leader Kim Jong-il’s administration, he was placed in the Operations Departments and was ordered to raise “revolutionary funds”, meaning dealing in illegal activities. Kuk-song said that during the assigned task, he brought three foreigners from abroad into North Korea, built a production base in the training centre and produced drugs. He added that the drug money belonged to the North Korean leader, with which he build villas, buy cars, buy food, get clothes and enjoy luxuries.  Another source of income, according to Kuk-song, came from illegal weapons sales to Iran. He revealed that there were special midget-submarines, semi-submersibles involved. He claimed that the deals were so successful that North’s deputy director in Iran would boost about summoning the Iranians to his swimming pool to do business. Moreover, he said that North Korea also sold weapons and technology to countries fighting long civil wars.  Kuk-song lived a privileged life in North Korea. He said that he was allowed to travel abroad freely to raise money for the secretive nation. He revealed that he sold rare metals and coal to raise millions in cash.  In 2011, the former North Korean official said that when Kim Jong-un ascended to the political throne, he decided to purge those perceived as a threat. During that time there had long been suggestions that Kim’s uncle Jang Song-thaek was the de-facto leader of North Korea, as Kim Jong-il's health faded. However, in 2013, the North Korean media announced that Jang has been executed.  This is when Kuk-song realised that he can no longer exist in North Korea. He decided to make a plan to flee with his family to South Korea. He said that abandoning his country was the “worst grief-stricken decision of emotional distress”. However, he added that speaking about the secretive nation is the only duty he can do to help free his Northern brethren from the grasps of dictatorship. He concluded the BBC interview by saying that it has been years since he moved to the South, but North Korea still remains unchanged. “The strategy we set up continues. What you need to know is that North Korea hasn't changed 0.01%,” Kuk-song added. "

In a strong statement on Monday, the Indian Army stated that the discussions focused on the resolution of the remaining issues along the Line of Actual Control. Calling out the ""unilateral attempts"" by the People's Liberation Army to alter the status quo, it recalled that External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had agreed in their recent meeting in Dushanbe to resolve the remaining issues at the earliest.  At the same time, it added that the two sides have agreed to maintain communications and stability on the ground. Moreover, the Indian Army expressed hope that the Chinese side will work towards the early resolution of the remaining issues in the interest of bilateral relations between the two countries. So far, the armies of India and China have disengaged from two places, including north and south of Pangong Tso. Despite its own stubbornness, China chose to squarely blame India for the current impasse. Speaking to the media, PLA's Western Command spokesperson Senior Colonel Long Shaohua said, ""Instead of misjudging the situation, the Indian side should cherish the hard-won situation in China-India border areas"". Asserting that his country made ""great efforts"" to promote the easing of the border situation, he claimed that the Indian side made ""unreasonable and unrealistic"" demands during the negotiations. Maintaining that China is firm in its resolve to safeguard its national sovereignty, the spokesperson urged India to abide by the consensus reached between the two nations.  The faceoff at the Line of Actual Control was exacerbated when 21 Indian Army soldiers including a Commanding Officer were martyred in the Galwan Valley on June 15, 2020, when the de-escalation process was underway. This was followed by multiple attempts of provocation by the Chinese side at the end of August. Multiple rounds of military commander-level and WMCC meetings have taken place between the two sides to resolve the crisis. Besides this, EAM S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh have met their respective counterparts."

According to ground reports accessed by Republic TV, the Punjab Government took this decision to meet the power shortage crisis which is being faced due to a coal shortage.  The state government had made several Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) with private companies at a routine rate of Rs 4-6 per unit. However, now thermal plants are out of electricity due to a lack of coal. Private companies are not able to produce according to the demand and on October 10 the state purchased electricity from the open exchange at a cost of Rs 11.47 per unit.  Severe coal shortage at thermal power plants in Punjab has forced power utility PSPCL to cut down power generation and impose rotational load shedding at several places, prompting the state government to slam the Centre for inadequate coal supply. PSPCL on Sunday announced that a daily three-hour power cut will remain in the state until October 13. Earlier, an official had added that the coal-fired power plants are operating at less than 50% of their generation capacity because of the depleted coal stock.  PSPCL Chairman and Managing Director A Venuprasad recently said that all coal-based plants across the state were facing an acute coal shortage. A similar situation is prevailing in the neighbouring states of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and in other parts of India, Venuprasad added. Meanwhile, the private power thermal plants have coal stock of up to one-and-a-half days, the state-owned units have coal for up to four days, officials said on Sunday. Slamming the Congress party in Punjab, Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday said that the power supply situation continues to remain grim in the state. He alleged that the crisis was entirely 'man-made' and a direct consequence of the ruling dispensation’s neglect and absence of advanced planning and preparedness. ""This is a crisis that was waiting to happen and it has nothing to do with the much-touted shortage of coal elsewhere,"" Sukhbir Singh Badal tweeted."

The deal was signed by the UNHRC on behalf of the UN agencies working on the Rohingya response in Bangladesh, the agency said in a statement. The MoU is expected to establish a ""common protection and policy framework"" for humanitarian assistance on the island. According to a statement released by the UN agency, the MoU relating to Bhasan Char island allows for close cooperation between the government and the UN on services and activities to the benefit of the increasing number of Rohingya refugees living on the island. ""These cover key areas of protection, education, skill training, livelihoods and health, which will help support the refugees to lead decent lives on the island and better prepare them for sustainable return to Myanmar in future,"" UN said in its statement. Under the deal, the UN response will also build upon and complement the humanitarian assistance so far provided by Bangladeshi NGOs on the island. As per Associated Press, the agreement came as a paradigm shift after the UN and other humanitarian aid agencies condemned the shift of over 19,000 refugees, from 1.1 million in Southern Bangladesh, to the island. The agencies noted the uninhabitable condition of the island despite Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina's claims of development by sanctioning more than $112 million. However, the agency changed its mind after a representative of UNHRC Johannes Van Der Klaauw asserted that the agency saw ""significant infrastructure"" put in place by Bangladesh. Following the Saturday agreement, authorities have decided to shift another 81,000 refugees to the island, which now has sea walls, hospitals, schools, and mosques, the Bangladesh government said. The decision of entering into MoU came amid vehement protests by the UN. However, an international body from the agency visited the island in March to initiate talks regarding the Rohingya population. In the statement released by the UN, the agency asserted that the change of mind came after they ""held discussions"" with the Rohingya refugee community camped in Cox's Bazar as well as those already on the island. ""These discussions as well as those with government counterparts and Bangladeshi NGOs walking on the island are expected to continue regularly and further inform in humanitarian and protection responses on Bhashan Char,"" UNHRC said. Meanwhile, those wanting to travel back and forth from the island to the main camps in southern Bangladesh will be on a conditional basis."

The research, published in the journal, Environmental Health Perspectives, examined hundreds of studies based on humans, animals, and cells and discovered that even low amounts of compounds called organophosphate esters may impair children's IQ, concentration, and memorisation power in ways that researchers have yet to investigate.  Organophosphate esters, which are also used as pesticides, are well known for their neurotoxicity and disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses. However, the neurotoxic effects of those applied as flame retardants and plasticisers were considered to be less.   As a consequence, those chemicals with lower neurotoxic effects are widely utilised in electronics, car seats as well as other infant goods, furniture, and construction materials to substitute some phased-out or prohibited halogenated flame retardants. Yet, the new research has found that these low toxic compounds are neurotoxic as well, although by a different mechanism.  Citing the lead author and neuroendocrinologist at North Carolina State University, Heather Patisaul, ANI reported, “The use of organophosphate esters in everything from TVs to car seats has proliferated under the false assumption that they're safe. Unfortunately, these chemicals appear to be just as harmful as the chemicals they're intended to replace but act by a different mechanism.”    Organophosphate esters are constantly flowing from items into the air and dust. This polluted dust gets accumulated in people's hands and is then absorbed accidentally when they eat. As a result, these substances have been found in almost everyone who has been examined. This hand-to-mouth behaviour is especially common among children. As a result, during the most sensitive periods of brain development, babies and young children get affected with considerably greater amounts of these substances in their systems.  Co-author and former NIEHS Director, Linda Birnbaum said, ""Organophosphate esters threaten the brain development of a whole generation."" She went on to say that the repercussions will be terrible and permanent if these chemicals are not stopped immediately from using them.   While, Carol Kwiatkowski, co-author and a senior associate in Science and Policy at the Green Science Policy Institute said that organophosphate esters in numerous items serve no vital purpose while posing a severe risk, particularly to the children.  All organophosphate esters should be used only when absolutely required, according to the authors. This comprises their usage as flame retardants in consumer items, automobiles, and construction materials to satisfy inadequate flammability regulations. The authors further suggested that governments and industries should seek alternate evaluations and invest in new solutions without hazardous chemicals for situations where organophosphate esters are considered important.

As per sources, while AICC general secretary Harish Rawat and Harish Chaudhary attended the event, Sidhu was nowhere to be seen. Sidhu and Channi have locked horns over the appointment of Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota and Amar Preet Singh Deol as the DGP and AG respectively. Channi's son - Navjit Singh - married Simrandheer Kaur, an engineering graduate pursuing an MBA degree, at the Sacha Dhan Sahib gurdwara at Mohali. The event was a low-key affair with tight security arrangements and Channi drove his son in an SUV to the venue himself. Apart from Sidhu, ex-CM Capt Amarinder Singh and ex-PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar missed the event. Attendees include - Harish Rawat, Deputy CMs Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, OP Soni, cabinet ministers Manpreet Singh Badal, Raj Kumar Verka, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Randeep Singh Nabha. The tensions between Channi and Sidhu occurred when the new Punjab cabinet was finalised by the Congress High Command, Channi and Rawat - without taking Sidhu into consideration. Sources state that Sidhu was miffed at the induction of Rana Gurjeet Singh into the cabinet. He also complained that only Pargat Singh - among Sidhu loyalists - got a portfolio of his choice, being sidelined by High Command in Cabinet expansion and giving a plum post to Amarinder Singh loyalist - Brahm Mohindra. Sidhu had also opposed the appointment of Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota and Amar Preet Singh Deol as the DGP and AG respectively over the links to the 2015 sacrilege case, but Channi has affirmed that the two appointments will not be revoked. Sidhu has given an ultimatum to the party High command to resolve the issue. In a fit of rage,  Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned as Punjab Congress chief claiming he cannot 'compromise on Punjab's future', throwing Punjab once again into disarray. Channi held a one-on-one meeting with Sidhu and reportedly told Sidhu that the new list of cabinet ministers including Rana Gurjeet Singh was finalised by the party High Command. Urging him to take up his issue regarding Rana Gurjeet Singh with the High Command, Channi has refused to relent regarding the two appointments. The 58-year-old Dalit leader and Sidhu aide Charanjit Singh Channi, replaced Capt Amarinder Singh as CM, five months ahead of state polls in February 2022. "

Kangana took to her Instagram stories to share a social media post, which had a photo of Jackie Chan with his son, and another in which the latter was being arrested. The title of the post read: 'Jackie Chan officially apologised when his son was arrested in a drugs case in 2014. It also had the Hollywood superstar's quote: ""I'm ashamed of son's act. This is my failure and I will not intervene to protect him.' The Thalaivii star captioned the post with the hashtag 'just saying.' Bharatiya Janata Party's state spokesperson Gaurav Goel was among the others to share the post. Earlier, Kangana had posted, 'Now all Mafia pappu coming to Aryan Khan's defence. We make mistakes, but we mustn't glorify them. I trust this will give him perspective and also make him realise consequences of his actions."" ""Hopefully it can evolve him and make him better and bigger. It's good not to gossip about someone when they are vulnerable but it's criminal to make them feel that they did no wrong,' she added. Aryan Khan was held after the NCB raided an alleged rave party on a Goa-bound cruise on October 2. He is currently lodged in the Arthur Road jail after being sent to 14-day judicial on October 7. His bail was rejected on October 8. As per the NCB panchnama, he admitted to consuming charas."

Taking to Twitter, Jay Shah shared that 'many memories' had come alive, watching Dhoni seal the deal against Delhi Capitals (DC) and called the game 'an absolute cracker.'  CSK entered the IPL 2021 Final after beating Delhi Capitals by four wickets in the first Qualifier on Sunday. By virtue of this win, CSK has made history by qualifying for their 9th IPL Final. In the DC vs CSK match, MS Dhoni, who is considered to be one of the best finishers in the limited-overs format, played a fiery knock of 18 runs in just 6 deliveries with 3 fours and 1 six. Talking about his cameo in the end, the 40-year-old cricketer acknowledged his lean patch and outlined his strategy in the CSK vs DC Qualifier. He said, ""(It was) nothing special, just watch the ball and hit the ball. I haven't done a lot in the tournament. So, you have to get that part of your system saying if you are batting well in the nets just look for the ball. What are the variations, what the bowlers will look to bowl."" He added, ""Other than that there was nothing much in my mind because if there are too many things floating around it becomes difficult to watch the ball."" The batting powerhouse is known for his legacy as a 'finisher' in the limited-overs format. Here are some notable MS Dhoni records that he holds to his name as the CSK captain in the Indian Premier League (IPL).  1. MS Dhoni played a cameo knock of 6-ball 18 against DC in IPL 2021 Qualifier 1
2. Mahi finished it off in style with a huge maximum against SRH in IPL 2021 league game

Taking to Twitter, former WB BJP president Tathagata Roy lamented the fact that Banerjee was given such an important position at a juncture when he is seeking to rejoin TMC. In another startling claim, he asserted that the state unit was not even consulted on the ex-minister's appointment. Apart from Banerjee, several WB leaders including MPs Jayanta Roy, Swapan Dasgupta, Roopa Ganguly and Debasree Chaudhuri are invitees to the National Executive. Resigning from TMC on January 29 after quitting as a Minister and MLA, Rajib Banerjee joined BJP two days later in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. However, he lost to TMC's Kalyan Ghosh from Domjur in the recently concluded Assembly polls with a margin of over 42,000 votes. Writing a Twitter post titled 'There has been enough criticism' after the election, he said, ""People will not take kindly to it if, for the sake opposing a government elected with huge popular support, threats of Delhi and Article 356 (President's rule) are used at the drop of a hat"". This was seen as a reference to BJP's demand for the imposition of President's Rule in the state over the post-poll violence in the state. Moreover, he has skipped all party meetings since his defeat in the Assembly election. His meeting with TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh gave rise to speculation that he is planning to join the Mamata Banerjee-led party.  On May 2, TMC sprung a surprise by decisively winning the West Bengal Assembly election by bagging 213 seats whereas BJP could win in only 77 constituencies. Speculation about Mukul Roy's political future started doing the rounds after Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari pipped him to the Leader of the Opposition's post. While the then BJP national vice-president won the Krishnanagar Uttar seat in Nadia district, his son Subhrangshu who joined the party in May 2019 was defeated from the Bijpur seat from where he was the incumbent MLA. Finally, Roy and his son rejoined TMC in the presence of CM Mamata Banerjee and her nephew on June 11. After a brief lull, Tanmoy Ghosh who won in Bishnupur on a BJP ticket switched allegiance to TMC on August 30. Biswajit Das and Soumen Roy, the sitting BJP legislators from Bagda and Kaliaganj respectively followed suit. Furthermore, rumour mills are abuzz about Raiganj MLA Krishna Kalyani's possible defection to the Mamata Banerjee-led party after he quit BJP on October 1. As Jagannath Sarkar and Nisith Pramanik chose to retain their Lok Sabha seats despite winning the Assembly polls, BJP's strength has now reduced to 70 seats."

Refuting NCP leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik's allegations, Athawale asserted that the anti-drug agency is an independent entity. He also added that the NCB has no connections with the BJP.  Earlier on Saturday, the Maharashtra minister alleged that a connection exists between the Zonal Director of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Mumbai unit and the BJP leaders. Malik also claimed that there might have been talks between Sameer Wankhede and the BJP leaders. Malik also questioned that on whose directions did the NCB release those three people when a total of 11 people were detained after the cruise ship raid. On October 3, the NCB busted a high-profile party on a cruise ship that was en route from Mumbai to Goa. The party allegedly involving celebrities, including actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan, was busted by the NCB after an eight-hour-long operation. Cocaine, hashish, MD, and other drugs were recovered, and eight people, including Aryan Khan, were detained. In follow-up raids after the big drug bust, the NCB recovered more drugs from the Cordelia cruise ship and detained several others who had arrived from Goa. Over the course of the next few days, the NCB arrested eight more people - Shreyas Surendra Nair, Manish Rajgaria, Avin Sahu, Gopal Jee Anand, Samir Sehgal, Manav Singhal, and Bhaskar Arora and seized 2.5 grams of ecstasy, 54.3 grams of Mephedrone, a small quantity of Multi strain Cannabis and Marijuana from their possession. Later, a peddler from the Jogeshwari area and a Nigerian national were nabbed. Meanwhile, Aryan Khan, whose bail was denied on Friday, is serving his 14-day judicial custody in Mumbai's Arthur Road jail.  With PTI inputs "

Dhoni played a stellar inning as his unbeaten six-ball 18 at a strike rate of exactly 300, including three boundaries and a maximum, helped CSK in securing a place in the final.  After Mahendra Singh Dhoni's impactful knock took the three-time winners to yet another summit clash, his Royal Challengers Bangalore counterpart as well as one of his good friends Virat Kohli came forward to congratulate the legendary skipper. However, what really stood out here is that Kohli had to tweet twice to congratulate his Team India predecessor. Commending the CSK skippers performance Virat Kohli took to Twitter. But he deleted his first tweet to post a second. Both the tweets were the same but one word made a difference. He deleted the earlier tweet and it was rewritten again by adding 'ever'. This was brought to everyone's notice by a netizen. ""Anddddd the king is back the greatest finisher ever in the game. Made me jump Outta my seat once again tonight.@msdhoni"" Virat Kohli tweeted for the second time after making a small change. DC got off to a brisk start after being put in to bat by the Chennai Super Kings skipper MS Dhoni. Youngster Prithvi Shaw hit the Chennai bowlers to all parts of the ground and when the last year's runners-up lost the wickets of Shikhar Dhawan and Shreyas Iyer before Powerplay, Shaw continued to dominate with the bat before perishing in the 11th over for a quickfire 34-ball 60 while playing an inside-out shot only to find Faf du Plessis who completed a good catch running to his left from long-on.  Captain Rishabh Pant and Shemron Hetmyer then added 83 runs for the fifth-wicket stand before the latter's dismissal. Pant's vital 51 helped DC post a competitive total of 172/5 from their 20 overs. In reply, CSK lost opener du Plessis early on but in-form Ruturaj Gaikwad then anchored the run chase. He found much-needed support in veteran batsman Robin Uthappa as the duo registered a 110-run stand for the second wicket. After Uthappa's dismissal, the former champions seemed to suffer a batting collapse and found themselves in a spot of bother when they lost middle-order batsman Moeen Ali on the first ball of the final over. Nonetheless, MS Dhoni made his bat do the talking in style and made his presence felt in a crunch game as CSK qualified for their ninth IPL final with an impressive fourth-wicket win."

Three people including Ashish Mishra, son of Union Minister Ajay Mishra, are arrested by the 9-member UP SIT. Currently, Ashish Mishra has been sent to judicial remand till October 11.  Explaining on Rahul Gandhi-led delegation of Congress leader meeting President Ram Nath Kovind to discuss the Lakhimpur Kher incident, Anwar informed that, since the Centre was involved in a ""conspiracy"" against farmers, Congress had no other choice rather than speaking to the President. Earlier on Sunday, the Congress had sought an appointment with President Ram Nath Kovind for a 7-member party delegation led by Rahul Gandhi to meet him and present a detailed memorandum of facts in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident that claimed the lives of eight people earlier this month. He added, ""The President is the highest post as per the constitution. People have a right to take the issues of the nation to him because the government has been a failure and is involved in a conspiracy against farmers. Congress has no other choice than meeting the president"".  Agreeing to BJP leader Varun Gandhi's remarks that the Lakhimpur Kheri incident was being given a communal, Hindu versus Sikh colour, Anwar alleged that the BJP has always given a communal colour to every important issue. Speaking of the coal shortage issue in India, the Congress leader said, ""It is a matter of concern because it is directly related to the development and everything runs on electricity. Many state governments, including the Delhi government, have raised the issue of the coal shortage in India. But the Centre only wakes up when everything has been destroyed. We saw it during the times of COVID-19 and many other issues, due to which the country had to suffer.""

Chettri’s hit ensured that India stay afloat in the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Championship 2021 campaign. The goal also saw the Indian skipper equal Brazilian legend Pele’s goal scoring record. The Indian national football team registered their first win of the SAFF Championship against Nepal. It was captain Sunil Chettri who scored the winner. The goal saw Chhetri go on level terms with football great Pele on 77 international goals each. The 37-year-old has now become joint-fourth in the list of highest scoring active footballers. The Sunil Chhetri goal today placed in the same slot with UAE's Ali Mabkhout for most goals. Earlier in June, Chettri scored an outstanding brace to help India register their opening win in the FIFA 2022 World Cup qualifiers. The goals had helped him overtake his Argentine rival, Lionel Messi, as well to become the second-highest active international goal scorer with 74 goals to his tally. The Argentina icon Messi then had only 72 international goals. However, Messi stepped up and outscored Chettri during the Copa America 2021, which Argentina went on to win.   Indian national football team registered their first win of the SAFF Championship 2021 beating Nepal. The match held in the Maldives on Sunday saw the Blue Tigers squeeze out a 1-0 victory. This was a big relief after the squad landed two draws, against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Chhetri and his side were eager to win the game as an early exit from the 13th edition of the regional tournament was fast oncoming. The Blue Tigers had a rather frustrating match as the side held 75 per cent possession and 20 attempts on the goal, without a payoff. The all-important goal came as late as the 82nd minute when skipper Chhetri stepped up and finished off a Brandon Fernandes-Farukh Choudhary pass and go move from inside the Nepal box."

Two doses of the Pfizer vaccine creates a strong immune response that reduces the risk of severe disease by more than 90 per cent. But the protection against milder and asymptomatic infections drops off gradually, demonstrated a study. Therefore, Pfizer has asked for and received US FDA authorisation to add boosters for many people who are six months out from vaccination.  Meanwhile, US doctors have advised Pfizer vaccine recipients not to worry. In an interview with CNN, Dr Ann Falsey, a specialist in viral respiratory diseases at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, noted that the immunity against coronavirus slowly wears off over time, however, she also said that it is not like suddenly the recipient will become completely susceptible. Falsey said that all the vaccines - Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson - are standing up “pretty well”. However, she added that there will eventually come a point where people will need to get booster shots in a bid to prevent more severe illness. Falsey told the media outlet that the majority of breakthrough infections are flu-like illnesses, therefore, there is no need to worry. She said that her “main message” to the recipients is to not panic. “You’re going to be okay,” Falsey added. Pfizer, on the other hand, has also claimed that after a few months, immunity from the first two doses of their vaccine begins to run off. This has created panic amongst Americans, who have been flocking to get boosters. CNN reported that in the past week more people were getting the booster shot than were getting their first round of a coronavirus vaccine.  Meanwhile, US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has repeatedly advised fully vaccinated people to continue taking precautions against infection. Further, the FDA is also considering applications later this month from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson to authorise booster doses of their vaccines. Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said that he thinks the third dose of vaccine will become part of the ""standard regimen"" for COVID-19. "

Speaking to the party cadre on Sunday, he stressed that politicians get votes only based on their conduct in public life. To buttress his point, he cited the role of PM Modi who gained leaps and bounds in his career owing to his humility, hard work and uncompromising approach against corruption. Taking a swipe at Mishra, he contended that a politician doesn't get the license to crush people under a Fortuner. While Samyukta Kisan Morcha accused Ashish Mishra of mowing down farmers and even opening fire on them, he denied the charge. Singh's remarks assume significance amid calls for Union MoS Home Ajay Mishra's resignation and speculation that his son was vying for a ticket in the 2022 UP Assembly polls. Ashish Mishra was placed under arrest on October 9 after hours of interrogation and was remanded to judicial custody.  Violence broke out in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 3 leading to the death of 8 persons including 4 farmers.  Immediately after the horrific incident, UP CM Yogi Adityanath promised that the state government will expose the elements involved in the incident and take strict action against them. As per the FIR lodged by the UP police on October 4, Ashish Mishra and 15-20 unknown accused persons were booked under IPC Sections 120B, 147, 148, 149, 279, 302, 304A and 338.  Apart from an SIT, the state government constituted a single-member Commission of Inquiry of Justice (retd.) Pradeep Kumar Srivastava to probe the Lakhimpur violence. As per a notification issued on October 6, the commission has to complete its probe within a period of two months. Moreover, the UP police formed a 9-member monitoring committee led by DIG (Headquarters) Upendra Agrawal in connection with this case. The appearance of the Union MoS Home Ajay Mishra's son before the police on October 9 came in the wake of the Supreme Court pulling up the state government for not arresting him. Dissatisfied with the investigation so far, the CJI observed, ""What is the message that we are sending? In normal circumstances, if 302 case (murder case) is registered what will police do? Go and arrest the accused""! Directing Queen's Counsel Harish Salve to suggest an alternative agency that can conduct the probe, the SC adjourned the matter to October 20. "

Speaking at NIMHANS, Bengaluru on World Mental Health Day, Sudhakar lamented that Indians had moved from following their religious beliefs and living in large families to nuclear families - leading to paradigm shift in thinking. Furthermore, he also rued the fact that modern Indian women preferred to be single and married women preferred surrogacy. This is not the first time Sudhakar has made outlandish claims. Previously in the heat of the Jarkiholi sex scandal, Sudhakar had dared all 225 Karnataka MLAs to undergo a 'monogamy test'. After receiving massive flak from MLAs and the Speaker for his dare, he 'regretted' his statement, an hour later, asking people to 'understand his pain' and not take him 'literally'. Sudhakar - a Congress-turned-BJP leader, is one of the six ministers who had secured an injunction against 68 media houses from airing any CD or other material that is likely to defame them in connection to the Jarkiholi sex scandal. Recently, the state govt constituted the Karnataka Mental Health Authority to collate and publish a list of clinical psychologists, mental health nurses and psychiatric social workers registered to work as mental health professionals. The registry will ensure timely and efficient delivery of mental healthcare services to citizens in the state. This move was prompted by mental health issued being reported widely during the COVID crisis. As per National Mental Health Survey 2016, 56 million Indians suffer from depression, and 38 million suffer from some anxiety disorder.

As the CSK made history by qualifying for their 9th IPL Final, a heartwarming gesture by skipper MS Dhoni came to the fore in the aftermath of the match.  CSK's legend MS Dhoni who pushed the 'Men in Yellow' over the line, decided to go a mile further for the team's fans. After he ended his blistering knock of 18 in 6 deliveries, Dhoni decided to gift a signed ball to a young girl who had ardently supported the team throughout the match. The incident was caught on camera during the broadcast. Dhoni pointed up to a young girl who was crying after the CSK victory and tossed the ball up to her. The ball was incidentally caught by a boy next to her, presumably her brother, after which a small spat broke off between the siblings over the MS Dhoni signed ball. The commentators who noticed the incident, laughed over the innocent tussle saying that it was unlikely that she would get the ball back from the fellow MS Dhoni fan.  Chennai Super Kings enter the Indian Premier League final after beating Delhi Capitals by four wickets in the first Qualifier at Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.

He stated in a statement that coal is necessary for the thermal power stations to operate consistently.   Kamal Haasan went on to say that Tamil Nadu has a 4,320 MW capacity of thermal power stations which require a minimum coal amount of inventory of 14 days. He further added that however, the current stock will last only four days in the thermal power stations of North Chennai, Mettur, and Tuticorin. Kamal even stated that all parts of the population, which include industrialists, are concerned about power cuts due to the low coal storage.  The actor also said after remembering the extended hours of power outages during the former DMK administration in the period of 2006 to 2011 that all parts of the population were badly hit, notably industries, farmers, as well as hospitals. He added that Businesses in the region of Coimbatore, Tirupur, Sivakasi, and Karur incurred significant losses, and some of them even relocated to other states. He urged that a scenario that happened during that time should never happen again. Citing Kamal Haasan, DT Next reported, ""Tamil Nadu government should get adequate coal stock from the Centre.”  Meanwhile, the Union Minister of Coal, Mines and Parliamentary Affairs, Pralhad Joshi said on October 10, Sunday that there is no threat or possibility of power outages. He stated that India has a sufficient supply of 43 million tonnes of coal with Coal India Ltd to meet the country's need for 24 days. The current coal scarcity correlates with India's economy's rapid recovery, which has resulted in an increase in electricity consumption. In the last two months, there has been an increase in electricity use. While, worldwide coal prices have risen by 40%, and India's imports have decreased.  Power facilities that formerly relied on imported coal are now increasingly reliant on Indian coal as the coal imports have lessened, putting further pressure on the domestic market. Furthermore, in September, severe rains in coal-mining areas added to the domestic coal market's stress. Stating the situation, the minister asked everyone to avoid scaremongering. He added that with the monsoon receding, coal shipments are expected to increase in the coming days, boosting coal inventories.  (Image: PTI/ ANI)"

Chasing a competitive target of 173 set by DC, Ruturaj Gaikwad and Robin Uthappa played crucial knocks of 70 and 63 respectively.

Reflecting on the comeback, MS Dhoni said, ""It's the full team (effort). It was tough when we didn't qualify last time. Emotions were quite high. Forget what has happened till now, we wanted to make the most of the 3-4 games left towards the end. A lot of our batters made the most of that period which is why I feel we have come back strongly this year. Credit goes to the support staff and everyone on the team.

He said that he has made a demand to add four racks to Karnataka’s coal supply. He further informed that the government has already received approval from Maharashtra’s coal mines in Chandrapur and Odisha’s Mahanadi Coalfields Limited. He said that his request has received several clearances, with only a few clearances left to be obtained. Panic-stricken Chief Ministers of various states are approaching the Centre to enhance the coal supply of their state, as the coal supply in various electricity-generating thermal power plants is nearing exhaustion, leading to an impending power crisis.  He informed that he has held series of talks with the Union Minister for Coal and Mines, Pralhad Joshi and Environment minister Bhupendra Yadav for the clearances and speedy allotment. Several clearances have been secured for the Mahanadi Coalfield, according to Bommai, with only a few more required. The Karnataka CM was optimistic that the cost of production would fall once the coal from the two mines is allocated. He said that he has asked Bhoopendra Yadav and Union Minister for Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi to expedite the allotment process.  In response to a question on price reductions for gasoline and diesel, Bommai said that the choice would be made with the state's financial situation in mind. Union Minister of Coal, Mines, and Parliamentary Affairs, Pralhad Joshi, on Sunday, assured that there is no danger or risk of disruption in the supply of power. Joshi made it public that India has a sufficient stock of 43 million tonnes of coal, which can suffice the demand of the nation for 24 days. ""Assuring everyone that there is absolutely no threat of power crisis. There is sufficient coal stock of 43 tonnes with Coal India Ltd equivalent to 24 days coal demand,"" Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi asserted. The present coal shortage comes in line with the sudden revival of India's economy, leading to an increase in the power demand. The power consumption in the past two months has been on the rise. Meanwhile, coal prices in the global market soared by 40%, and India's imports fell. With PTI Inputs Image: PTI"

He also urged the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences (NIMHANS) to study the issue deeply to enable the government to make a decision and formulate a policy. He also said that the experts should study the traditional family structure, which, he claimed, cured mental problems. Mandaviya stated,  The Health Minister also said that the NIMHANS should give tasks to its students on doing research and not just limit them to study books and pass in the exam.  October 10 is celebrated as World Mental Health Day across the world every year. This day aims to spread worldwide awareness regarding mental health, its importance in one's life, and why one should never neglect mental health issues. Since the pandemic hit the world, it has thrown various challenges into the lives of people, and the most pinching one remains the acceptance of the ""new normal"". Apart from challenges, this pandemic has also opened opportunities for people to talk more freely about their mental health and issues they have been facing. According to the World Health Organization, ""The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on people’s mental health. Some groups, including health and other frontline workers, students, people living alone, and those with pre-existing mental health conditions, have been particularly affected. And services for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders have been significantly disrupted. "" (With PTI Inputs)"

The Odisha assembly’s opposition chief whip Mohan Charan Majhi’s car was attacked by miscreants who had hurled bombs at him. The Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), which is in the opposition in the state has alleged that the attack was orchestrated by the members of the ruling Biju Janta Dal (BJD). The police had informed that BJP MLA Mohan Charan Majhi was in Keonjhar district when he was attacked by the miscreants. Two attackers followed the minister's car and overtook his vehicle to hurl handmade bombs at him. Majhi escaped the attack and was not injured in the incident, but his vehicle was partially damaged, a senior police officer informed PTI.  A First Information Report (FIR) has been lodged in the case and the police are investigating the matter to arrest the miscreants. After the attack, Majhi tried to get hold of the perpetrators, but they managed to flee the scene.  According to the officer, the attack took place near Mandua, within the Keonjhar Town Police Station bounds, when the saffron party's MLA was coming home after attending a labour union meeting. Majhi had filed an FIR alleging that two handmade bombs were thrown at his vehicle by motorcycle-riding criminals. The legislator and his security officer pursued the offenders, but they escaped, the officer informed. Meanwhile, BJP members blocked the National Highway-49 between Raipur, Chhattishgarh, and Kolkata, West Bengal, seeking the arrest of those responsible for the attack.

Taking to his official Twitter handle, Congress National Co-ordinator Vinay Kumar Dokania challenged Varun Gandhi to quit the 'anti-farmers' party' if  the MP feels so strongly about the farmers, and went on to ask 'What is stopping you?'  Bharatiya Janata Party's Varun Gandhi on Sunday asserted that an attempt is being made to give a communal colour to the Lakhimpur violence. Taking to his official Twitter handle, the Member of the Parliament said that a 'Hindus Vs Sikhs' narrative is being made, and added that it was not only false but also immoral. The tweet was a veiled attack on Union Minister Ajay Mishra, whose son Ashish Mishra has been accused of mowing down protesting farmers at the incident site, killing 4 farmers. He is currently in judicial custody.  Earlier, Ajay Mishra, in a bid to defend his son Ashish had said “There is clear video evidence of the convoy, with sirens blaring, driving into the farmers and killing them."" The Minister has gone so far as to accuse those injured and killed as being 'outsiders' and claimed the involvement of 'Khalistani' elements to defend himself and his relatives.  In reference to the same, Varun Gandhi tweeted, ""It is dangerous to create these fault-lines and reopen wounds that have taken a generation to heal."" The BJP MP added, ""We must not put petty political gains above national unity."" Earlier, sharing a video from the Lakhimpur violence, Varun Gandhi had said that the events were 'crystal clear'. Underlining that protestors cannot be silenced with murder, the MP had said, ""There has to be accountability for the innocent blood of farmers that has been spilled and justice must be delivered before a message of arrogance and cruelty enters the minds of every farmer."" It is pertinent to mention here that Varun Gandhi was dropped from the BJP national executive on Thursday, October 7. Speaking on the same, he said, ""I have not attended a single meeting of the national executive in five years."" Meanwhile, arrested by the Uttar Pradesh SIT in the Lakhimpur-Kheri violence incident on Saturday, Ashish Mishra has been sent to judicial remand till October 11. Son of Union Minister Ajay Mishra, Ashish was named in the FIR filed right after the incident, and was accused of murder. Thereafter, summons were sent by the SIT team which he kept avoiding until Saturday. On Saturday, he finally appeared before the SIT, and after the interrogation, he was officially put under arrest. He was produced before the court on Sunday, which remanded him to 14-day judicial custody. "

After long-shelved and untested DNA evidence from a rape kit proved him clear of wrongdoing, 56-year-old Robert DuBoise was released from prison in August 2020. The evidence demonstrated that he was not guilty in the rape and murder of 19-year-old Barbara Grams in Tampa, Florida. On August 19, 1983, Grams was raped and beaten to death while walking home from work at a restaurant. No one else has been charged with her assassination. In the city of Tampa, four police officers and a forensic dentist who testified that a bite mark on Grams' cheek was from DuBoise, are named as defendants in the federal complaint filed this week by DuBoise's attorneys. Human Rights Defense Center attorney Daniel Marshall said that the sole physical evidence linking DuBoise to the victim was a falsified bitemark. As per evidence, the victim's wound was not a human bite mark at all. The lawsuit claims that investigators colluded with jailhouse informants to falsely link DuBoise in the murder and acted improperly in the case. DuBoise had never admitted to any offence and maintained his innocence throughout the investigation. When DuBoise was released last year, the chief prosecutor said that the victims and their families are denied justice as a result of wrongful convictions. They are entitled to the truth, not a misleading conclusion based on a fabrication. Furthermore, false convictions endanger public safety by incarcerating an innocent person while allowing the criminal to walk free. Supporters of DuBoise have asked the state Legislature for $1.85 million in compensation, but the claim bill has yet to be passed. When DuBoise was arrested in the murder of Grams, he was just 18 years old. According to the lawsuit, authorities originally focussed on DuBoise after a gas station worker across the street from where Grams' body was discovered, told them that three boys named Robert, Bo and Ray had been making a disturbance in the neighbourhood. Even yet, Grams was killed six months later. DuBoise was originally sentenced to death after being found guilty of Grams' murder. In 1988, his sentence was commuted to life in prison."

He informed the media that his political philosophy will be based on the proposed 'Jammu Declaration.' Rana had proposed the 'Jammu declaration' earlier this year, a charter to build unity and reinforce trust between diverse communities and divergent regions of Jammu and Kashmir. When asked if his leaving is a big loss for the National Conference, Rana said that the departure of two leaders will not have any impact on NC as it is a 'very big' party. ""I enjoy good relations with both Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah,"" he said. He further said that BJP was the only party that gave a 'big response' to the Jammu declaration."

Holding the tricolour high, women, youngsters, and people of all levels stood with a clear message, that they won't budge no matter what terrorists may try to instigate in the valley. “The present situation in Kashmir simply indicates over remigration to what happened back in the 1990s. Minorities are being threatened everywhere. The PM packages are being threatened. There is no security for minorities, non-migrant Kashmiri pandits, non-migrant Kashmiri Sikhs, and they are feeling insecure. Non-migrant pandits and Sikhs are not being provided security,” a youngster participating in the protest said. A woman hailing from Srinagar said, “My children in Kashmir are threatened. We are becoming sick. We are broken from inside. My Muslim brothers are also feeling insecure here."" When asked over the steps taken by the Centre over the safety of Kashmiri Pandits, a protestor said, “There have been no steps taken by the government of India. ""If govt was knowing about potential signals of attacks by terrorists, why was the government silent for the last two months?"" he asked demanding security for Kashmiri pandits.  ""For the last 32 years, every government is experimenting on Kashmiri pandits. We are like testing goats in Kashmir but they did not provide us security,"" the protestor said. The Kashmiri Hindu Organisation and several members of the Sikh community held protests at Delhi's Jantar Mantar on Saturday demanding justice for the Srinagar killings. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad also held protests in Jammu seeking action over the multiple deaths reported in the valley over the last week.  Fear grappled over Srinagar after the murders of four innocent civilians at the hands of terrorists. Makhan Lal Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit and the owner of a popular and old Srinagar pharmacy was shot dead by Pakistani-backed terrorists in J&K. Within a span of sixty minutes, terrorists shot dead a street vendor from Bihar's Bhagalpur, Virender Paswan. The terrorists then killed two teachers for having saluted India's Tricolour on August 15. In the fourth attack, a civilian identified as Mohd Shafi Lone, a resident of Naidkhai was shot at point-blank.  The Sikh community has demanded the J&K administration look into the matter seriously and provide them safe cover. Several government officials in the valley have called for a strike as part of their agitation. The Gurudwara Praband Committee also expressed grief over the killing of the Sikh school principal and urged the administration to take measures for the security of the minorities. Addressing a press conference on Saturday, the Committee's Secretary Navtej Singh said that if killing minorities was the solution then it was better if they left Kashmir.  On Friday, Jammu Kashmir People's Forum came on the streets in large numbers demanding justice for the civilians who lost their lives and called for action against attackers. The enraged protestors slammed Pakistan for its state-sponsored terrorism in Kashmir.  A Kashmiri Pandit activist participating in the protest said, ""The terrorists across the border are frustrated post abrogation of articles 370 and 35A. They thought that soft targets are Kashmiri Hindus because they think if they target Kashmiri Hindus and Sikhs then they will gain but that is not true. This is new India with new Kashmir and if any more killings happen then we will come out on roads and sit and ensure that no Hindus or Sikhs are targeted again,"" he added. Image: ANI"

Ashish Mishra, the prime accused in the incident was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh SIT on Saturday after a 12-hour interrogation. The BJP leader has been sent to judicial remand till October 11. Ashish Mishra Teni and other BJP workers have been accused of killing four farmers by allegedly shooting them and running over them with his car during protests at a village in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. However, BJP claims that farmers resorted to stone-pelting and killed 4 BJP workers with lathis and swords. Earlier Mishra had flatly denied any role in the incident, stating that he was not present at the site.

The incident was reported on October 10, 2021, at the Crime Branch of Delhi Police. The complainant was identified as Rakesh Kumar, who claimed that he met the travel agency through a taxi driver. Kumar said that the taxi driver told him about the travel company and only charged a very low fare to drop him off at the airport. Kumar claimed that he was cheated by the Delhi-based travel company, whose owner claimed that he was a government employee. According to news agency ANI, the victim also alleged that the travel agency tried to sell him a ticket that was too costly. Kumar explained that the incident took place when he was returning from Qatar. He said he was cheated by the duo when he was travelling to Uttar Pradesh's Gonda. He said that he was returning to Gonda, his birthplace, after four long years. Shockingly, the travel agent, who claimed to be a government employee, tried to sell him a ticket from Delhi to Gonda for 1000 Riyals (approximately 20,000 in Indian currency). The victim alleged that he was threatened by the travel company owner, who also robbed him of 20,000 rupees. The entire incident was reported to the Delhi Police Crime Branch. Meanwhile, the police are investigating the matter and are soon likely to nab the culprit."

He further said that political leaders must not compromise national unity over petty political gains. However, Gandhi did not name anyone who was trying to do the same. Gandhi tweeted, ""An attempt to turn Lakhimpur Kheri into a Hindu versus Sikh battle is being made. Not only is this an immoral and false narrative, but it is also dangerous to create these fault-lines and reopen wounds that have taken a generation to heal. We must not put petty political gains above national unity,"" Earlier this week on Thursday, BJP released a list of the 80-member national executive council. The list consists of several important leaders and BJP veteran leaders like LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, but the prominent absentees in the list were mother and son duo Maneka Gandhi and Varun Gandhi. There was no statement from the BJP for their exclusion, however, their exclusion could be due to Varun Gandhi’s public outbursts regarding the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, as he has been asking for a strict investigation into the incident. As per the BJP sources, it is understood that the MP's stance on the matter was not appreciated by the high command of the BJP. Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SMK), which is a body of several farmer unions, released a statement alleging that Ashish Mishra Teni, the son of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra Teni was behind the attacks of Lakhimpur. The SMK claims that he arrived with three vehicles when the farmers were going back from a protest held near a helipad. The SMK claims that he also attacked SKM leader Tajinder Singh Virk, by attempting to run the vehicle over him. The Supreme Court intervened after multiple delays in the arrest of the culprits. Ashish Mishra was questioned for over 12 hours and was subsequently arrested. Two men identified as Luvkush and Ashish Pandey were also arrested earlier in connection with the incident."

Centre's Policy To Turn 'blind Eye' To Coal Crisis Can Prove Fatal: Delhi Dy CM Sisodia,"Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday lashed out at the Power Minister RK Singh for 'undermining' the looming coal crisis in India. He claimed that the government is unable to provide adequate coal to states for power generation and has failed in managing the crisis.  Comparing the situation to the deadly oxygen crisis that confronted the nation earlier this year, Sisodia claimed that nearly 1,000 people lost their lives due to the government's inaction.  Warning that such a situation might lead to a shortage of electricity supply around the country, Sisodia urged the Modi government to avoid plunging the nation into calamity and consider the matter with seriousness.  An energy crisis is looming in some states, including Delhi and Punjab, due to a combination of factors such as excess rainfall hitting coal movement and imported coal-based power plants generating less than half of their capacity due to record-high rates. Sisodia said the coal crisis can turn into a power crisis, bringing the nation to a halt as it will affect industries, supplies, and the IT sector.  Notably, power producers and distributors have warned of blackouts as generation units are running coal as low as it would last two days. Earlier, Delhi CM Kejriwal and Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy sought urgent intervention of PM Modi in matters pertaining to the developing energy crisis in the state. However, the Coal Ministry has said the country has adequate coal stocks and low inventory doesn't mean generation will stop as stock is being continuously replenished. Earlier on Sunday, Union Power Minister RK Singh also dismissed reports and of the shortage of coal in the country. Unlike the situation in China, India has a sufficient amount of coal to fulfil the increasing demand as well, he said.  RK Singh informed that the country’s COVID-19  battered economy is recovering and this is indicated by the rising consumption of electricity, due to which the demand for coal is also surging. He said that the rise in demand can be easily catered to by India’s coal reserves and termed it as a positive indication. "

Miffed by the decision, Tej Pratap Yadav announced the formation of his own student organization named 'Chhatra Janshakti Parishad'. As per Vice President of RJD Shivanand Tiwari, Tej Pratap wanted to use the lantern (RJD's symbol) as the symbol of the student outfit but was denied permission. Meanwhile, Tej Pratap has been completely sidelined in the RJD. In the list of star campaigners released recently for the by-polls in Bihar, while Tejashwi was given the top position after Lalu Prasad Yadav, Tej Pratap was not one among the 20 names on the list."

Muraleedharan will be the representative of India at the UN Security Council High-Level Open Debate on Peace-building and sustaining peace on October 12, 2021. Kenya will convene the meeting as it holds the Presidency of UN Security Council for the month of October, and the meeting will be chaired by President of Kenya, HE Uhuru Kenyatta. The UN Security Council High Level will be held to discuss matters on conflict resolution and the prevention of conflicts. Other matters like state-building through effective management of diversity and promotion of peaceful co-existence will also be discussed. The discussion is also expected to provide a platform to member states that will allow them to share insights and experiences in the practical pursuit of peace-building and in sustaining peace. India has also contributed significantly to the peace-building and socio-economic development of countries transitioning from the conflict. India’s development partnership has been demand-driven and seeks to enhance sustainable capacity-building. India said that it would continue to work with its international partners, including the UN. Russia’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia announced that the members of the UN are against the lifting of sanctions on the Taliban and easing the sanctions will not be discussed. The Russian convoy said that the matter needs careful considerations along with intense discussions before coming to any decision. It was further reported that not just the five permanent members, but all other members have asked for caution while dealing with the new Afghan government. The decision to not include a single woman in the Taliban government’s cabinet further distanced the UN’s assembly and any route back will be difficult till Afghanistan produces results with better human rights records.

According to the provincial department of emergency management, the floods have affected 1.76 million people in 76 counties, cities, and districts, as per Xinhua. The department also said that 190,000 hectares of crops were devastated and more than 17,000 homes were destroyed. 4,000 tents, 3,200 folding beds, cotton clothing, and quilts have been assigned for disaster aid by various emergency management departments at various levels.

However, very few cricket playing nations in the world play a significant amount of Test matches. Crowds in T20 have been observed more as compared to the Test cricket in some countries. To uplift the Test cricket, ICC has already concluded its first-ever World Test Championship in which New Zealand emerged victorious. Now, Australia's former skipper and analyst Ian Chappell in his column at ESPNcricinfo explained how T20 Cricket is casting a dark shadow on Test cricket.  Ian Chappell in his column outlined that the negotiations between countries to play Test cricket especially in the COVID times have become difficult.  Chappell also reflected upon the performance of countries like Oman and Papua New Guinea in the upcoming T20 World Cup.  ""Because of the short time-span involved, T20 is a game better suited than Test matches to countries that are not traditionally cricket-playing nations. Hence the involvement of tyros like Oman and Papua New Guinea in the upcoming T20 tournament. The T20 format is also more lucrative and popular when compared with Test cricket in countries other than Australia and England. Considering most administrators are myopic when it comes to matters other than the bottom line, this is a critical point in any planning for the game's future,"" he added. Chappell further wrote, ""All of these factors point to future Test series being mostly played among the traditional cricket countries. It's hard to see the long form of the game prospering in the latest Test-playing nations, Ireland and Afghanistan. They don't have a first-class infrastructure capable of supporting a player development system of any great depth."" ""There's also an inclination among the older Test-playing nations to avoid contests against these newer teams where possible, as they are generally a costly proposition. It's a bleak picture for Test cricket, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic-created chaos,"" he added Chappell then batted for a draft system which could potentially help weaker teams to be more competitive in Test cricket. ""Players are now - as they should be - less reluctant to speak out and act on mental health issues. This is going to be critical in future planning. Not only do administrators need to give serious thought to what for too long has been an absurdly congested schedule but hitting the right balance between financial needs and player welfare will also require some creative thinking,"" said Chappell. ""That could mean introducing a draft system whereby the weaker Test teams can acquire outstanding players from other countries to boost their competitiveness. This could be a way for talented players from outside of the Test-playing nations to experience the thrill of the longer game. The current imbalance between the strong and weak Test-playing countries is another hindrance in promoting the five-day game,"" he added.

""Assuring everyone that there is absolutely no threat of disruption in power supply. There is sufficient coal stock of 43 tonnes with Coal India Ltd equivalent to 24 days coal demand,"" Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi asserted. The present coal shortage comes in line with the sudden revival of India's economy leading to an increase in the power demand. The power consumption in the past two months has been on the rise. Meanwhile, coal prices in the global market soared by 40%, and India's imports fell. Eventually, power plants that rely on imported coal are now dependent on Indian coal, escalating pressure on the domestic market, Also, heavy rains in coal mines areas in September further stressed the domestic coal markets. ""International prices of imported coals soared all of the sudden and power plants that relied on foreign coal stopped electricity generation. ""Because they have stopped production, the entire load is on domestic coal,"" Joshi stated. The minister reiterating the same urged all to refrain from fearmongering. ""Thermal power plants have rolling stock being replenished with daily supply. With the withdrawal of monsoon, coal despatches are set to rise in the coming days, increasing coal stocks,"" Joshi said. ""There is sufficient coal stock, don't fall for fearmongering,"" he added. Core Management Team (CMT) constituted by the Ministry of power is closely monitoring and managing coal stocks on regular basis and ensuring follow-up actions with Coal India Limited and Indian Railways to improve coal supply to the power plants. ""Ministry of Coal & Coal India Limited has assured that they're making best efforts to increase dispatch to the power sector to 1.6 MT/day in next 3 days & try to touch 1.7 MT/day.

He further said that Delhi could face an electricity crisis in the coming days. Punjab CM Channi also urged PM Modi to intervene and take measures to avert the power crisis.

However, SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) fans are not happy with the treatment Australia's opener David Warner got from the team management. David Warner who is quite active on social media often interacts with his fans and recently former SRH skipper responded to a fan's query on the farewell video.  The SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) who finished the IPL 2021 at the bottom of the points table, shared a farewell video on social media featuring coach Tom Moody, Trevor Bayliss, skipper Kane Williamson and more thanking the fans for the support in the entire IPL 2021. However, David Warner who was stripped from captaincy during the IPL 2021 phase 1 did not feature in the video. One of the fans noticed it and asked Warner why he wasn't present with all the other team members to which the 34-year-old cricketer responded and revealed that he was not asked to be a part of the video.  In another post, Warner had written in the comment section of a post shared by Williamson, lamenting his omission from the squad photo that the Kiwi skipper had uploaded to commemorate the completion of his IPL season. ""No pic with me in there thought we were so tight,"" Warner wrote with a pair of crying face emojis.  After not being included in the playing XI of the last league match of the SRH, David Warner penned down a farewell note for the Hyderabad fans. David Warner's farewell note comes as an indication that he will not be retained by the SRH in the mega-auction for the IPL 2022. IPL franchises will go for a mega-auction and the BCCI has planned to include two more teams into the tournament due to which retention policy might change. Warner on his Instagram expressed gratitude to his fans for their support over the years adding that he and his family will 'miss you all'.  It is pertinent to mention here that SRH team management relieved David Warner from the captaincy role during the first leg of IPL 2021. The change in leadership came at a time when SRH were at the bottom of the IPL 2021 table (phased 1) and had won only one match out of the 6 played.

Speaking to reporters in Delhi, Singh said the confusion over power cuts in Delhi was done due to Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) and Tata Power Ltd's messages sent to customers advising judicious power usage. Singh had summoned officials from Power Ministry, BSES, GAIL and Tata Power over coal shortage at power plants. On Saturday, Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd (DDL), which operates mainly in northwest Delhi, sent SMSs to its customers to use electricity judiciously in the afternoon referring to the ongoing issue. The SMS read, ""Due to limited coal availability in generation plants across north, power supply scenario between 2 pm to 6 pm is at critical level. Kindly use electricity judiciously. Be a responsible citizen. Inconvenience caused is regretted - Tata Power-DDL"". GAIL - which supplies gas to Pragati Power Corporation Ltd (PPCL), Bawana - had refused to continue supply to the generating plant due to contract issues - jeopardising the power supply to Delhi. Delhi which has 6 power plants to meet its 3000 MW demand is facing reduced power generation due to coal shortage crisis for the third month. “If the situation continues, it would severely impact the power supply situation in Delhi,” Delhi CM Kejriwal told PM Modi also seeking a curb on the maximum rate of power sold through exchange. India - one of the worst-hit by the coal shortage has 135 coal-fired thermal power plants of which 65 have only 2-3 days of coal supply."

Kerala Health Minister Veena George informed the Assembly that of the total COVID death tally over 7,000 deaths were found to be not included. She claimed that the misinformation of the data was observed due to technical lapses like missing out on patients' details and wasn't an intentional act of the government to exclude deaths from the list.

It also violated the ICMR guideline that deaths of people, suffering from deadly diseases like cancer and who died due to coronavirus infection, should be considered as COVID-19 death"".

The department took the initiative to include the excluded cases in the list,” Seh further told reporters that online entry of COVID-19 deaths started in hospitals during June, this year and the missed out numbers were of earlier months which will be documented to the list.

The letter by INC read, ""The shocking incident of broad day massacre of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh has shaken the conscience of the entire nation. Even more tragic are the open warnings given by the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Ajay Mishra Teni, and the consequent trampling of farmers under a Thar jeep owned by the Minister and his family. Farmers who were eyewitnesses have openly stated that they were run over by vehicle being driven by the son of the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs.

In an exclusive interview with the state-run Sansad TV, Shah explained how Modi strengthened BJP's grass-root level organisation in Gujarat leading to its first electoral victory in 1987. BJP has marked the 20-year journey of PM Modi with 'Seva Samarpan' programs across India. Lauding Modi's work as 3-time Gujarat CM, he said, ""After becoming Chief Minister, he understood the nuances of administration with great patience, connected experts in the administration and took the plans of the government to the public. After his arrival in 1987, the first election was held for Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and for the first time BJP came to power there on its own"". Extolling PM Modi's work in reviving India's reputation at a global stature, Shah said that the UPA era was filled with policy delay, internal strife. Comparing to the smooth functioning under NDA, he listed the Modi govt's many achievements like -  triple talaq, one rank one pension, surgical strikes, revocation of article 370, economic reforms. He said that such decisions can be made only under a strong PM. He added, ""Modi ji makes decisions by taking risks, this is true. No one dared to implement the law on triple talaq, one rank one pension. Everyone was silent on surgical and air strikes, no one dared to remove Article 370, decisions like various economic reforms. Only a prime minister with strong willpower could"". In 2001, Keshubhai Patel resigned as Gujarat CM due to failing health and a directive from the BJP's high command. The saffron party had reportedly told him to resign after 'sheer irregularities' in relief works after Jan 26, 2000 quake that had killed thousands, as per reports - making way for Narendra Modi's first stint as CM. Later, facing immense backlash for inaction in the 2002 Gujarat riots, Modi stepped down as CM - dissolving the Assembly. He was re-elected with a thumping majority of 127 seats and commenced his first stint as Maninagar MLA. In subsequent elections, Modi made Gujarat BJP's impenetrable fortress winning elections in 2007, 2012 and 2017. Under his three stints as Gujarat CM, Modi was credited for the rapid growth of the state’s economy - dubbing it the 'Gujarat model'. With his widespread popularity, in June 2013 Modi was chosen as the BJP's PM face for the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Riding the Modi wave, he was elected PM twice in 2014 and 2019. Under PM Modi's seven-year reign, the BJP govt has implemented several groundbreaking reforms like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Ujwala scheme, Jan Dhan Yojana, Awas Yojana, Garib Kalyan scheme and Jal Jeevan mission. His term has also been marked by controversies like demonetisation, snap revocation of Article 370, anti-CAA riots and farmers' protests."

The winner advances to the final whereas, the loser gets a second chance and will face the winner of the Eliminator between RCB and KKR in Qualifier 2.  As MS Dhoni & Co. eye a place in the final, all eyes will be on key batsman Suresh Raina's availability for the all-important clash. So without further ado, let's find out how 'Chinna Thala' has made a tremendous impact in big matches for the three-time winners. Suresh Raina had to miss Chennai Super Kings' last couple of matches due to a knee injury but, Chennai would need the southpaw to feature in the crunch game against DC on Sunday; this is because of Raina's impressive playoff numbers. The veteran middle-order batsman has amassed 208 runs in Qualifier 1 in IPL and is the only batsman to date to have scored more than 200 runs in the first qualifier.  When it comes to the overall playoff performances, Suresh Raina is right up there and is a very accomplished batsman in the knockout games as he has scored 714 runs from 24 games averaging 37.57, and a strike rate of 155.2, including seven half-centuries. His CSK skipper MS Dhoni and other batting icons, including the likes MS Dhoni, Kieron Pollard, Rohit Sharma, and Virat Kohli, play the catch-up game. Apart from most runs in the IPL playoffs & finals, Suresh Raina also has scored more boundaries (51), hit the most number of sixes (40). He also holds the record of scoring the fastest fifty (off just 16 deliveries) and the highest Powerplay score, i.e. 87. Meanwhile, he has also been adjudged the Man of the Match thrice, which is the joint-highest with MI all-rounder Kieron Pollard.
At the same time, Suresh Raina is the only player to win the Man of the Match award in the Final, Qualifier and Eliminator, respectively. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether the southpaw will feature in CSK vs DC IPL 2021 Qualifier 1 as the extent of the injury is still unknown as of now."

He also shared how PM Modi patiently listened to the suggestions of the smallest persons in the hierarchy and how this had helped the BJP usher in major policy changes such as GST, Triple Talaq, or the abrogation of Article 370.  ""Modi ji has done a good job in the organization because he understood the nuances. He has connected experts with administration and connected schemes to the people. No one ever imagined that India could do airstrikes, it was a thing America did. But India did that. In the economic sector, India has now moved from number 11 to number 5, to number 6,"" said Amit Shah.  Talking about the changes under the 7 years of PM Modi, Amit Shah said that democracy meant inclusive growth, with included every sector of the population and every region from East to West. ""PM did a lot of reforms 370, CAA, many agreements in North East, reforms to crack down on Naxalism, budget, Triple Talaq etc. The agriculture budget also increased. From the banking sector to the FDI policy, to GST, reformations have happened in every sector,"" said Amit Shah. ""While making a policy, there is only one thought- whether it will give good results or not. We are in politics to take the country forward. Our aim is not to remain in power, our aim is to put India first. We have to help our country of 130 crores reach a position of respect in the world. He is not scared because our aim is to not hold on to political power, neither is it to let things remain stagnant. India first, that is our motive,"" he added."

His comments came a day after CM KCR launched a scathing attack at the Centre and said that he was ready to fight with the Centre for the rights of the state. He also said that he was ready to join hands with anyone for it.  BJP leader Subhash further said that the people of Telangana will be voting against KCR-led Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in the upcoming bypolls and Assembly elections.

Meanwhile, bypolls in the Huzurabad constituency are scheduled to be held on October 30 after the seat fell vacant. The elections have been necessitated due to resignation by Eetala Rajender from the ruling TRS.  Reportedly, he was removed from the state cabinet over the allegations of land grabbing. However, Rajender who denied all the allegations later joined the Bharatiya Janata Party and is now contesting the bypolls.  (With agency inputs, Image: ANI/PTI)"

And so, the Serum Institute of India (SII) has targetted to supply about 21.50 crore doses this month. This is considered a significant announcement as the Adar Poonawalla-owned SII since the beginning of India's vaccination drive has supplied 78 crore doses of its Covishield.  However, India braces itself for the festive season, which saw a rise in the number of cases last year. Even in Kerala, the cases have remained extremely high after the Onam season and therefore, the authorities across all the major states have issued guidelines to control the crowd. While AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria has urged all citizens, especially children, to remain ""alert and vigilant"" against the COVID-19 infection. Dr Guleria said, ""As we know that children mostly have mild diseases. So, due to the limited supply of vaccination, we are prioritising those people who can have severe disease.""

Thakur, while speaking to the press, said the hockey federation should have consulted the sports ministry and the government before making the decision to withdraw from the Birmingham Commonwealth Games. Thakur also hit out at the players saying if cricketers can play in IPL as well as the World Cup, why can't hockey players participate in the Asian and Commonwealth Games?  ""I feel an association or a federation should refrain from giving these kinds of statements and instead they should consult with the government and the concerned department because it is not a federation team that goes to international events, it is the national team. In a country of 130 crore people, only 18 players cannot represent India. In my opinion, they must engage with the sports department and ministry and the government should make the decision. India doesn't have only 18 players. If cricketers can play in IPL as well as the world cup, why can't hockey players participate in Asian & Commonwealth Games?"" Thakur said.  The Indian men's and women's hockey teams on Tuesday had announced their decision to pull out of the Commonwealth Games 2022, which is set to be held from July 28, 2022, to August 08, 2022, in Birmingham, England, saying they want to put all their focus on Asian Games 2022. The Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games will see 4,500 athletes from 72 nations and territories compete across 11 spectacular days of sports. The Asian Games, on the other hand, is slated to begin on September 10, 2022, in Hangzhou, China. The multi-sport event will last for 15 days until September 25, 2022.  The Indian men's hockey team won the bronze medal for the country in this year's Tokyo Olympics. The women's team missed out on a medal but they played some exceptional hockey to finish fourth in Tokyo Olympics. "

""Pollution has started increasing. 09 Oct- AQI - 171 (0 to 50 - Good, 51 to 100 - Satisfactory, 101 to 200 - Moderate) PM10 - 197 (0 to 50 - Good, 51 to 100 - Satisfactory, 101 to 250 - Moderate) PM2.5 - 69 (0 to 30 - Good, 31 to 60 - Satisfactory, 61 to 90 - Moderate),"" Kejriwal tweeted. An AQI of 0-50 is regarded as excellent, 51-100 tolerable, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 bad, 301-400 extremely poor, and 401-500 severe. Since September 18, Kejriwal has been tweeting about Delhi's daily air quality, warning that it will deteriorate from mid-October owing to stubble burning. Kejriwal stated in a tweet on Saturday that the Haryana government should also support its farmers by providing free bio-decomposer solutions. He said that the Haryana government, like the Delhi government, should assist its farmers. Spraying of solution should be provided free in all Haryana fields, same as it is in Delhi. He wrote that then there would be no need to burn the stubble. In collaboration with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, the Delhi government created a bio-decomposer capsule that can be transformed into a solution sprayed on crop stubble in farmlands. In 20 days after being sprayed on the fields, the solution decomposes the stubble into compost. Kejriwal proposed a 10-point ""winter action plan"" to combat air pollution in the national capital on October 4th. While making the statement, he stated that while air pollution in Delhi is now under control, it would begin to rise in the winter due to stubble burning in neighbouring states. He went on to say that the Central government and neighbouring states had done nothing to prevent farmers from burning stubble, which would pollute the air during the winter season. The Commission for Air Quality and Management (CAQM) issued directions to the governments of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and the National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) to set up a 'Web Portal' for monitoring compliance with dust mitigation measures in the National Capital Region (NCR) to combat the problem of air pollution caused by construction and demolition (C&D) activities. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced a blanket ban on the storage, sale, and use of all sorts of firecrackers, citing the dangerous state of Delhi's air pollution around Diwali for the past three years. According to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, all types of firecrackers will be prohibited from being exploded or sold in Delhi until January 1, 2022. During the winter season, the Delhi government has also created the 'Advanced Green War Room' and 'Green Delhi App' apps, which allow users to submit concerns about ten different types of pollution. The Centre approved Rs 496 crore in September to subsidise gear required for in-situ agricultural residue management to reduce air pollution in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) caused by stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. The Centre has given Rs 496 crore for Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab to finance machinery for in-situ crop residue management during 2021-22, according to Sanjay Agarwal, Secretary of the Union Ministry of Agriculture. There are a total of 150 hotspots in Delhi. Fourteen pollution hotspots in Delhi have been identified based on complaints submitted through the 'Green Delhi' app. According to the app, the South Delhi region has the most pollution originating points. Ten of the fourteen hotspots were found to be contaminated due to unauthorised waste dumping on the roadside and vacant land, according to data provided by the Delhi government, which launched a smartphone application. Illegal dumping of construction and demolition waste (C&D), litter on roadsides, public spaces, and the Yamuna flood plain polluted two of them. One spot polluted each from dust pollution and garbage burning, as well as plastic waste. The Green War Room will be operational from October to February when Delhi's air is at its most polluted. "

Mumbai New Delhi Chennai Bengaluru Kolkata Hyderabad Patna Lucknow Guwahati Thiruvananthapuram Earlier in August, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman explained why the excise duty on fuel prices cannot be cut and had informed that the payments in lieu of past subsidized fuel pose limitations. According to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Petrol, diesel, cooking gas, and kerosene were sold at subsidised rates during the Congress-led UPA government. The then government had issued bonds to state-owned oil firms to make up for the difference in the artificially suppressed retail selling price of fuel and the cost, totalling Rs 1.34 lakh crore to the state-fule companies due to soaring international rates. In another update, oil marketing companies have increased the price of domestic LPG cylinders by Rs 15 per cylinder. In Delhi, the price of a non-subsidised 14.2 kg cylinder costs Rs 899.50. While 5Kg cylinder price stands at Rs 502. The exchange rate of the rupee against the dollar and the global benchmark rate are the two main factors that influence the LPG cylinders price in India.

According to CNN, several provinces across China have been suffering from blackouts since the middle of the last month. The power shortages have led to increasing demand for electricity and forced the Chinese government to ration electricity during peak hours.  Now, amid the power crisis, Chinese officials in Inner Mongolia have asked 72 mines to boost production by a total of 98.4 million metric tons. The Inner Mongolia region is the country’s second-largest producer of coal. The proposed increase in the output would amount to almost three per cent of China’s total annual thermal coal consumption, according to the official government data.  According to reports, China is facing its “worst electricity crisis” in decades. The power shortage has forced factories to reduce operating days and electricity consumption. The move is the latest attempt by Chinese officials to increase coal supplies as prices hit record heights and electricity shortages have forced energy firms to ration power in large parts of the country.  Last week, China’s state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, even called on mining companies and power firms to sign up to new agreements to resolve the problem. China’s three biggest coal-producing provinces -  Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Shaanxi - have also been ordered to deliver 145 million metric tons of coal in the fourth quarter, so that “livelihood use of coal” is not interrupted.  Coal is the main energy source of China as it provides 70 per cent of the country’s power generation. Experts believe that the reason for the recent crisis could be tacked back to a string of policy missteps and poorly thought-out market interventions after the beginning of the pandemic. It is worth mentioning that earlier this year, China had even shut down hundreds of coal mines or reduced production in the functioning ones amid a national push to reduce carbon emissions.   "

They have found two cartridges, may be he had a bad aim and he missed it. But the manner in which car was driven, allegations are true. I am saying allegations are true and there is a 302 case. That is why a notice under Sections 160 of the CRPC was sent to Ashish Misra,"" the senior SC lawyer apprised the top court.

While China has already begun powercuts across the nation to deal with increased demand and coal shortages, European nations have pushed up gas prices more than 130% since the beginning of September. India - one of the worst-hit by the coal shortage has 135 coal-fired thermal power plants of which 65 have only 2-3 days of coal supply. While global supply chain has been hit by shipping delays leading to delays in fuel transport and subsequent coal shortages in respective nations, India has been severely hit by this crisis for multiple reasons. Incidentally, 70% of India's power demand is being met by coal-fired power plants. But, govt holds a monopoly on coal as its PSU - Coal India Ltd - is India's sole coal manufacturer.

Speaking to the media, the PPCC president stated that no person was above 'justice'- which was the basic character of good governance in a state.  ""Satyamev Jayate, truth always wins.

It is worth noting that South Korea prohibits transgender people from joining the nation’s military, however, it has no specific laws on what to do with those who have sex reassignment operations during their time in service. According to The Associated Press, the court’s landmark ruling came seven months after Byun Hui-su was found dead at her home.  Following the verdict, activist groups said that the decision by the Daejeon District Court advances the rights of sexual minorities, however, they also described the ruling as delayed justice for Byun, who had demonstrated the army’s decision to force her out.  Byun was a staff sergeant and tank driver. She was discharged from the military in January 2020 after the army concluded that her sex change operation could be a reason for dismissal. The South Korean military cited a law that allows the military to discharge personnel with a physical or mental disability if those problems didn’t result from combat or in the line of duty. The army had said that Byun’s loss of male genitals amounted to a disability. According to reports, Byun, on the other hand, had sex reassignment surgery in November 2019 after suffering depression over her sexual identity. She had expressed her desire to continue serving the army, but a military panel rejected her appeal. Byun then filed a lawsuit against the South Korean military and her relatives inherited the suit after she was found dead in March 2021.  On Thursday, the Daejeon court said that the military’s decision to discharge Byun couldn’t be legally justified as it was based on an assertion that she was 'male.' The court noted that the army already knew Byun had applied to legally change her status as a woman before it decided to discharge her. They pointed out that Byun’s request was granted weeks after she was discharged.  Following the announcement of the verdict, the army, in a text message said that it respected the court’s ruling and will hold “comprehensive” discussions on how to respond. The South Korean military added that it hasn’t decided whether to appeal.   "

This year's football awards will once again witness some of the top footballers battling it out to lay their hands on the prestigious award, and the modern-day greats of the game- Cristiano Ronaldo and his fierce rival Lionel Messi are expected to be the frontrunners to win the prize once again.  While Messi and Ronaldo are two of the top contenders to lift the trophy, there are a few talented players who can give the modern-day greats of the game a run for their money. So without further ado, let's take a look at the four players who can ensure that neither Leo nor 'CR7' leaves the Chatelet Theatre as the Ballon d'Or 2021 winner. 1. Karim Benzema The French striker has been in the form of his life after netting 19 goals so far this season. He has managed to score 9 goals in La Liga and one in the Champions League for Real Madrid so far, while also providing 7 assists in just 10 appearances for the Los Blancos. 2.  Kevin De Bruyne The Belgian midfielder was instrumental in Manchester City's Premier League triumph last season but more importantly, he has also been very consistent as far his individual performances are concerned. Kevin De Bruyne succeeded in finding the back of the net on 12 occasions and at the same time also produced 13 assists for the 'Citizens' across competitions. Apart from the EPL win, he had also played a key role in Man City's Carabao Cup triumph as well earlier this year. 3. Jorginho  Jorginho, who had scored the winning penalty for Italy in the UEFA Euro Cup 2020 semi-final against Spain at the iconic Wembley arena in July this year can wrap up the year by adding yet another trophy in his cabinet and that is the prestigious Ballon d'Or award.  The Italian midfielder has already achieved a lot as he has been a part of some of the club's memorable triumphs at both the club as well as the international level. Jorginho was the standout performer for both Chelsea as well as Italy in the midfield area and was instrumental in the Blues' UEFA Champions League as well as the UEFA Super Cup triumphs and followed it up by inspiring 'The Azzurri' to a Euro Cup win. Therefore, on a personal note, he can pip the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as far as his impactful 2021 performances are concerned where he netted five goals and also had two assists. 4.  Robert Lewandowski The Polish football sensation is arguably the strongest contender to win the Ballon d'Or 2021. Robert Lewandowski has netted an outstanding 50 goals for the Bundesliga club Bayern Munich across all competitions including eight assists. Apart from that he also helped FC Bayern Munich in winning the Bundesliga, Club World Cup & DFL-Supercup titles respectively. At the same time, the Polish striker also won the Golden Boot for being the highest scorer in Europe last season. Here's the full list of the Ballon d’Or 2021 nominees:   The duo has already claimed 11 awards between them. The Copa America 2021 winner has won the Ballon dOr on six occasions while his Portuguese counterpart takes a close second place with five awards to his name. "

Many of those who successfully passed the transit were moved to hotels amidst housing shortages and as a part of the administration’s 'Operation Warm Welcome'. Now, almost two months later, the refugees say that they are agonised waiting for permanent housing and would like to return back to the Taliban-ruled state which they once fled. Apart from this, when the refugees first arrived in the UK hotels, there were several complaints of ""inadequate healthcare."" Speaking to The Guardian, a doctor who’s been working with the refugees said that many of his patients tell him that they want to return to Afghanistan. One couple, the unnamed doctor said, was in such bad health that they had to be put on medication. Although top lawmakers including Home Secretary Priti Patel have paid several visits to the refugees, no concrete time for their resettlement has been announced by the government.  Meanwhile, Britain has expedited efforts to rescue those left behind in the conflict-hit country. Earlier this week, a former British soldier, who was arrested by the Taliban after they took over Afghanistan, was successfully evacuated out of the war-torn country. According to Sky News, a group of British delegates executed the rescue operation, flying Ben Slater out on a special flight organised by the Qatari administration. Slater, a former soldier, was running his business Nomad Concepts Groups in Kabul when it fell to the Taliban. In September, Sunni Pashtun insurgents arrested him while he was trying to aid Afghan residents to flee the country.  Image: AP "

The US State Department spokesman Ned Price criticised this incident on his Twitter and wrote that their sympathies are with the ten injured people who were simply trying to travel or earn a living.   Citing Saudi media, Xinhua news agency reported that a spokesman for the coalition, Brigadier-General Turki Al-Malki stated that the strike was carried out by a projectile that dropped on the King Abdullah airport. Nearly ten individuals were injured in the horrific incident. Brigadier-General further informed that among the wounded, there were civilian travelers which included six Saudis, three Bangladeshis, and one Sudanese.   According to Gulf News, which cited the alliance's spokesperson Turki Al Maliki, an explosives-laden drone attacked the airport in Jizan on October 8, Friday night, injuring ten passengers along with airport personnel. However, as per the initial reports, around 5 minor injuries were stated which occurred due to the falling debris caused by the projectile missile, but later, the state media updated the toll to ten. The force of the blast broke several glass windows at the airport, injuring a few people.    Gulf News further reported that four workers at another Saudi airport were hurt on October 6, after Saudi forces stopped an explosive drone deployed by the Al Houthis. The Houthis conducted an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) strike on Abha International Airport in the Kingdom's southern Asir Province on Wednesday.  Al Houthis have frequently increased drone and missile assaults into Saudi Arabia in recent months. The conflict between Yemen and the Houthis began in September 2014, when an Iran-backed rebel took control over the capital city of Sanaa. With the help of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the insurgent group overthrew President Abed Rabbi Mansour Hadi's globally recognised administration and created the Supreme Political Council.  Since March 2015, Yemen-recognised government, supported by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has been at odds with the insurgent organisation. The struggle led the nation's previous president, Hadi, to escape to Saudi Arabia. Thousands of people have been killed in a succession of attacks and counter-strikes from the year 2015, pushing Yemen to the verge of starvation and humanitarian disaster. The fragile cease-fire aimed at ending Yemen's civil conflict has been shattered by ceasefire violations and intermittent military escalation on both sides.  (Image: AP)"

The reason for this infrastructure is Narayan Rane, no one can come close to it. There is photos from 2009 when I came to do Bhumi pujan here and some people were opposing saying that they do not want an airport. Uddhav Saheb, enough is enough, let there be development"". In retaliation, Thackeray rebuked Rane for politicising an auspicious event terming him as a 'black mark' to ward off evil eyes. Acknowledging Rane's contribution, Thackeray also reminded that it was Sena's Vinayak Raut who had been re-elected multiple times due to his work. Countering Rane's jibe that 'Balasaheb never liked liars', Uddhav Thackeray reminded Rane of his ouster saying 'Such liars had been thrown out of the Shiv Sena'.

The all-rounder made the comment following her team’s failure in finishing off a close game against Australia in the second match of the three-match series on Saturday.  ""If you look at the way Tahlia McGrath batted today, we can see the confidence they are getting from a tournament like WBBL (Women's Big Bash League). They are ready to play international cricket. She has not played much in international cricket but got to play many matches before playing for Australia,"" Kaur said during her interaction with media persons. Pointing up pacer Renuka Singh's performance in the domestic circle, Kaur said,  ""We do have a few young players who haven't played much cricket at the highest level like (pacer) Renuka Singh. She has done really well in domestic cricket but still doesn't have that much experience. If we had women's IPL, the domestic players would get a lot of chances to prove themselves under pressure.""  Renuka during her maiden call to the Indian women cricket team's tour of Australia, ended up conceding 13 runs in the 19th over which ended the game in Australia's favour. Veteran pacer Shikha Pandey ended up giving 11 runs in the 18th over. It is pertinent to mention that eight cricketers from India are taking part in this year's Women's Big Bash League, and these sportswomen will also feature in the Hundred in the UK.  The Arjuna awardee for cricket spotlighted the example of men's IPL where budding youngsters get the opportunity to mark their presence in the sport along with the best in the game.  Underlining the call for domestic play before setting foot in the International arena, Kaur stated, ""Even when we see a young talent play, we can see the maturity in their game. They would have played at least 40-50 IPL games by now. I think the only reason we are lagging right now. Before getting to play international, if we get a chance to play in a domestic tournament like IPL, we will definitely improve."" ""In Australia, they get 20-30 matches in WBBL before getting to international cricket. It will develop your skills and give you experience so that you don't feel lost in international cricket,"" she added. Recently, Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana had also voiced in favour of a women's Indian Premier League (IPL). In an interview with cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin, Mandhana stated that the women's IPL will assist Indian cricket advance to the next level, similar to what Australia's Women's Big Bash League (WBBL) did.

Now, researchers have said that the rover, through its images, has also helped them as to where exactly to look for life on Mars. ''Percy touched down in Jezero Crater and ever since has been snapping thousands of images of its surroundings. We're definitely in the right place,” the scientists controlling the Perseverance said. Their claim is based on analysis of pictures sent by the mars rover. As per the team, Jezero crater is the floor of once a great lake that was fed by a meandering river which entered it from the west. While the water body could have sustained life, it dried up more than 3.5 billion years ago. From Perseverance observation, the researchers also found out that the river system met the lake. It was at that point that it slowed its flow eventually resulting in spilling out of sediments, this leading to the formation of a wedge-shaped landform or Delta. According to the researchers, it was here that life could have sustained. The team now aims to dig out possible remains of micro-organisms that may have existed billions of years ago. Perseverance landed on Mars on February 18, 2021, after travelling 471 million kilometres. Its first three months were inactive as the NASA engineers thoroughly checked all its equipment before they put it to work. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) revealed that the photographs that proved the existence of a lake in Jezero were taken during this period by the rover's two cameras, Mastcam-Z and the SuperCam Remote Micro-Imager (RMI). Currently, the rover is waiting for the two-week solar conjunction to end and will perform jobs like watching for dust devils and analysing the weather. "

In a strong pitch for the integration of Taiwan with China amidst escalated feuds with the estranged autonomous island, the Chinese Communist Party supremo said the ""Taiwan question"" will be resolved and ""peaceful reunification"" is in the best interest of people of both sides. Dismissing China's intentions, the spokesperson of the Taiwanese Presidential office said that the future of Taiwan rests in the hands of the Taiwanese and nobody else. In addition, they said that Beijing's approach toward Hong Kong further proves that 'one country, two systems' is not feasible. Further, the spokesperson said, ""Mainstream public opinion in Taiwan is very clear."" Speaking in the ornate Great Hall of the People in Beijing to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the revolution that ended the country's last imperial dynasty, the Chinese Head of State said that the biggest obstacle to the reunification of China was the 'Taiwan Independence'. Xi Jinping, in his address, asserted that the Taiwan question is purely an internal matter for China, one which calls for no external interference. Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is an island that shares maritime borders with China (People's Republic of China, PRC). The political, social and international status of the island state continues to be contentious as a result of the Chinese Civil War and a subsequent split of China namely, ROC and PRC. The question persisted through decades whether Taiwan should remain a territory of ROC or merge with the mainland under the newly-formed PRC. The Taiwan issue subsists in the international organisational system and points out whether Taiwan's existence as a sovereign state as part of both ROC and PRC should be legitimised. Currently, the Taiwan identity row hinges on subjects and matters of international law as well.  In 1971, after the vote by a majority in the United Nations, PRC was recognised. However, ROC continued to claim itself as the legitimate representative of China compelling Taiwan to maintain unofficial and representational ties with states and institutions. While the island is claimed by the PRC, the Xi Jinping-led regime refuses to acknowledge and recognise Taiwan's independent diplomatic relations with foreign entities.

The 'maun vrat' will be observed between 10 am and 1 pm outside Raj Bhavans or central government offices on Monday. Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu is already observing 'maun' since Friday night when he reached Uttar Pradesh. He also observed a hunger strike, which was withdrawn the following day after accused Ashish Mishra went to the police for interrogation. Taking a dig at the Congress' agitation, Haryana home minister Anil Vij said Sidhu's 'maun vrat' is actually beneficial for his party and the country. The Opposition party is now aiming at nationwide agitation over the Lakhimpur Kheri tragedy in which 8 people including four farmers were killed. On Saturday, Youth Congress workers took out protests in New Delhi and clashed with Delhi Police as they tried to break barricades.  Earlier today, sources told Republic TV that Ashish Mishra has been detained by the police for his alleged involvement in the October 3 incident. Hours after that, Ashish was arrested after he was interrogated by the UP Special Investigation Team in connection with the violence. As per the FIR lodged by the UP police, three vehicles ferrying the Union Minister son and 15-20 unknown persons allegedly drove towards the protest site in Banbirpur village at high speed. The complainant alleged that Ashish Misra, who was was sitting on the left seat of his Mahindra Thar vehicle, fired at protesters and began to mow down farmers. Meanwhile, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farm unions, said farmers from various states would arrive at Lakhimpur Kheri on October 12 to mourn the death of four farmers and a journalist killed in the incident.

Sputnik’s report from Paris stated that the Yellow Vests activists were seen hitting the pavement to march against the social and economic injustice along with mandatory COVID-19 passes. This comes after French President Emmanuel Macron on July 12 announced a range of fresh restrictions to contain the spread of Coronavirus.  From August, French restaurants, bars and other public spaces along with long-distance trains require a special pass to indicate that the person is either COVID-19 negative or is vaccinated against the disease. However, Macron’s one move has sparked a widespread backlash from the citizens who started protesting against the same, every Saturday since mid-July. The ‘Yellow-Vest’ movement emerged in 2018 after demonstrations witnessed a series of rallies against the fuel tax hikes. However, in recent years, the group has emerged to become a full-fledged movement with protests resulting in violence between the activists and law enforcement.  Meanwhile, French Prime Minister Jean Castex had announced last month that the nation’s authorities are working on a bill to extend the Health Pass requirement in the country. As per French newspaper Le Parisien, the new bill to extend the pass requirement would be tabled for the lawmakers on October 13. Weighing in on the decision, Castex said that even though the requirement might seem paradoxical to further extend the health pass rule right now especially when nations are lifting restrictions, citizens should keep a pass while attending some places.  Castex indicating the extension of the health pass rule came after French President Emmanuel Macron said that the restrictions might be lifted in some of the regions where the COVID-19 infection rates are constantly decreasing. Meanwhile, the French government’s statement said, “The “health pass” is implemented as part of the national reopening plan. It makes it possible to limit the risks of epidemic spread, to minimize the probability of contamination in risky situations, and therefore the pressure on the healthcare system while allowing certain activities or places to be kept open in addition to the health protocols specific to each individual sector.”"

Vij also slammed the Congress and called it a sinking ship.

Earlier on Thursday, Sidhu stated that he carry out a hunger strike at the residence of the deceased until action is taken against MoS Ajay Misra's son Ashish Misra. On October 3, when farmers were protesting against the three Farm Laws at Lakhimpur Kheri outside an event venue where Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya was scheduled to be present, one of the farmers was allegedly shot dead by Union MoS Ajay Misra Teni's son Ashish Misra and two farmers were killed after his car ran over them. Before the killings, the protesters were seen holding black flags against Maurya's arrival at Maharaja Agrasen Ground. After the incident, farmers allegedly started pelting stones at the car which had overturned, killing 4 people - including Misra's driver. The bodies of the four farmers were kept at the spot as farm leaders said that last rites will not be performed until their demands are met. Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) has demanded immediate removal of Union MoS Ajay Kumar Misra from his post and the booking of his son for murder. However, Ashish Misra has refuted those allegations and said that he was not present at the spot when the violence took place. The UP police on Monday had filed an FIR against Ashish Misra accusing him of murder. Misra, who was summoned by police in connection to the probe of the violence, did not report on Friday. His father Ajay Misra said that his absence was due to ""health reasons."" However, Ashish Misra arrived at the Crime Branch office, Lakhimpur, on Saturday and has been detained by the police.

Joshi, however, assured that the condition would be 'alright' in the next three to four days. Heavy rainfall this year also contributed to the coal shortage, he said. Speaking to reporters, the Union Minister said, ""If you compare with the past many years, coal production and dispatch have been the highest in September and especially in October. In another three to four days, things will be alright."" He informed that international prices of imported coals soared all of the sudden and power plants that relied on foreign coal stopped electricity generation. ""Because they have stopped production, the entire load is on domestic coal,"" Joshi stated. Core Management Team (CMT) is closely monitoring and managing coal stocks on regular basis and ensuring follow up actions with Coal India Limited and Indian Railways to improve coal supply to the power plants. ""Ministry of Coal & Coal India Limited have assured that they're making best efforts to increase dispatch to power sector to 1.6 MT/day in next 3 days & try to touch 1.7 MT/day. It's likely to help in gradual build-up of coal stocks at power plants in near future,"" the ministry said in a statement. The current coal crisis is due to the sudden revival of India's economy, leading to an increase in demand for power. The power consumption in the past two months has been on the uptick. At the same time, coal prices in the global market surged by 40% and India's imports fell. Power plants that rely on imported coal and are now dependent on Indian coal, increasing pressure on the domestic market. Also, heavy rains in coal mine areas in September further stressed the domestic coal markets. Earlier in the day, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and ensure adequate coal supply to thermal power plants providing electricity to the national capital. He further said that Delhi could face an electricity crisis in the coming days. Punjab CM Channi also urged PM Modi to intervene and take measures to avert power crisis. "

Uttarakhand Director General of Police Ashok Kumar informed that Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had recently asked the Police Department to put up a proposal for enacting a more stringent anti-conversion law. The Police Department has forwarded a two-page proposal to the government to amend the state’s anti-conversion law on the line of that for Uttar Pradesh. On September 10, CM Dhami had informed that the police authorities had been directed to undertake strong steps towards forced religious conversions and practices of 'love jihad' in Uttarakhand. While speaking to the press, Dhami had stated that the state administration will strengthen the law prohibiting forcible religious transformations.  “Information will be gathered about incidents of forced religious conversions and love jihad in the state. Our police will work with more strictness against 'love jihad' and we will also make the law against it more strict,"" CM Dhami had said.  The Uttarakhand Freedom Of Religion Act, 2018, was approved by the state government in April 2018, making ""forced or fraudulent conversions are done through force or allurement"" are considered as non-bailable crimes punishable by up to five years in jail.  The governments of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh this year approved legislation that was designed to prevent religious conversions by deception, force or other dubious ways, such as matrimony. The Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Bill, 2021, was approved by the Yogi Adityanath administration in February. Three types of sections are implemented in the law such as if a juvenile or a woman from a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe gets converted the individuals who will be found to be guilty, receive a sentence of three to ten years in prison and a minimum penalty of Rs 25,000.

The match will commence live at 12:15 AM IST on October 11 from the San Siro. Ahead of the final, Spain coach Luis Enrique and France coach Didier Deschamps explained what it would mean for their sides to lift the trophy. Both teams will have the opportunity to lift their first-ever UEFA Nations League title on Sunday, a competition that began in 2018 to increase the number of competitive games between international teams by reducing friendlies. While speaking to UEFA.com ahead of the final, France manager Didier Deschamps insisted that this competition brings the best out of teams as it features the best teams from Europe, unlike other competitions. ""When we come up against sides who are a bit weaker on paper, players are aware of that, and it’s difficult to find the 'adrenalin,' so to speak, to motivate yourself and be highly competitive. When you look at the groups, they're the best national sides, since League A is made up of the best national teams in Europe,"" said Deschamps. The France boss added that it would be hugely satisfying for the team to win the UEFA Nations League as it is an additional trophy added to international football. This is because at first, 'there were two international titles, the EURO and the World Cup.' But now there are 'three with the Nations League'. Spain football manager Luis Enrique said that winning the UEFA Nations League would be special for his side as they are playing against the world champions. ""This is a competition that we would love to win. If we’re able to put pressure on, as we usually put pressure on, if we are able to have the ball and find the spaces as I think we can find them, it will be a difficult match for them. We're going to play against the world champions - of course, for us, it would be very important to win,"" said Enrique. France won the 2018 World Cup by defeating Croatia 4-2."

The country's electricity grid has completely shut down after its two main power stations ran out of fuel, reported Sky News citing media reports. After the supplies of diesel were exhausted, the al Zahrani and Deir Ammar power stations stopped functioning, and energy production fell below 200 megawatts. A government official informed that the Lebanese power network entirely stopped working on Saturday's noon and it is highly unlikely to reopen until next Monday. The state energy corporation would try to operate the power plants temporarily using the army's fuel oil reserve, said the official, adding that it would not happen anytime soon as reported by The Guardian.  Meanwhile, experts have said that a proposal recently put forward by the US ambassador in Lebanon to resurrect a transnational gas pipeline running from Egypt to Lebanon could help in solving the issue to some extent, but it is far from a long-term solution to the country's ongoing inability to generate the required electricity. On Wednesday, October 6, Energy ministers from Egypt, Syria and Jordan met in Amman to express their willingness to enable gas deliveries to energy-strapped Lebanon. Lebanese officials have stated that the World Bank has volunteered to fund the gas project, but have supplied no further specifics. Lebanon has also been awarded a number of international loans and grants in the last two years, including from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The loans were granted on the condition that the country would undertake transparency and corruption reforms, which its ruling class is yet to achieve, even as the crisis-struck nation slips deeper into poverty and dysfunction, reported Sky news. According to the United Nations, 78% of Lebanon's population lives in poverty, with high unemployment and a currency that has tumbled in value. In the month of August, at least 28 people had lost their lives and many were left injured after a fuel tank exploded at a warehouse in northern Lebanon where fuel was illegally stored. It should be mentioned here that the country is exacerbated by corruption and weak government, which impacts practically every aspect of life and has seen the Lebanese currency plummet by 90% since 2019, reported Sky News citing the UN report.

The minister left for Delhi earlier on Saturday. Sources aware of the development said that the power-sharing formula between Chhatisgarh Health Minister T S Singh Deo and CM Baghel is likely to be discussed in the meet. It is pertinent to mention here that following the ruckus in the Punjab Congress, a crux is evident in the Chhattisgarh Congress after 7-8 MLAs of the Bhupesh Baghel camp on September 29 set their foot in Delhi to meet the Congress High Command. Sources informed that a similar faction of 3-4 MLAs of Health Minister T S Singh Deo's camp was likely to visit Delhi soon. As per sources of Republic Media Network, MLAs of the Bhupesh Baghel camp approached Delhi to hold talks with the party heavyweights regarding the political changes taking place in the Chattisgarh Congress and to understand the party high command's stand on it. Baghel recently created disarray in the opposition ranks by attempting a veiled criticism of TMC on Friday. Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel blazed guns at poll-strategist Prashant Kishor after the latter expressed doubts over the grand old party's revival.  Kishor had stated that people who are expecting a 'quick, spontaneous revival' of the Congress-led Opposition based on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident are in for a 'big disappoinment'. He also asserted that there are no 'quick fix solutions' for the deep-rooted problems and structural weakness within the party.  Hitting back at the election strategist, whose I-PAC outfit is creating a roadmap for the Trinamool Congress to defeat BJP at the national level, Baghel accused the TMC of poaching INC functionaries. ""People looking for a 'national' alternative based on poaching INC functionaries, who can’t win even their own seats, is in for a big disappointment."" said Baghel, taking a swipe at the TMC.  He was referring to the recent induction of ex-Goa Chief Minister Luizinho Faleiro into the TMC. The senior Congress leader was reportedly approached by Prashant Kishor, which inspired his decision to switch loyalties. Baghel accused Mamata Banerjee's party of poaching Congress leaders in election-going states when she failed to retain her own Nandigram seat against BJP's Suvendu Adhikari. TMC responded to it by tweeting,  The Health Minister had been asserting that it was promised to him that there would be a shift in the Chief Minister seat after half the tenure, a seat he says he has been promised. However, CM Baghel, after his recent visit to New Delhi, displayed high spirits and confidence about his position in the party. On the other hand, amid the political uncertainty over the reported power-sharing formula between the duo, Singh Deo recently maintained that the issue will be solved soon.""This question (power-sharing formula) comes up each time and everywhere, hence I believe that the solution will come soon,"" Singh Deo had said replying to media persons. Meanwhile, CM Bhagel, during a recent event, had responded to a bunch of supporters' slogan of 'Kaka Zindabad (Long Live Kaka), in his speech and said, ""Kaka Abhi Zinda Hai"" (Kaka is still alive). The video clip of Baghel's statement was shared widely by his supporters on several social media platforms. The CM himself shared the clip on his Twitter and Facebook accounts, making it a political statement. Image: PTI/ANI"

The metropolitan magistrate's court denied bail to the eight accused, who were arrested under various sections of the NDPS Act in connection with the alleged seizure of drugs from a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast.  During the hearing of the bail plea, Aryan Khan's lawyer Satish Maneshinde maintained that no drug was found in Aryan's possession. The lawyer, stressing for bail, said, ""This interrogation, confrontation can take place even if the accused is out on bail.""  Munmun Dhamecha's lawyer also maintained that no narcotics substance was recovered from her. Arbaaz Merchant's lawyer also pleaded bail saying that the court has the power to discharge Arbaaz if no evidence is found. However, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh, appearing for the NCB, questioned the maintainability of the bail pleas, which were strongly opposed by the probe agency. He claimed that the bail pleas are not maintainable before this court as they are triable before the sessions court. It may be noted here that the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) alleged in its panchanama on Saturday that Arbaaz A Merchant had procured drugs for Aryan Khan to be consumed on the Cordelia Cruise ship. Upon confrontation, Aryan reportedly admitted that he planned to consume 'Charas' drug during the sail.  After hearing both sides of the argument, the court on Friday ruled that the accused were arrested under Sections 94/2021 of the NDPS Act for which prescribed punishment is more than three years of imprisonment. Stating that all the offences are triable by the Special Court, the magistrate refused to entertain the bail application.  Aryan Khan, whose bail was denied, is serving his 14-day judicial custody in Mumbai's Arthur Road jail.  On October 3, the NCB busted a rave party on a cruise ship that was en route from Mumbai to Goa, following an eight-hour-long operation. Cocaine, hashish, MD, and other drugs were recovered, and eight people, including Aryan Khan (23), were detained. In follow-up raids after the big bust, the NCB recovered more drugs from the Cordelia cruise and detained several others who had landed from Goa. Over the course of the next few days, the NCB arrested more people and seized 2.5 grams of ecstasy, 54.3 grams of Mephedrone, a small quantity of Multi strain Cannabis and Marijuana from their possession. Later, a peddler from the Jogeshwari area and a Nigerian national were also nabbed, taking the total number of arrests in the case to 18. "

Following a meeting with the National Security Committee (NSC) to review many security matters in light of the current situation in Afghanistan, Imran Khan made the decision. NSC is Pakistan's top venue for security coordination, with senior Federal Ministers, National Security Adviser, service chiefs and intelligence officials in attendance, according to Dawn. The government also intends to offer a financial and technical package to the Taliban regime, which is facing an economic collapse and a humanitarian disaster. The country's drought has exacerbated the situation. According to UNICEF, more than 18 million Afghans require immediate aid, with nearly a million children at risk of famine. The international community has contributed humanitarian relief to Afghanistan. The Taliban's worldwide recognition depends on whether they meet the demands of an inclusive ruling structure, respect for human rights and fulfilment of counter-terrorism obligations. The world, on the other hand, is dissatisfied with the Taliban's progress in these criteria. The necessity of international collaboration on constructive political and economic engagement with Afghanistan's interim administration was also emphasised in the discussion, according to the PMO. Pakistan's National Security Advisor (NSA) Moeed Yusuf met with United States Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman a few days ago and told her that the international community should cooperate with the Taliban's newly created administration in Afghanistan. Since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, Islamabad has urged the international community to recognise the country's interim government.  According to Al Arabiya Post, Imran Khan promised three years ago on September 18, 2018 that Afghan refugees would be granted full citizenship, but the promise is yet to be met. The Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan has aggravated the issue, fostering instability in the region and resulting in a significant influx of Afghan refugees in Pakistan. (Inputs from ANI) Image: AP"

On Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik's allegations of BJP's links in the case, the Leader of Opposition (LoP) said that those who are clean were released by NCB. NCB has very clearly said that those who were clean were released, he said. ""The drug is a menace. Politicising it is a very wrong thing. One NCP associate's son was also released later after being found clean so we do not want to bring their name because we think politicising this issue is wrong and we should be united in the fight against drug menace,"" the BJP leader stated. His response comes after NCP leader Nawab Malik alleged that Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) allowed two people, including one of them associated with BJP, to leave Cordelia ship even as the raid was underway on October 2. He had also claimed that Aryan Khan's arrest was 'forgery'. ""For the last one month, the information was being circulated to crime reporters that the next target is actor Shah Rukh Khan,"" he said. He also alleged Manish Bhanushali, a person who was seen with Arbaaz Merchant, also had BJP links while showing a picture with PM Modi and Amit Shah. He also questioned NCB Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede's with one, KP Gosavi, whose selfie with Aryan went viral. Meanwhile, Bhanushali has denied Malik's claim and claimed that he tipped NCB about the presence of drugs, and didn't know Aryan Khan would be there. The anti-drug agency refuted NCP allegations and called them 'frivolous'. ""All allegations levelled against NCB are baseless, motivated, afterthought and prejudice. Such statements are based on conjecture and assumptions that are frivolous and malicious in view of documents and records produced by NCB,"" NCB Deputy DG Gyaneshwar Singh said. Earlier, the agency had stated that allegations made against it are likely retaliatory due to its past action. Nawab Malik's son-in-law had earlier been arrested in a drug case. "

The North Campus college had demanded perfect scores for admission to the course in the first list and the cut-off is unchanged in the second list released on Saturday. ""In the first list, we had approved 33 admissions for 31 seats but only 29 students paid the fees. We have only two vacant seats and that is why we have not reduced the cut-off because we do not want to have over-admissions,"" said Tanvir Aeijaz, associate professor of political science at the college. The cut-off for BSc (Honours) Physics has come down to 99.33 per cent from 100 per cent, while the cut-off for a BA programme combination has dropped to 99.5 per cent from 100 per cent at Ramjas College, which was one of the eight colleges to have asked for perfect scores. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya (DDU) College has effected a 1.5-per cent decrease for BSc (Honours) Computer Science, for which it had sought perfect scores in the first list. The cut-off for the course is now pegged at 98.5 per cent but it is closed for admission for the SC, ST, PwD and EWS categories. ""We analysed the data and found that the 100 per cent scorers have taken admission to Hansraj (which also had a 100-per cent cut-off) for the subject. We are expecting that students who have scored between 98.5 per cent and 100 per cent will apply for the 24 seats on offer and those will be filled,"" DDU principal Hem Chand Jain said. He said they had kept the cut-off at 100 per cent as a precautionary measure since the course is in demand and the college has improved its NIRF ranking from 15 to 13 this year. DDU was ranked above Hansraj in the NIRF rankings for colleges. The other colleges that had pegged the cut-off at 100 per cent for the course were Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies (SSCBS) and Hansraj College, with the former also drawing a blank for the course. SSCBS has also sought 98.5 per cent for admission to the course, while Hansraj has closed admission to the course. ""We have had 32 admissions as against 23 seats for the course in our college. There is a chance that some students might withdraw admissions after they get results of their engineering exams,"" Hansraj college principal Rama Sharma said. Hindu College, which had pegged a 100-per cent cut-off for BA (Honours)Political Science, has closed admission to the course in the second list. According to Manish Kansal, convenor, admissions at the college, they have admitted almost six times the number of students as against the 20 seats in the unreserved category. The Shri Ram College of Commerce, which had pegged the cut-offs for BA (Honours) Economics and BCom (Honours) at 100 per cent, has reduced the asking marks to 99.75 per cent and 99.12 per cent respectively in the second list. Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College also did not find any perfect scorer for the BCom programme in the first list and has brought the cut-off down to 98.75 per cent. The Jesus and Mary college had pegged the cut-off for BA (Honours) Psychology at 100 per cent for those who do not include the subject while calculating their best-of-four percentage. The cut-off for students who were to include the subject in their best-of-four subjects' (BFS) marks was 99 per cent. The college has not issued a second list for the course, which means the seats have been filled under the first list. Principals of colleges that had kept the cut-offs at 100 per cent in the first list had said the perfect score was a precautionary measure to avoid over-admissions. It was probably for the first time in the history of DU that eight colleges had demanded perfect scores for admissions. Last year, only Lady Shri Ram College had kept the cut-offs at 100 per cent for three courses -- BA (Honours) Political Science, BA (Honours) Psychology and BA (Honours) Economics. "

The ruling DMK government turned around the state BJP’s protest and said that they should rather protest against the Union government led by the BJP, which has issued an advisory against the religious gathering of people in view of the ongoing pandemic. The DMK government averted the demands being made by the protesting state BJP unit and quipped that they will agree on the demands made by BJP if they can obtain a circular from the central government permitting huge religious gatherings. They advised the state BJP unit to protest against the central government rather than protesting against the Tamil Nadu government.  Currently, temples are open for worship four days a week but closed for three days to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The state government had argued that an advisory was issued by the Home Ministry, on June 29 this year, which was later extended in view of the upcoming festive season. The advisory issued by the Centre had urged the state governments to restrict public observation of festivals like Muharram, Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja. It also advised the states to consider the imposition of local restrictions and prohibit people from gathering in large numbers.

Taliban has reportedly also asked America to not violate Afghanistan's airspace and refrain from interfering in their internal affairs. However, as per a statement by the Afghan Foreign Ministry, the US has pledged to provide Afghanistan with COVID-19  vaccines. According to reports, the Taliban described the talks as a push for a ""new page"" in relations between the two nations. A US delegation is set to travel to Doha to meet with senior Taliban representatives, more than a month after the extremist group reconquered Afghanistan. The US State Department announced on Saturday, October 9, about the first in-person meeting between the US and the Taliban after the crisis engulfed the South Asian country in the months after both sides reached a peace deal under the administration of former US President Donald Trump. US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that the main priorities of the meeting in Doha are to ensure the continuation of a secure passage of the people seeking to leave the conflict-stricken Afghanistan including Afghan nationals and foreigners. Price stated that the US side will also be pressing the Taliban to uphold the rights of women, form an inclusive government and allow the humanitarian agencies for free access to the vulnerable areas of need. During the Doha talks, US officials will also seek to hold the Taliban to commitments that they would allow Americans and other foreign nationals to leave Afghanistan, along with Afghans who once worked for the US military or government and other Afghan allies, a US official said. Taliban on Saturday ruled out cooperation with the United States to contain extremist groups in Afghanistan, staking out an uncompromising position on a key issue. Taliban political spokesman Suhail Shaheen told news agency AP that there would be no cooperation with Washington on going after the increasingly active Islamic State group affiliate in Afghanistan. IS has taken responsibility for a number of attacks, including a suicide bombing that killed 46 minority Shiite Muslims and wounded dozens as they prayed in a mosque."

The court directed CM Uddhav Thackeray-led government to grant pension to the 90-year-old freedom fighter under the 'Swatantrata Sainik Samman Pension Scheme, 1980'. A division bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar said the Maharashtra government should approach freedom fighters and their dependents to provide them with the grant of benefits of the scheme mentioned above rather than making such people file applications to proceed. The Bombay HC directed the Maharashtra government to start paying the 90-year-old widow freedom fighter under 'Swatantrata Sainik Samman Pension Scheme, 1980'.  Notably, the order was passed on a plea filed by Shalini Chavan, a resident of Raigad district, who sought the scheme's benefits and pleaded the sum be accorded to her, given her late husband Laxman Chavan was a freedom fighter. In previous hearings, the Bombay High Court had clarified that the available evidence in the case at hand did not dispute the status of Laxman Chavan being a freedom fighter and Shalini Chvana being his widow.  Meanwhile, the state government filed an affidavit to the plea claiming the petitioner was ineligible for pension as she had not submitted a mandatory original imprisonment certificate. The Maharashtra government further contended that Shalini Chavan's claim for pension was filed belatedly. However, the Bombay HC held there cannot exist rigidity in the time limit for making such applications and said, ""The prescription of a rigid time limit for the proof of entitlement in the very nature of things is demeaning. If the scheme for freedom fighters and their family was introduced with a genuine desire to assist and honour those who had given the best part of their life for the country, it ill behoves the government to raise a plea of limitation against such claims."" Furthermore, the bench noted that in instances where original documents are made available by the applicant, the state government should examine if the contention is genuine and if it has been established that the person had participated in a freedom movement. ""It should be done by applying the principle of probability,"" the bench said.  It is pertinent to note that the Bombay HC directed the member secretary of Raigad District Legal Services Authority to go to the petitioner's residence and assist her in collecting material documents. The Court also noted that Shalini Chavan has been pursuing her case since 1993 and she should be paid pension under the Scheme from October 2021. The bench has listed the matter for further hearing on January 6, 2022. The petitioner has sought an ex gratia sum of Rs 10 lakhs in the absence of a caregiver after her son's demise.  Notably, the plea states Laxman Chavan participated in the Quit India Movement in 1942 and was sentenced and jailed at Byculla Jail from April 17, 1944, to October 11, 1944. He died on March 12, 1965. "

The goal of this cycling rally is to convey the ""Swasth Bharat Abhiyan"" message. Lieutenant General Preet Mohindera Singh, Director General of TA, led the rally from India Gate. This rally emphasises the significance of healthy living and athletic activities, particularly in times of the global pandemic of Coronavirus. On Saturday, Union Minister Anurag Thakur donated blood at the Territorial Army base in Delhi on the celebration of the TA's 72nd Raising Day. At the camp, TA Director-General Lt Gen Preet Mohindera Singh also donated blood. Thakur had become the first serving Union minister to be appointed to Captain in the Territorial Army earlier in March. Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur participated in a blood donation event at the TA camp alongside Lieutenant General Preet Mohindera Singh. This was Thakur's first time as a TA Captain participating in a blood donation camp. Thakur was promoted to Captain in the Territorial Army's 124 Infantry Battalion (Sikh). Thakur was the Minister of State (MoS) for Finance and Corporate Affairs at the time of his promotion to Captain in the Territorial Army as a regular commissioned officer. In July 2016, he was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the TA. Thakur took to Twitter to share a video of the Territorial Army pipping ceremony, saying he was ""honoured"" to be promoted to Captain. Since its formation on October 9, 1948, as 'Citizens Army', the Territorial Army has played an important role in helping the Indian Army as the second line of defence in times of war. The Territorial Army has guarded vantage points, including key ammunition depots that require protection. The TA soldiers have always been recognised as multi-skilled and talented candidates, and their contributions have grown exponentially over time. Since India's independence, TA has taken part in every war in which the country has been involved. Because of their war skills, several TA Air Defence and Artillery units were later converted into regular army formations. "

As per PTI, Narinder Batra further stated that he will propose the name Ahmedabad's Motera Stadium as the venue for an opening ceremony. After it was rebuilt to make it the world's largest cricket stadium, the Motera facility was renamed as 'Narendra Modi Stadium' by the Gujarat Cricket Association in February 2021. The Narendra Modi Stadium, which can accommodate over 110,000 spectators (some accounts claim 132,000), was inaugurated by President Kovind, Home Minister Shah, Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju, Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat and other dignitaries ahead of the India-England pink-ball day-night test match in February 2021. ""If someone asks me about the venue for the opening ceremony at present, then it is definitely going to be the Motera stadium. There is no stadium better suited to host the opening ceremony of the Olympics (in India). I can't say what will happen by 2036.... (but) I will be proposing Ahmedabad as the venue for the opening ceremony,"" said Batra. Batra was speaking to the media at an event organized by TransStadia, a city-based sports infrastructure firm. Recently, the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) invited proposals from consultants to conduct a `gap analysis' to assess if the infrastructure in the city was adequate to host the Olympics. A proper presentation for India's bid will be prepared after a new president takes over following IOA elections in December, Batra said. India is one of the six or seven possible contenders for the 2036 games, added Batra.  The 2024 Summer Olympics edition will be held in Paris, France for a third time, exactly one hundred years after the city last hosted Summer Olympics in the year 1924. The IOC has also selected Los Angeles, California to host its third Summer Games in 2028, and Brisbane, Queensland, to host Australia’s third Olympics in 2032."

""In the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, a fair investigation is underway under retired High Court judge and some have been arrested and some have been called for questioning,"" Singh added.  Akhilesh Yadav on Friday had alleged that the state government is working only for powerful people and not for farmers. He had said, ""Whoever saw the video of the Lakhimpur incident has condemned the incident. This is a government that crushes the constitution. Everyone has seen everything, yet the guilty have not been caught. Every family I met said that the guilty should be punished.""

Before the killings, the protesters were seen holding black flags against Maurya's arrival at Maharaja Agrasen Ground. After the incident, farmers started stone-pelting at the car which had overturned, killing 4 people - including Misra's driver. The bodies of the four farmers were kept at the spot itself as farm leaders said that last rites will not be performed until their demands are met. Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM)  has demanded Union MOS Ajay Kumar Mishra's removal from his post immediately and his son should be booked for murder along with his supporters. However, Ashish Mishra has refuted those allegations and said that he was not present at the spot when the violence took place.

The chief executive of Britain’s biggest phone company, BT, proposed the “walk me home” service in a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel. As per the company, once a woman activates the app on her phone, the service would track her journey and send an alert to her emergency contacts if she didn’t reach her destination on time. As per reports, the “walk me home” service could be up and running by Christmas, in London.  On September 28, the British Police charged a man with the murder of London teacher Sabina Nessa, who was killed while she was on her way to meeting a friend in London. As per The Guardian, the police arrested 36-year-old Koci Selamaj early on September 26 in East Sussex, just after one week after the 28-year-old teacher's corpse was discovered. It is speculated that on Friday, September 17, Nessa had left her house in Kidbrooke, south-east London, at 8.30 pm. She was supposed to meet a friend at the Depot pub in Kidbrooke Village's Pegler Square, but she never showed up. Police officers were contacted just after 5.30 pm on September 18 when her body was discovered by a passerby near the One Space community facility in Cator Park, Kidbrooke Park Road, at a short distance from her house.  Earlier on July 9, Wayne Couzens, 48, pleaded guilty to murdering 33-year-old Sarah Everard after previously confessing to kidnapping and raping the woman who was just walking back to her home from a friend’s house in south London.

As per sources, during the investigation, it has come to light that on October 2, Arbaaz Merchant, Prateek Gaba and others first reached Shah Rukh Khan & Aryan Khan's Mannat Residence, and from there they had left together in a Mercedes car driven by Mishra for the Mumbai international cruise terminal where they were to board the Cordelia Cruise ship for Goa. However, they were arrested by the NCB before the cruise could depart. Mishra then purportedly returned to the Mannat Bungalow. NCB is recording Mishra's statement to confirm this sequence of events. Meanwhile, along with Shah Rukh Khan's driver, in another fresh summons by the NCB, film producer Imtiaz Khatri was produced before the NCB office after the agency raided Khatri's office and residence earlier in the day. Sources informed that the filmmaker and businessman Khatri left the premises after eight hours of interrogation by the premier agency. While Shah Rukh Khan's driver's interrogation is underway, the latest development in the drug bust case is the court's panchnama, which states that an NCB officer searched Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant at the cruise terminal on October 2. The pair were offered the option to be searched before a magistrate but declined. During the search, Arbaaz Merchant confessed that he had Charas hidden in his shoes, which he proceeded to remove and hand over to the NCB officer. The zip-lock bag with a black sticky substance was tested and confirmed to contain Charas. Arbaaz Merchant and Aryan Khan then each admitted to having consumed Charas and their intentions to consume the same onboard during the event.

Ironically, this means the Mumbai Police has sent a summons to its own former Commissioner, asking him to join the investigation on October 12. Param Bir is also being investigated by the Mumbai Police which is trying to determine how he empowered Sachin Vaze to an extent where he was effectively running the Crime Branch, despite the presence of more senior officers. A case of extortion was registered against the former top cop of Mumbai Param Bir Singh, his aide and sacked cop Sachin Vaze, and others, at the Goregaon police station. The Mumbai Crime Branch has pasted a notice outside Param Bir's residence, asking him to appear before it on Tuesday for questioning. The officer, who is currently the DG of the Maharashtra Home Guard but hasn't shown up to work for months, has also not appeared before any of the investigative agencies since June. He has been evading the summons issued by the Justice Chandiwal Commission, which is probing his allegations against Anil Deshmukh. This, despite multiple FIRs and arrest warrants piling up against him.  In September, Maharashtra Home Minister Dilip Walse Patil claimed that Param Bir Singh seems to have fled India to escape investigation. The state Home Minister also assured of action against Param Bir if such directions are issued by the Justice Chandiwal Panel, which is probing his case. Earlier this week, the Panel pulled up the former Mumbai CP and demanded to know how a man of his rank could disappear.  In April, Param Bir Singh in a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray alleged that then-Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had directed Sachin Vaze to extort Rs 100 crore from over 1,700 bars, restaurants, and establishments in Mumbai. While the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is investigating Param Bir's allegations against the NCP leader, the ex-CP himself has been accused in five extortion & corruption cases - including by two bookies who accused Param Bir of extorting and deceitfully charging them in betting cases.  Police Inspector Bhimrao Gadge also accused Param Bir Singh of interfering in a probe on collusion between builders and Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) officials to dupe the Maharashtra government of Rs 124 crore. The inspector also alleged that Param Bir had ordered him to remove the names of some municipal officials and builders from the chargesheet. On rejecting his demands, Gadge alleged that he was wrongfully imprisoned in a frivolous case till his acquittal by a court in September 2017."

Siddaramaiah said, ""I don't know, ask Kumaraswamy (JDS leader), but their intention is not good, because their intention is not to make minorities win. If they had the intention to ensure minorities win, they could have given tickets in other constituencies like Ramanagara, Hassan, Mandya (JDS stronghold)."" The Congress leader said that the regional party has no intention to work for the upliftment of the minorities and only wants to ensure victory in bye-polls by manipulating the minorities. He added, ""Whatever they (JDS) try to do, voters are intelligent and they cannot be underestimated.""

He said that the state government led by Chief Minister Bommai has only handed disappointment to the people. He said, ""People are fed-up of this BJP government with no development happening."" The bye-elections are being conducted after the seats fell vacant following the death of Sindagi JD(S) legislator M C Managuli and BJP's C M Udasi from Hangal. Siddaramaiah also made a statement saying that he will not leave state politics for national politics. Recently, he visited Congress President Sonia Gandhi to attend a personal meeting.

He added, ""After two days, there will be a complete blackout in the whole of Delhi if we do not receive more power supply from the Centre."" He further added that the only way to solve the power crisis is by purchasing expensive electricity. He said, ""The capacity of our hydroelectric plants has also reduced from 45,000 MW to 30,000 MW. But, we want the plants to generate 45,000 MW of electricity during this peak hour. We have also made power purchase agreements with NTPC of 35,000 MW-45,000 MW.

The actor has been in judicial custody since his arrest on August 29. As per the latest reports, his bail application will come up for hearing on October 13. Kohli's attempts to be released from custody had received a setback last month when his bail application was dismissed by a Mumbai court. He is currently lodged at the Arthur Road jail. The NCB had arrested the Jaani Dushman actor after conducting a raid at his residence in Mumbai. Arman Kohli had been arrested and charged under various sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS Act) for allegedly possessing drugs.  At that time, NCB Mumbai Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede had said, ""We cannot say much right now, all I can say is that he was searched under NDPS. After giving him summons, his questioning is still ongoing. His name is said to have emerged in the crackdown on drug peddlers in Mumbai. One of them reportedly had links with Bollywood after which Armaan Kohli came under the radar.  There has a spotlight on the Bollywood-drugs nexus in the wake of Sushant Singh Rajput's death last year. Not just were the accused in the actor's case arrested, most of who are on bail right now, there was spotlight on other members of the film industry too.  Many high-profile names had been questioned by the investigating agency over the past few months. Some were arrested too and are out of bail.

The Kashmiri Hindu Organization and several members of the Sikh community held protests at Delhi's Jantar Mantra on Saturday demanding justice for the Srinagar killings. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad also held protests in Jammu seeking action over the multiple deaths reported in the valley over the last week.  Fear grappled over Srinagar after the murders of four innocent civilians at the hands of terrorists. Makhan Lal Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit and the owner of a popular and old Srinagar pharmacy was shot dead by Pakistani-backed terrorists in J&K. Within a span of sixty minutes, terrorists shot dead a street vendor from Bihar's Bhagalpur, Virender Paswan. The terrorists then killed two teachers for having saluted India's Tricolour on August 15. In the fourth attack, a civilian identified as Mohd Shafi Lone, a resident of Naidkhai was shot at point-blank.  The Sikh community has demanded the J&K administration look into the matter seriously and provide them safe cover. Several government officials in the valley have called for a strike as part of their agitation.  The Gurudwara Praband Committee also expressed grief over the killing of the Sikh school principal and urged the administration to take measures for the security of the minorities. Addressing a press conference on Saturday, the Committee's Secretary Navtej Singh said that if killing minorities was the solution then it was better if they left Kashmir.  On Friday, Jammu Kashmir People's Forum came on the streets in large numbers demanding justice for the civilians who lost their lives and called for action against attackers. The enraged protestors slammed Pakistan for its state-sponsored terrorism in Kashmir.  On October 7, Union Home Minister Amit Shah called for a high-level security meeting to discuss the overall security situation with a prime focus on Jammu and Kashmir. The Home Minister was apprised by the security situation by security advisors including NSA Ajit Doval, BSF, CRPF heads, and Director of IB.

Although Axar succeeded in his attempt, he failed to stop RCB from winning the game as Maxwell's partner on the other side won the game for their team. In a video that is doing rounds on social media, Axar appears to be intentionally misfielding in order to keep Maxwell away from the strike. The video shows Axar deliberately slowing down while collecting the ball at mid-wicket, allowing Maxwell and Srikar Bharat to take two runs so the latter stays on strike for the final delivery of the innings.  However, to everyone's surprise, Bharat hits a last-ball six to help his side win the final match of the league stage. Needing 15 to win from the final over, Maxwell started it with a boundary but pacer Avesh Khan came back with a couple of excellent deliveries, including a yorker. A wide off the fifth delivery from Khan helped RCB's cause. Bharat smashed Khan's full toss over long-on for a six to seal the game in his team's favour.  Earlier, Maxwell was dropped twice off Axar Patel's bowling, which could easily be one of the reasons behind their defeat. While Maxwell hit an unbeaten 51 off 33 balls, Bharat smashed 78 off 52 balls to ensure his side finishes on the right side of the podium. Here is the video of the incident where Axar can be seen misfielding and then passing a smile to one of his teammates.  Earlier, RCB rallied to stop Delhi Capitals at 164 for five thanks to a spirited effort from the bowlers, especially Mohammed Siraj (2 for 25 in four overs). The table-toppers frittered away a strong 88-run opening partnership provided by Shikhar Dhawan (43) and Prithvi Shaw (48) with the other batsmen unable to build on it. As a result of the victory, RCB increased their points tally to 18 but failed to finish in the top two. Meanwhile, DC maintained their top spot in the IPL 2021 standing with 20 points."

Later in June 2020, Faesal along with PDP leaders Sartaj Madni and Peer Mansoor were released from detention. After his release, Faesal resigned from the post of chief of Jammu & Kashmir People's Movement (JKPM) which led to rumours that he was set to rejoin government service, amid what appeared to be a softening of position vis-a-vis the government.  During the high-level security meeting, Union Home Minister Amit Shah was apprised of the security situation by security advisors including NSA Ajit Doval, BSF & CRPF heads, and Director of IB. In the meeting that went on for over two-and-a-half hours, pertinent issues including anti-drone strategy, security concerns associated with Jammu and Kashmir, and the strategy to nab terrorists were discussed, sources said.

Speaking to the media on the unfortunate incident that has triggered widespread uproar in Uttar Pradesh, Tikait said there was no planning involved in the incident, therefore the killing of three BJP workers 'does not amount to murder.'  A violent clash broke out during farmers' protest in UP's Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 3 leading to the death of 8 persons including 3 BJP workers, 4 farmers and a journalist.  As per the FIR lodged by the UP police, three vehicles ferrying Union Minister Ajay Mishra's son Ashish and 15-20 unknown persons allegedly drove towards the protest site in Banbirpur village at high speed. The complainant alleged that Mishra, who was was sitting on the left seat of his Mahindra Thar vehicle, fired at protesters and began to mow down farmers. Claiming that two farmers succumbed to bullet injuries, the complainant added that Misra's three cars then drove at high speed through the protest which left many of them injured. After this, it is alleged Ashish Misra opened fire and fled the spot. However, the Union Minister and his son have denied these charges claiming that they were not present at the site. On Saturday, Ashish Mishra has been detained by the Uttar Pradesh Police after he was questioned in the case. The Supreme Court on Friday conducted a suo-moto hearing on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, during which Queen's Counsel Harish Salve, appearing on behalf of the UP government, denied claims of alleged firing at the farmers. Citing post mortem report of the deceased farmers, Salve said there were no gunshot wounds found on the victim's bodies. ""I was told that the post mortem did not show gun shot injury. They have found two cartridges, may be he had a bad aim and he missed it. But the manner in which car was driven, allegations are true. I am saying allegations are true and there is a 302 case. That is why a notice under Sections 160 of the CRPC was sent to Ashish Misra,"" the senior SC lawyer apprised the top court. The UP police lodged FIR lodged against Mishra and 15-20 unknown accused persons under IPC Sections 120B, 147, 148, 149, 279, 302, 304A and 338.

The state government has said that strict and sustained efforts will be made to protect the water resources in Tamil Nadu. The State Environment and Climate Change Minister Siva V Meyyanathan also said that the water samples have been collected to determine the level of contamination and take proper action. Over the past few months, the state government has initiated several programmes to reduce the level of pollution and contamination of several rivers across the state, including Cauvery. Before the elections, Chief Minister MK Stalin promised to take steps to ensure that the water in the rivers is clean. Stalin recently said, “The latest initiative is to constitute five panels comprising the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) on October 6 to monitor if untreated effluents from the dyeing units in Erode, Kumarapalayam, Pallipalayam, Karur and Tirupur were discharged into the Cauvery and its tributaries.” He also said that the committees have already begun the inspection and soon will come up with an action plan. Not just the officials from the special committees, engineers from the TNPCB and IIT-Madras have collected samples at various places from Mettur to Mayiladuthurai on October 9. The samples have been further sent for analysis as IIT-Madras suspects that the Cauvery river could be heavily polluted by pharmaceutically-active compounds, plastics, heavy metals and pesticides. The study performed by the TNPCB and IIT-M is a jointly funded programme by the Water Technology Initiatives of the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India and the UK Natural Environment Research Council. A previous study found out that the water contains contaminants, including personal care products, flame retardants, etc. “Efforts are on to obtain the advice of experts including those from IIT (M) to prevent the pollution of Cauvery river,” Meyyanathan said and added that based on their reports and guidance of the Chief Minister, steps will be taken to protect the water sources in the state."

Following the dismissal of Ishan Kishan, Mumbai Indians innings crumbled, however then Suryakumar Yadav's blitz pushed the Mumbai Indians total to 235 runs in 20 overs. Suryakumar Yadav scored a 40-ball 82 runs which were also registered as his highest individual total in the IPL, overtaking his best of 79 (not out) which he made last year (IPL 2020).

The party has also announced a series of Yatras concerning various sections of the society based on community, caste, and occupation. As of now, at least five Yatras are underway in the state. According to party sources, the Yatras are organised to sensitise various caste communities, farmers, and professionals against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and also understand their problems at the ground level.  On August 31, the lawyer wing of the party launched Samvidhan Bachao Sankalp Yatra that is aimed to cover the entire state in eight phases, highlighting the failures of the BJP on the law and order front. On the other hand, Janadesh Yatra will focus on the eastern part of the state raising issues related to Dalits and other backward communities.  Speaking at a press conference, Samajwadi Party President and Former UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in connection to the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, said, ""All those who have seen the video of the Lakhimpur incident have condemned it. Everyone has seen everything, yet the accused have not been caught yet."" He will embark on the 'Samajwadi Vijay Yatra' from October 12.  Earlier in August, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav had said that the party can win up to 400 seats in the upcoming elections given the anger and disappointment amongst the people with the BJP-led government. He further criticised the BJP government for failing to fulfill its promises. Yadav at a press conference had said, ""I used to say that we will win 350 seats in the 2022 Assembly elections. Seeing the anger of people against the incumbent BJP government for failing to fulfill the poll promises, we may win 400 seats."" In another update, the former CM had stated that the party is open for an alliance. He further said that the size of the alliance is not a matter of concern as they are ready to associate with small regional parties too. In a continued attempt towards forming an anti-BJP front, he is working towards uniting all parties to fight against one common foe. Uttar Pradesh is all set for the upcoming assembly elections in 2022. Other than Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, BSP will be contesting elections in Punjab with the Shiromani Akali Dal. Earlier during the 2017 UP Assembly elections, BSP had won 19 seats out of 403 seats. "

During the briefing, NCB Deputy Director-General Gyaneshwar Singh and Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede said that they were following an unbiased course of action and intercepted people based on arrests. The NCB also called allegations levelled by NCP leader Nawab Malik against the anti-drug agency baseless. ""Allegations made against NCB are frivolous. NCB's procedure is legally transparent and unbiased. All accused are treated equally,"" NCB said. ""A total of 9 independent witnesses were involved in the operation and Manish Bhanushali and KP Gosavi were among them. None of the independent witnesses including these two persons were known to NCB prior to this operation,"" Gyaneshwar Singh and Sameer Wankhede said. Earlier in the day, NCP leader Nawab Malik alleged that NCB allowed two people, including one with BJP links, to leave Cordelia cruise ship even as the raid was underway on October 3. Earlier, the Maharashtra Minister had also alleged that Aryan Khan's arrest was 'forgery'. ""For the last one month, the information was being circulated to crime reporters that the next target is actor Shah Rukh Khan,"" he said. He also alleged that person seen with Arbaaz Merchant was a BJP office-bearer. He showed a picture of Manish Bhanushali with PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. ""Bhanushali is the vice president of the BJP,"" Nawab Malik claimed He also questioned Wankhede's link with the person, KP Gosavi, whose selfie with SRK's son went viral."

Republic Media Network has accessed exclusive details of the NCB Panchanama on Saturday which has mentioned that during the search operations on October 3, Arbaaz A Merchant admitted that the quantity seized from his possession was going to be used for smoking by Aryan and him. After NCB confronted Aryan Khan based on Arbaaz's statement, he also admitted that the Charas was going to be consumed by the two of them onboard the Mumbai-Goa cruise ship.  The NCB Panchnama claims, ""IO Ashish Ranjan Prasad asked them that whether they accepted and then Arbaaz A Merchant said that he is having Charas hidden inside his shoes. The Charas in zip lock pouch was taken out from shoes voluntarily by Arbaaz A Merchant and was handed over to IO Ashish Ranjan Prasad. The zip lock pouch was having a black sticky substance. It was tested with DD Kit which was confirmed as Charas. Arbaaz A Merchant admits that he consume charas with Aryan Khan Shahrukh and they are going inside Cordelia cruise for a blast. On asking, Aryan Shahrukh Khan admit he also consume charas and the charas was meant for smoke during the cruise journey..."" (sic)  The latest revelation comes as a major clincher in the Mumbai cruise drugs bust. So far, Aryan Khan's counsel has asserted that the 23-year-old should be granted bail given that no narcotics were found on him. However, as per the claims in the NCB Panchanama, Aryan intended to smoke the Charas that was found on his friend Arbaaz A Merchant.  ""I thought that NCB and its law officers would know that no materials have been found with me nor in my bag and they let me go on the first day but they didn't,"" Aryan's advocate Satish Maeshinde had said in court. The lawyer, stressing for a bail had added, ""This interrogation, confrontation can take place even if I am out on bail."" Also during the course of the remand and bail hearings, Satish Maneshinde had told the court that while Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant were friends, Aryan did not know of Arbaaz's activities. ""I don't deny Aryan's friendship with Arbaaz but he is not connected with Arbaaz's activities,"" Maneshinde had said on October 7. At that hearing, Maneshine had asserted that Aryan Khan had arrived at the event aboard Cordelia Cruises ship upon the invite of a friend named Pratik Gawa. He argued that Aryan Khan saw Arbaaz Merchant standing at the entrance and 'walked along with him'.   Aryan Khan's bail was denied by the Killa Court on Friday which cited that his plea was 'not maintainable'. He is currently serving his 14-day judicial custody in Mumbai's Arthur Road jail. Two women accused-- Munmun Dhamecha and Nupur have been sent to Byculla jail while six men accused including SRK's son have been sent to the Arthur road until they receive bail from the Sessions court."

The chairman of India’s Reliance Industries Ltd entered the world’s most exclusive wealth group after the Reliance group’s stock climbed to a record on Friday. Ambani became the 11th person to enter the exclusive club. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Ambani's net worth has crossed the $100.6 billion mark.  According to international reports, Ambani’s wealth grew by $23.8 billion this year boosting him to reach the benchmark. Earlier in June, Ambani made an ambitious foray into the green energy market with a planned investment of about $10 billion over three years. The Reliance Jio Network founder has been an ever-growing presence in the Indian market since inheriting the oil-refining and petrochemicals businesses of his late father’s empire in 2005. A retail, technology and e-commerce titan, Ambani ventured into the telecommunications sector in 2016. His retail and technology ventures raised about $27 billion in 2020. Furthermore, Ambani’s ventures sold stakes to investors ranging from Facebook Inc. and Google to KKR & Co. and Silver Lake increasing the empire’s worth in the market. The chairman of India’s Reliance Industries Ltd has now entered the $100 billion wealth club alongside Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Adani Group founder Gautam Adani added $39.5 billion to his fortune this year showing promise to become the next entry to the club from India. The US-based convenience store 7-Eleven Inc (SEI) inked an agreement with Reliance Retail Ventures Limited on October 7 to launch its first store in India. This came days after retail giant Future Retail dropped its franchise agreement with 7-Eleven on a mutual basis. Issuing a statement, Reliance Retail Ventures Limited Director, Isha Ambani confirmed that the first 7-Eleven store will be opened in Andheri and will later roll out more such stores in other neighbourhoods and commercial areas of greater Mumbai. Furthermore, SEI's agreement with RRVL will look forward to implementing and localise its convenience retail business in India further bringing its process and practices in an expanded form. Earlier in September, Jio Network Chairman Mukesh Ambani welcomed the Central government’s telecom reforms and has called it a move towards strengthening India’s vision of becoming the world’s leading Digital Society. In a press statement, the Telecom Giant asserted that the notable reform measures will accelerate PM Modi’s vision of making India a Digital global power and will enable the citizens to access the internet with more ease.

A day after skipping the Uttar Pradesh Police's summons, Mishra appeared before the police at the Crime Branch today. As per sources, he is being questioned on various aspects such as his location at the time of the incident and whether he has any evidence to prove that he was not at the spot. According to Vadra, the state police wouldn't have initiated any steps if the Gandhi brother-sister duo hadn't met the kin of the victims.  The businessman also lashed out at UP CM Yogi Adityanath for his jibe at Priyanka Vadra sweeping the PAC guesthouse at Sitapur. Vadra opined, ""His mindset is wrong. All women are feeling insecure. If someone keeps their house clean, they are proud. The PAC guest house where she was held was very dirty. She swept the place and did nothing wrong. She kept the place hygienic. Wherever she goes, she will keep that place clean. Very soon, she will sweep away the UP government too"".  Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was detained in the early hours of October 4 by the police at Hargaon, as she proceeded towards Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the victims of the deceased farmers. In a video shared by Congress before her detention, Vadra was heard telling the police officials, ""If you forcibly take me in this van, you will be kidnapping me. Go and get a warrant before you arrest me. There may be no law and order in this state, but it is there in this country."" While sources stated that she was arrested under CrPC Section 151, the Congress general secretary cried foul over the fact that she hadn't been presented before a magistrate within 24 hours. Even as Gandhi was on the way to Lucknow on October 6, the state government changed its stance and allowed political parties to enter Lakhimpur in groups of 5 persons. Moreover, Vadra was released from the PAC guesthouse where she was detained for more than 50 hours. Subsequently, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, KC Venugopal, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi and Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel met the bereaved families. "

Robert Vadra, who made a public appearance after a break, took credit for action taken in the case. Union Minister Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra appeared before the UP SIT in connection with the Lakhimpur-Kheri incident on Saturday. Following the police questioning Ashish Mishra on his involvement in the incident, Robert Vadra claimed that it was his and his wife Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's efforts that made the UP police take action in the case. BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia slammed the Congress party and said that the leaders were doing ""political tourism"" in Uttar Pradesh. Reacting to the investigation being launched on Union Minister Ajay Mishra, Bhatia said, “law will take its own course. Culprits will be punished according to the law and they will have to face the consequences.” He further went on to allege that the Congress party was hiring workers from their Punjab and Chhattisgarh units to protest in UP as they didn’t have a base in the state. After being confronted by Republic TV, Ashish Mishra had broken his silence on the Lakhimpur-Kheri violence and had claimed that he was not present at the site of the incident. His statement came after a video of the Lakhimpur-Kheri violence was shared by opposition parties including Congress and AAP on social media. The 29-second video shows a car travelling at high speed mowing down farmers who are protesting. Moreover, Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) has claimed that one of the farmers was shot dead by Ashish Misra. An FIR has been filed against both Ajay Mishra and his son under Section 302.  Violence in Lakhimpur Kheri ensued when farmers began protesting against the Farm Laws outside an event venue where Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya was scheduled to attend on October 3. Claiming that Ashish Mishra shot down protestors and ran over them with his car, farmers resorted to stone-pelting and killed 4 BJP workers with lathis and swords. On October 3, while farmers were protesting against the three Farm Laws at Lakhimpur Kheri outside an event venue where Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya was scheduled to be present, one of the farmers was shot dead by Union MoS Ajay Mishra Teni's son Ashish Mishra and two farmers were killed after his car ran over them. Before the killings, the protesters were seen holding black flags against Maurya's arrival at Maharaja Agrasen Ground. After the incident, farmers started stone-pelting at the car which had overturned, killing 4 people - including Mishra's driver. The bodies of the four farmers were kept at the spot itself as farm leaders said that last rites will not be performed until their demands are met. Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM)  has demanded Union MOS Ajay Kumar Mishra's removal from his post immediately and his son should be booked for murder along with his supporters. "

When Perry took the field against India Women for the second of three T20I games, she surpassed Alex Blackwell to become Australia's most-capped female cricketer with 252 caps. Perry has now played more games than any other female cricketer in the Australian squad, including their captain Meg Lanning, who has 205 caps to her name. The feat becomes even more remarkable given she is only 30 and has still got many more years to play.  Perry made her cricketing debut for the Australian national women's team at the age of 16 in 2007; and to date, she remains the youngest Australian to play international cricket. Perry is also the only cricketer in the world — male and female included, to have played in both the cricket and football world cups for her country. In 2014, the 30-year-old eventually settled on playing cricket professionally and has since remained a regular fixture in the Australian squad.  Perry was a part of the group of first women cricketers to be handed Cricket Australia's central contracts in 2008 and that further cemented her place in the national squad. Perry had started in the Australian squad as a fast bowler, however, she gradually came to be known as an all-rounder after putting on some amazing performances with the bat as well. Perry rose to fame in 2008 when she helped her side win a T20I match against England on debut with her unbeaten 29 runs and a four-wicket haul. She was handed the Test cap the same year as she made her debut against England.  Since her entry into the international arena, Perry has never looked back and continues to pile up records after records to make herself count among the greatest of all time. Recently, Perry became the first female player to register the double of 300 wickets and 5,000 runs in international cricket. In her 14-year-long career, Perry has earned 9 Test caps, 118 ODI caps, and a whopping 124 T20I caps, which is most by an Australian female cricketer. "

Fifty-four-year-old David Adler Staveley, a resident of Andover in Massachusetts, faked his death to avoid arrest after he attempted to scam the government of $543,000 in COVID relief funds, prosecutors were quoted as saying by USA Today. According to the US Attorney's Office for the District of Rhode Island, Staveley was first detained in May 2020 after prosecutors accused him of filing four fake CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program forgivable loan applications with an associate called David Butziger. However, Staveley removed a home monitoring device three weeks after his detention and escaped. He then travelled to several states using false identities and stolen licence plates. After the US Marshals initiated a fugitive investigation, he was finally apprehended in Georgia in late July 2020, USA Today reported.  Staveley and his partner, Butziger, claimed to employ scores of people at four distinct enterprises, however, prosecutors stated they did not own the businesses and had no staff working for them. They went on to say that the accused applied for funding shortly after the small business loan programme was announced. Notably, Staveley was the first person in the country to be charged with attempting to cheat the SBA Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act. According to officials, no money was released to them.  Meanwhile, both the accused and his mother pleaded with the judge for mercy, stating that Staveley is suffering from chronic PTSD as a result of being abused during a previous time in federal prison. His attorney contended that Staveley had been in self-isolation for 14 months, as he has previously spent a couple of years in federal prison in New Hampshire for stealing $284,000 from a small league baseball team and committing mortgage fraud. It should be mentioned here that the Paycheck Protection Program was launched to help small businesses that suffered due to the coronavirus pandemic, with forgivable loans. According to a survey from the University of Texas at Austin, there are more than 1.8 million loans worth $76 billion with potential fraud by borrowers. "

As per Congress general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal, the CWC members will commence their deliberations at 10 am and discuss the current political situation and the Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab and Manipur. Most importantly, organisational elections shall also come up for discussion during the CWC meeting. This implies that the schedule for electing a new Congress president might be finalised.  After being at the helm of affairs for 19 years which witnessed the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance emerging victorious in 2004 as well as the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Sonia Gandhi had paved the way for her son Rahul's elevation as the party president in December 2017. Following a series of defeats in state elections combined with the disastrous performance of Congress in the 2019 General elections, Rahul Gandhi announced his decision to step down. Sonia Gandhi has been holding interim charge of Congress since August 2019 after attempts to persuade the Wayanad MP to take back his resignation failed. In a letter addressed to Sonia Gandhi on August 23, 2020, 23 senior party leaders had observed that the uncertainly over the leadership and the drift in the party have weakened Congress and demoralized the workers. The letter mentioned many suggestions such as the need for a full-time leadership available at the national and state headquarters and conducting elections at all levels including the Congress Working Committee. Despite the high-octane drama at the CWC meeting held thereafter, it was decided that the Rae Bareli MP will continue as the interim president at least until the next AICC session is convened. Far from addressing concerns, the CWC on January 22 stated that the election to the post of party president will be held only after the conclusion of the Assembly polls in Assam, Puducherry, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. When the party's apex decision-making body met on May 10, the CWC delayed the process for electing a new party supremo indefinitely amid the COVID-19 crisis. The resolution mentioned that given the “nationwide emergent conditions prevailing on account of unprecedented Corona pandemic”, the party must channelize all its energies towards relief measures and “defer the elections temporarily”."

He said, “We are delighted with UK-India cooperation on Covishield, those travelling from India can now enter the UK without quarantine.” He further added, “The people are desperate to come here. Our next step is to ease the way for travellers to come here, opening up more flights so we can get people moving between UK and India.” Earlier this week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson lifted the travel restrictions imposed on Indian travellers and reversed the decision of compulsory quarantine for fully vaccinated Indians. The UK government has allowed Indian travellers to visit the UK from October 11, 4 am onwards and will no longer have to quarantine for ten days. The UK government further announced that the fully vaccinated individuals inoculated with the Covishield vaccine will be treated the same as the returning fully vaccinated UK residents. Along with India, the British government removed over 37 countries from the travelling red list. Fully vaccinated people from over 37 new countries and territories like Brazil, Ghana, Hong Kong, and Pakistan will be allowed to travel. MP Rt Hon Grant Shapps announced the decision on Twitter that only seven countries are on the red list as of now. Although, the rule states that the traveller must not have visited a red-listed country or territory in the ten days before arriving in England. He also announced that fully vaccinated passengers from 37 countries, including India, Turkey and Ghana, will be treated as citizens vaccinated in the UK. He posted, ""I'm also making changes so travellers visiting England have fewer entry requirements, by recognising those with fully-vax status from 37 new countries and territories including India, Turkey and Ghana, treating them the same as the UK fully vax passengers."" The UK government made a statement saying that the policy was altered to allow the travel and tourism industry to flourish. The reversal of the decision came after several talks between India and the UK about the latter's travel policy discriminating against vaccinated Indians."

Ronaldo's transfer was one for the ages, with initial reports suggesting that he could join United's cross-town rivals Manchester City but then made a u-turn and decided to return to Old Trafford. Since putting on the Red Devils' jersey again the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has been nothing short of prolific. He has managed to rack up five goals in seven appearances so far, with three of them coming in the Premier League. His goalscoring prowess has now earned him the Premier League Player of the Month award. Ronaldo took to Twitter to express his gratitude for being elected Player of the Month in the league, he thanked his teammates saying that he could not have done it without them. The Portuguese superstar won the Premier League Player of the Month award after receiving more votes than the other nominees. The other players that were also nominated for the award were Manchester City's Joao Cancelo, Chelsea's Antonio Rudiger, Newcastle United's Allan Saint-Maximin, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, and Watford's Ismaila Sarr. Ronaldo's return to Old Trafford could not have been better; he started in United's league game against Newcastle and managed to score a brace as the Red Devils thrashed Newcastle 4-1. He then scored again in United's win over West Ham before scoring two more in two UEFA Champions League games, including a dramatic injury-time winner against Villareal after they were down a goal only to make a comeback. However, not everything has been goals and wins for the five-time Ballon d'Or winner as he was recently benched for United's 1-1 draw against Everton in the league, and he was not happy with the decision to start from the bench. United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has defended his team selection and went to say that not starting Ronaldo was the 'correct decision', explaining that Edison Cavani needed the playing time. However, Ronaldo would not want to be on the bench too often because of his relentless attitude to play every minute of every game and win all of them."

The racing icon is currently participating in the Turkish Grand Prix 2021. ""I try not to be someone who just talks a lot. I want to act and drive positive developments. But I'm not Superman. I can't save the world on my own"", the reigning F1 world champion added. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton will take a 10-place grid penalty at Sunday's Turkish Grand Prix after he took on the fourth engine, one more than what is allowed in a season. The Brit will avoid starting the race from the back of the grid as he is only changing his internal combustion engine (ICE) and not his complete power unit. As things stand in the Drivers Championship, Hamilton (246.5) currently leads Verstappen (244.5) by two points. The Brit won last weekend's race in Russia, while the Dutchman successfully finished in second place after starting from the back of the grid due to an engine penalty. Hamilton will hope that he can achieve a similar result after opting to take up a new engine. Lewis Hamilton has been dominating the Formula 1 circuit for a long time and has won four consecutive titles between 2017 to 2020 and when he won the F1 Championship last year, the Mercedes icon ended up equaling the legendary Michael Schumacher's record of seven drivers' titles. In the 2021 season, Lewis Hamilton looks forward to continuing his splendid run to win a fifth consecutive as well as eighth F1 Championship but more importantly, he would end up surpassing Schumacher in case he succeeds in bagging yet another world title."

By registering on this portal, workers of the unorganized sector will be able to get the benefits of government schemes easily and conveniently.""

In the meeting, several crucial decisions were taken.

Fonte, while speaking to talkSPORT, said they always look at what Ronaldo is eating to keep himself healthy and fit so they could follow the same process and try and replicate that on the field. Fonte further revealed what Ronaldo eats when he is training with the team. Fonte said Ronaldo likes eating healthy stuff, including eggs, sweet potatoes, broccoli, and quinoas. Fonte added that Ronaldo does eat some fried and unhealthy food occasionally, especially fried eggs, and steak with fries. ""As a rule, he eats nice and clean, you know the nice quinoas and all this healthy stuff. A lot of eggs, sweet potatoes, the broccoli, he's into that. I've seen him eating a little bit of everything,"" Fonte was quoted by the sports radio station.  Earlier, Manchester United goalkeeper Lee Grant had said that players at the club copy Ronaldo's eating habits in order to keep themselves as fit as the legendary footballer. Grant also revealed that the rest of the teammates are sometimes too scared to eat dessert in front of Ronaldo because he has the most ""cleanest plate"" one can imagine. Grant said that players look up to Ronaldo and strive to emulate his lifestyle by avoiding junk food. According to Grant, the entire squad was having dinner together at the team hotel the day before Ronaldo's first match, and players simply refused to eat brownie and custard after seeing the Portuguese attacker's plate filled with healthy food. Ronaldo had a great start to his second spell at United as the Portuguese superstar's stellar performance saw him win the award ahead of Manchester City's Joao Cancelo, Chelsea's Antonio Rudiger, Newcastle United's Allan Saint-Maximin, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, and Watford's Ismaila Sarr. Ronaldo scored a brace (two goals in one match) in his very first game for United since the reunion in September.

The group of people apprised the Haryana Chief Minister concerning problems faced due to the blockades. A memorandum was also given to Chief Minister Khattar demanding the reopening of the roads at the earliest. Talking to the reporters, CM Manohar Lal Khattar said, ""A delegation of people from villages around the Singhu border of Sonipat dist came to meet me and demanded the road to the Singhu border be opened. The Supreme Court has also taken cognizance of it and we're hopeful that the problem will be solved soon"".  He added that the state government is trying its best to reopen the roads while maintaining law and order. He expressed his concerns over the losses being caused to traders and shopkeepers due to the closure of roads. Khattar assured villagers that the issue will be resolved, as some of the people informed him about their tough times stating they are on verge of closing businesses.  Farmers protesting the Centre's three farm laws have been squatting for over 10 months along the Kundli-Singhu border forcing business of shopkeepers and showroom owners near the Singhu and Tikri borders to come to a standstill. Some regions have been affected in a way that people have been forced to migrate. The villagers have demanded police patrol as it has become very difficult for locals to commute during night hours.  The closure of roads has forced children from not going to school and their education future has been affected, according to locals. Some patients also reportedly lost their lives as they weren't able to reach the hospitals on time.  On Monday, a Supreme Court bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud refused to entertain Sonipat residents' plea in connection to the protests against the farm laws. Advocate Abhimanyu Bhandari, appearing for the petitioners, stated that the farmers' protest at the Singhu border is disturbing people's right to movement. However, Justice Chandrachud observed, ""Why don't you approach the High Court being resident of Sonepat? Why are these petitions filed here for publicity? There is no need for us to intervene when high courts are well versed with the local conditions and what is happening. We should trust HCs."""

Kushinagar is an important Buddhist pilgrimage site, where Gautama Buddha accomplished Mahaparinirvana. It is considered a very sacred Buddhist pilgrimage centre where Buddhists pilgrim from all over the world come for a pilgrimage. Kushinagar is dotted with several other Buddhist sites in the nearby surroundings like Sravasti (238 km), Kapilvastu (190 km) and Lumbini (195 km) that makes it an attraction for both followers and visitors alike. Kushinagar already serves as the presenting site for Buddhist circuit pilgrimage spanning across India and Nepal.  During his September visit, the Prime Minister had laid the foundation stone of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh University in Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh. He had hailed UP CM Yogi Adityanath while describing his governance as 'double-engine government' for swift development. PM had further revealed that more than half a dozen companies related to defence production in Aligarh were going to create thousands of new jobs with an investment worth hundreds of crores. In his concluding remarks, he said that the state was turning into a very attractive place for every small and big investor of the country and the world."

""We have no intention to remain (in Mali) and that's why we are closing the bases,"" Macron straightforwardly said. ""Our work in Tessalit or Kidal (northern Mali) is not aimed at retaining bases,"" he stated. However, complete military withdrawal would require a ""strong state in Mali"" and ""significant investment projects in this country,"" he noted. The declaration reaffirms the President's assertions made during the summit with leaders of the G5 Sahel countries at Elysee presidential palace in Paris held on July 9, 2021, where he claimed to revoke 2,000 French troops by the end of the year. Although, actions on the same are yet to be carried out. The statement regarding military withdrawal from Mali comes days after the Malian Foreign Ministry expressed displeasure over Macron's 'unfriendly' remarks. Fresh tensions erupted between Mali and France after Foreign Minister, Abdoulaye Diop, summoned France's ambassador to express disappointment over Macron's statement made on October 5.  According to a report published by Sputnik, on Tuesday, Macron said that terrorists based in the Sahel region 'did not seize power in Mali due to the presence of the French Army,' which sparked disputes between the two countries. Mali's foreign affairs ministry issued a statement expressing 'outrage and condemnation' and saying these types of remarks may harm the development of friendly relations between both sides. The displeasure was followed by Malian Prime Minister Choguel Kokalla Maiga's accusation of Paris abandoning FAMa in the joint operation against Islamist terrorists. The relations between Mali and France began to deteriorate after the latter reduced influence in the region under Barkhane's operation. France had also warned Mali of withdrawing its troops completely from the country if the Mali Junta deployed Russian forces. Such conflicts have led to violent armed uprisings in the Sahel region that have further pushed Mali's into fragile economic, social and political conditions into more critical challenges like deaths, displacement of citizens and growing poverty rate."

List of 5 potential candidates https://t.co/h1tM6Pqutb,https://www.republicworld.com/sports-news/football-news/who-will-replace-steve-bruce-as-newcastle-manager-list-of-5-potential-candidates.html,0.0,13.0,Who Will Replace Steve Bruce As Newcastle Manager? List Of 5 Potential Candidates,"Newcastle United on Thursday changed hands following a massive £300 million Saudi-backed deal, which has now made the club the richest in the world. Ever since the deal has been made public, speculations around Newcastle's manager Steve Bruce's future at the club have started doing rounds. It is highly likely that the new owners will look for a change in the leadership of the club since Newcastle can now afford to employ bests in the business. Here's a list of five potential contenders in the race to replace Bruce as Newcastle boss.  The former English footballer, who is currently out of job, is the favourite to replace Bruce as Newcastle's new manager. Howe last managed the second-tier English League side AFC Bournemouth and also helped the side progress to the first division. Howe has a lot of experience as a manager of a Premier League side and is also known for his masterful tactics. He is known for winning games for his side without any big stars.    The former Italian footballer is another individual on the list with no job in hand at the moment. Conte last managed Serie A side Inter Milan and helped the team win the title in his second and final season. Conte also has the experience of managing a Premier League side as he was the boss at Chelsea for two years between 2016 and 2018. Under Conte, Chelsea managed to win two titles - Premier League (2017) and FA Cup (2018).  The retired English player, who is currently managing Scottish Premiership club Rangers, is also in line to be appointed the new in-charge of the Magpies, according to reports. Gerrard has zero experience of managing a Premier League club apart from that one season when he managed the U-18 team of Liverpool at the side's Youth Academy. However, the 41-year-old has proved his worth in the Scottish league, where he helped Rangers lift the title for the first time in 10 years.   Martinez has not managed a club since he left Everton in 2016 to join the Belgium national side. During his final year at Everton, Martinez helped the side reach the semi-finals of both domestic cups, however, he was sacked after fans protested against him and the management. Martinez has since had a successful stint with Belgium. He had helped Belgium finish third at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.  Lampard is one of the top contenders to replace Bruce as Newcastle's manager. He has the experience of leading a Premier League side as he was the manager at Chelsea for two years between 2019 and 2021. During his time at Chelsea, Lampard helped the side finish in the top-4 of the league's table. However, following a poor season last year, Lampard was sacked by the club. "

The series of programmes were part of a United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) outreach initiative to encourage community interaction.  In a statement, UNAMA said that during the radio shows held across Panjshir, Parwan, and Kapisa provinces, speakers from religious organisations, civil society, women councils, academics, as well as youth groups highlighted the fact that there is no justification for violence, armed war, or loss of life. They claimed that peace negotiations should be the central focus for the well-being of all Afghans.  Shayesta Mehraban, a rights activist in Panjshir stated that women and youth are the biggest victims of the conflict in Afghanistan and must oppose wars. She went on to say that the younger generation must persuade one another that violence is not the answer since all are suffering and dying as a result of it. The conflict will certainly end if the youth cease fighting, she added.  While, Najibullah Rahimi, a former member of the Kapisa Provincial Council, spoke at one of the radio shows that war is strongly discouraged by the Sharia and international rules as it is killing several people, demolishing houses and public infrastructure. Citing Rahimi said, “It is the religious and moral responsibility of every Afghan to play their role in stopping the war because war cannot be won with war, it must end, Afghans are no longer able to tolerate it.""  Another speaker, Shamela Begi, emphasised the need for tolerance and respect for one another's viewpoints in resolving disagreements via reason and nonviolent methods. She added that Afghans should intensify efforts to build peace and stop the conflict by battling all ethnic, religious, and regional divisions.  Roya Sabet, a women's rights activist from Parwan stated that war has catastrophic repercussions on the individual, family, and societal lives, notably more painful for women. To achieve a prosperous and successful Afghanistan, Roya Sabet urged the warring parties to stop killing, avoid civilian fatalities, and terminate the conflict.   Furthermore, a religious scholar in Panjshir, Maulavi Ahmadullah Hasheminajad stated that if fighting could provide progress and prosperity, then Afghans would have been the most affluent existence in the world. “But unfortunately, because of the longstanding conflict we are staying behind. Peace is the guarantor of any progress,"" stressed Hashminajad, ANI reported.   Radio Kechken in Panjshir, Radio Dunya Naween in Parwan, and Radio Sada-e-Nijrab in Kapisa organised and broadcast the UNAMA-sponsored radio programs. UNAMA collaborates with a variety of organisations and people, which comprise local leaders, youth groups, women, and local media stations, to develop opportunities for Afghans to engage in conversation on important problems impacting their neighbourhoods via radio, social media, and television.

He has not had the greatest of starts after only one goal involvement for PSG in five appearances. People have begun to question whether it was the right move for Messi to join PSG but the Argentine superstar has revealed that he is ""very happy today"" at the club. Speaking to France Football's L'Équipe, the 34-year-old said, Messi then revealed that he received many offers after his Barcelona exit was confirmed but he and his team came to an agreement with PSG very quickly. He said that it was PSG's project, the players and the overall quality of the team that won him over. Currently, there are three Argentine players at PSG, Angel di Maria, Leandro Paredes, and Mauro Icardi, there is also Messi's very close friend Neymar. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner said that having these friends in the dressing room allowed him to settle quickly especially because many PSG players speak Spanish as he does. The Argentine superstar made his debut as a second-half substitute against Reims on August 29. Following that he was handed his first start for PSG in their Champions League trip to Brugge on September 15. He then started that match against Lyon but was subbed off after 76 minutes, a decision he reacted angrily to by refusing to shake the hand of manager Mauricio Pochettino. He was unable to get on the scoresheet in his first three games for the Parisians. And with no goals or assists, it left everyone wondering whether this was the right move for the 34-year-old. Following the Lyon game, Messi spent the next two matches against Metz and Montpellier on the sideline owing to a knee injury. But there is only so much the record-breaking Lionel Messi can go without seeing his name on the scoresheet. PSG took on Manchester City in the Champions League and Messi scored. In the 74th minute of the Group A match against City, Kylian Mbappe set up Messi for the perfect shot, and the six-time Ballon d'Or winner obliged as he scored a wonderful curler past a helpless Ederson. That was PSG's second goal of the night and the match ended 2-0 with a victory for the Parisians over City."

The North African country has been shadowed by an excruciating migrant crisis pertaining to its geopolitical location. While Libya itself does not offer great employment opportunities, it acts as a transit for hundreds of thousands of Africans travelling to Europe for a 'better future.'  The humanitarian organisation pointed out that Libyan authorities have conducted multiple raids in the past week, particularly targeting refugees and migrants. Buttressing its stance further, UNHCR said that at least one person was killed and 15 others injured in recent raids. In addendum, it highlighted that more than 5,000 refugees have been arrested by Libyan authorities as of now. Concluding its statement, UNHCR called on the Libyan administration to resume humanitarian flights that have been suspended for a year now.  The number of people arrested in detention centres in Tripoli, Libya, has tripled in the previous five days, after at least 5,000 migrants and refugees were detained amid violent mass arrests across the city since October 1, according to Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). MSF provides medical services in three Tripoli detention institutions and has seen numerous detainees confined in overcrowded and unclean conditions with insufficient food, water, shelter, or medical care.  Many of those detained have already spent years in custody after fleeing conflicts or dictatorships across Africa. The EU-backed Libyan coastguard intercepted them as they attempted to reach Europe via sea. The arrests, according to Libyan police, are linked to illegal immigration and narcotics trafficking."

Here's Everything We Know So Far,"There seems to be no ending to Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving's problem in the buildup to the NBA season with the star likely to miss the home game due to COVID-19 protocol. The point guard has earlier missed the practice session due to New York City's COVID-19 vaccination protocols, however, the recent report by ESPN suggests that Kyrie Irving will be allowed to practice at the team's facility in New York City, but still won't be able to play in Nets' home games at Barclays Center according to a City Hall official. The Brooklyn Nets defeated defending NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks 119-115 in their first NBA preseason game without Kyrie Irving in the lineup. The point guard missed the game after failing to meet COVID-19 vaccinations regulations for athletes who play in or practice in the city of New York. As per the report, City Hall official stated that the HSS Training Center — the Nets' practice facility in Brooklyn — is considered a private workplace, so it's not subject to New York City's vaccination mandate. While Kyrie Irving's vaccine status is still unclear the seven-time All-Star was listed on the team's injury report as ineligible to play in the Nets' home preseason game against Bucks. It's unclear whether Kyrie Irving will be allowed to play in away games. According to National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts, more than 90 per cent of the players are fully vaccinated ahead of the upcoming season, which is more than the national average of 55 per cent. As per the NBA vaccine mandates set by New York City and San Francisco could prohibit players of the Brooklyn Nets, New York Knicks and Golden State Warriors from competing in home games if they are not vaccinated or exempted. Players who are yet to receive COVID-19 vaccination or have refused to take one ahead of the upcoming 2021-22 season will be required to follow many of the same restrictions that were imposed during the previous edition of the competition. The players who have refused to take vaccines will have to undergo daily testing otherwise they will not be allowed to enter training facilities and mingle with other members of their team. Unvaccinated players must also undergo lab-based testing ahead of their match as they did in the previous edition. Unvaccinated players are also not allowed to enter dining room areas and eat with fully vaccinated members of the team. They will be required to stay 6 feet apart from fully vaccinated personnel and will also have to wear face masks all the time. "

Alleging that BJP was misusing state machinery to turn the tide in its favour, she also warned that the saffron party might accrue political advantage by communalising the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. She added, ""All farmers of the country are holding an agitation against the Centre's three farm laws. Now, the protesting farmers are being heavily exploited. The incident in Lakhimpur-Kheri is a prime example of this"". She stated, ""Along with BJP, SP and Congress, AAP, Owaisi's party, Shiv Sena and other parties are making a number of promises to win votes. There is no substance in them. The people of the state should not fall into the trap of the tempting promises which are going to be made by the opposition parties in their election manifestos. After coming to power, the majority of these promises are not implemented."" On this occasion, Mayawati also outlined BSP's roadmap for the state and promised to continue implementing the schemes started by the BJP and SP governments which are in ""public interest"". She stressed, ""After forming the government, our party will focus primarily on making available employment opportunities for the poor and unemployed youth. So that, they don't have to migrate from UP henceforth for the purpose of employment. This will be our main poll plank"". She noted that BSP would concentrate on improving the existing hospitals, colleges, roads and bridges before embarking on new projects. Mayawati also promised to ensure the safety of the Brahmin community and the upliftment of Muslims. Compared to BJP (312) and the SP-Congress alliance (54), BSP could win only 19 seats in the 2017 UP Assembly polls. "

I am really happy to say that the ICG is addressing all these challenges successfully.” Singh also said that the ICG and the Indian government have the same goal of promoting regional cooperation, maintaining peace in the Indian Ocean region and working with international maritime agencies."

When asked if the US President might seek to end marking Columbus Day as a federal holiday, Psaki replied saying that she doesn’t have any predictions at this point. “Well, today is both Columbus Day, as of now ... as well as Indigenous Peoples' Day,"" Psaki said."

A couple of days ago, Murray had taken to his official Instagram account and revealed that his wedding ring has been stolen along with his shoes for the tournament. Murray married his wife Kim Sears in 2015 and since then has played with the wedding ring tied to one of the laces. He did the same while taking part in a practice session before the tournament opener of the Indian Wells tournament against Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. Lately, the two-time Olympic gold medalist had posted an image on Instagram after he was reunited with his tennis shoe as well as his wedding ring. Nonetheless, his facial expression is what stood out the most as he could not tolerate the odour of his shoe. Along with the post, the British tennis player also posted a video where he is informing everyone that he has found his lost belongings back.  Earlier, the double Olympic gold medalist had to appeal on his social media account for the return of his wedding ring. Murray said that he left his shoes under his car so that they would get dry but they were stolen by the next morning. It was later that he realised that he had not only lost the shoes, but he had also forgotten to remove the ring from the shoes. ""Last night after dinner in Indian Wells, I got back in the car to go back to the hotel and the car didn't smell great. Basically, I'd left my tennis shoes in there. . It's been 39 degrees so my tennis shoes are pretty damp, sweaty. So, I decided when I got back to the hotel that the shoes needed some air, I needed to dry them out a little bit. I have no balcony in my room and I didn't want to leave them in my room as it would stink the room out. So, I thought I'm going to leave the shoes underneath the car, to get some air to them and dry them out overnight,"" said Andy Murray while sharing his grievances with the public. He added, “Anyway when I got back to the car in the morning, the shoes were gone. So, my tennis shoes for the tournament had been stolen, so I had to go to the local pro shop and buy different shoes, different brand, which isn't the end of the world, but obviously not ideal. But as I was preparing for my practice, my physio said to me, 'Where's your wedding ring?'” The former world number one further added, “So, if anyone could share this, or have any clue where they may be, it would be very helpful, so if we can try and get them back and get to the bottom of it, it would be much appreciated."""

The new feature will allow users to tune a guitar using the device's microphone just like any other guitar app available on the Google Play Store or Apple's app stores. The feature was made available on October 7 and can be accessed by updating the browser on the phone or computer that has a microphone. The feature was first spotted by Andriod Police. Go to the Google search bar and simply type 'Google Tuner' to use the feature. To enable this feature, Google needs permission to use the device's microphone. Though the feature works well on most devices, the quality of the microphone on your mobile phone or computer influences the output from the instrument tuner.  The Google Tuner functions like a physical tuner and when the user plays a string on the guitar, the tuner immediately captures the note and displays recommended notes for playing.  According to last month's release, Google introduced some features to the platform, a stable update to Chrome 94, including new security features, and bug fixes for Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows operating systems. Also, some of the other features like environment-friendly routing, light navigation for cyclists, and sharing og Google Maps information related to the capabilities of bikes and scooters to reduce carbon emissions.  In addition, a new search filter with Gmail and Andriod has been introduced by Google to allow users to quickly and easily filter email search results on their phones. In the Gmail app, the search filter appears right below the search box whereby entering a specific name or time desired email will be filtered. Also, a new setting has been added for the Google app on Andriod to allow users to choose whether they want personalised search results. In another update, Google announced that it will update its ads and monetisation policies on climate change. According to the updated policy, the company will not post ads with wrong information or content concerning climate change on the Google Search Engine or on YouTube. Some of the content that wouldn't be considered for monetisation includes content claiming climate change as false, statements that deny global warming, and further deny greenhouse has emissions or human activity is responsible for climate change.

The meeting comes ahead of the key 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue scheduled for later this year. At the 16th US-India Defense Policy Group meeting, US and Indian officials exchanged their views on regional issues of shared interest in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region, PTI reported, citing a statement by US Defence spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Anton T Semelroth. Additionally, they discussed advancement on 'enhanced cooperation' with 'like-minded' partners to sustain a free and open Indo-Pacific. As India and the US opened a 'new chapter' in the major defence partnership, both the countries have aimed to expand on the set of bilateral priorities, including information-sharing, high-end maritime cooperation, logistics, and defence trade. According to Pentagon, the comprehensive discussion on the aforementioned topics will take place in November's 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue announced by Foreign Secretary Harsh V Shringla last month. The meetings come amid China's escalated aggression to claim sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. Although, Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia have stood against it. Meanwhile, the Quad Leaders have repeatedly urged for a ""free, open and inclusive"" Indo-Pacific region, sending an apparent message to China. While addressing a special session of the India-Ideas Summit, US Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman, on Thursday, expressed her views on the importance of a “free, open, and inclusive” Indo-Pacific region. In a step forward to deepen bilateral collaboration in trade and investment, she also reaffirmed the US's commitment to implement positive and constructive initiatives of the Quad as announced at the recently held leaders’ Summit."

Republic TV has accessed inside details of Mishra's questioning which suggest that the leader was grilled on his location during the time of the violence which left 8 people dead.  As per sources, the police has quizzed Ashish Mishra on his location on October 3 and whether he has any evidence to prove that he was not at the spot when his vehicle mowed down farmers. He has been asked questions like - 'How true are the allegations against you' and 'Where were you during the time of the incident', which special mention to his location.  Ashish Mishra, who evaded summons yesterday, reached the Crime Branch office on Saturday morning. His visit to the UP SIT came amid rumours of his escape to Nepal. On Friday, the Uttar Pradesh Government was pulled up by the Supreme Court which questioned why there was a delay in the arrest of Ashish Mishra. ""What is the message that we are sending? In normal circumstances, if 302 case (murder case) is registered what will police do? Go and arrest the accused""! CJI observed.  After being confronted by Republic TV, Ashish Mishra had broken his silence on the Lakhimpur-Kheri violence and had claimed that he was not present at the site of the incident. His statement came after a video of the Lakhimpur-Kheri violence was shared by opposition parties including Congress and AAP on social media. The 29-second video shows a car travelling at high speed mowing down farmers who are protesting. Moreover, Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) has claimed that one of the farmers was shot dead by Ashish Misra. An FIR has been filed against both Ajay Mishra and his son under Section 302.  Violence in Lakhimpur Kheri ensued when farmers began protesting against the Farm Laws outside an event venue where Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya was scheduled to attend on October 3. Claiming that Ashish Mishra shot down protestors and ran over them with his car, farmers resorted to stone-pelting and killed 4 BJP workers with lathis and swords. "

Bharat along with Australian power-hitter Glenn Maxwell resurrected RCB's innings after they were reduced to 55/3 in the 10th over chasing 165. Meanwhile, KS Bharat explained what he was going through as he struck Delhi pacer Avesh Khan's final delivery with brute force that eventually made its way out of the boundary line. ""First of all to have the trust, to allow me to play those three balls means a lot to me. We have been practicing in the RCB camp. We have practices in these hard scenarios where everyone can walk in and win a game and it absolutely came off. I'm very grateful,"" he added. ""Since I had batted 50 balls and plus, the team would expect me to finish off things when you have a start, slow starts say five balls and you are taking your time so, it is our i.e. batters' responsibility to finish things once you are set and I was sticking to the plan,"" the stumper further added. Coming back to the DC vs RCB clash, which was also the final league game of the IPL 2021, the Bangalore bowlers succeeded in restricting the Delhi batsmen to 166/3 from their 20 overs after Pant & Co. were put in to bat by Virat Kohli. Even though Glenn Maxwell and KS Bharat had revived RCB's innings, DC had them on the mat after Proteas pacer Anrich Nortje had bowled an outstanding penultimate over where he conceded just four runs as Bangalore required 15 runs off the last over. Skipper Rishabh Pant gave the ball to Avesh Khan who was not having a very good day. Nonetheless, he started off with a slower ball outside off-stump which was successfully driven past the mid-off fielder for four runs. Avesh conceded just three runs off the next two deliveries as the equation came down to 8 runs needed off 3 deliveries. With KS Bharat on strike, the DC speedster bowled a full delivery outside off-stump as the batter swung and missed. The bowler heaved a sigh of relief as he was seen laughing after having got the better of the Bharat on that occasion. Unfortunately, his early celebration got the better of him. Khan then bowled a yorker around off as Bharat dug it out and ran two to retain strike. The final delivery turned out to be a wide full-toss which not only gave away an extra run to Bangalore but also cost Delhi an extra ball which worked extremely well in the Virat Kohli-led team's favour as KS Bharat lofted a straight full-toss for a huge six as the three-time finalists got over the line by seven wickets. KS Bharat was adjudged the Man of the Match for his match-winning knock. His unbeaten 52-ball 78 included three boundaries and four maximums at a strike rate of exactly 150."

The 26-foot high copper statue was the centrepiece of Hong Kong’s annual candlelight vigil on June 4 which commemorates student protesters killed by Chinese troops in 1989. Sculpted by Danish Sculptor Jens Galschiot, the gigantic statute called the ‘Pillar of shame’ features 50 anguished faces and tortured bodies piled atop each other and was in place for 24 years.  The Hong Kong University announced the decision in an online statement asking the Hong Kong Alliance (HKA)-a disbanded group in charge of organising the annual march- to remove the statue by October 13. “If you fail to remove the sculpture … it will be deemed abandoned,” the letter said. Meanwhile, soon after the decision was announced, the statue’s creator Jens Galschiot lambasted the University, reckoning that he was “shocked” to see the desecration of the memorial of such an important event in Chinese history.  The Tiananmen crackdown began in 1989 when China’s leaders sent tanks and troops to quell student protesters calling for democracy and an end to corruption. According to reports, more than 1,000 perished. Three decades on, the crackdown remains one of the most sensitive subjects in mainland China. However, in the semi-autonomous city, the memory of Tiananmen has been kept alive.  Sharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China said, ""The ban comes amid an alarming acceleration of attacks on the autonomy of Hong Kong and the undermining of the rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people guaranteed under Hong Kong and international law”.  Even Amnesty International believes that the authorities should have facilitated a socially distanced vigil rather than banning it. “COVID-19 must not be used as an excuse to stifle freedom of expression,"" said Joshua Rosenzweig, the group's deputy director for East and Southeast Asia. “With this ban and a disastrous national security law looming, it is not clear if Hong Kong’s Tiananmen vigil will ever be allowed to take place again.”"

US State Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights Uzra Zeya will travel to Haiti and Panama from October 12-17 to initiate discussions about the migrant situation amid internal conflicts. The US Department of State informed that Zeya is scheduled to meet with Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry and Minister of Justice Liszt Quitel to address issues of internal conflicts in Haiti and matters concerning large scale migrations to the US. Aiming to boost opportunities for free and fair elections in Haiti, Under Secretary Zeya will pipe up talks about how the nation can provide better security for all its citizens. The diplomats will also address issues concerning support for returned Haitian migrants. Following this, Zeya is expected to discuss the investigation into ex-Haitian President Jovonel Moise's assassination and the three prominent massacres - Bel-Air, La Saline, and Grand Ravine- that pushed the nation into a deepening humanitarian crisis. To express gratitude for the unvetted humanitarian assistance and earthquake recovery efforts in Haiti, Zeya will also meet Chiefs of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and UNICEF in the same period. As per a US State Department press release, these meetings will advance partnerships that are addressing the root causes of migration in Haiti and support Haitian-led efforts towards restoration of democratic institutions. On October 14, US State Under-Secretary will engage in a ""high-level"" Security Dialogue with the Panama government and President Cortizo. The discussions will advance for talks about the collaboration between Panama to jointly address issues about regional migration challenges, strategic measures to curb money laundering and drug trafficking, the press release mentioned. Lastly, while in Panama, Zeya will travel to Darien to meet civil societies and non-governmental organisations to further learn and collaborate on migration management and international protection. US ex-President Donald Trump, without any solid proof, said that Haitian migrants who are seeking asylum in America are “probably” inflicted with AIDS. “We have hundreds of thousands of people flowing in from Haiti. Haiti has a tremendous AIDS problem. AIDS is a step beyond. AIDS is a real problem,” Trump said during a telephonic interview with Fox News. He also added that dozens of countries are “emptying out their prison” by purposely sending out their “roughest prisoners” to the US."

In Delhi, the price of a non-subsidised 14.2 kg cylinder costs Rs 899.50. While 5 kg cylinder price stands at Rs 502. The exchange rate of the rupee against the dollar and the global benchmark rate are the two main factors that influence the LPG cylinders price in India.  India imports more than 80 per cent of its petrol and diesel. Brent crude oil has a massive effect on this. A barrel of crude oil's price fluctuates on a daily basis. Fuel prices in India are changed on a daily basis in response to changes in global crude oil prices. Import prices are rising in line with global crude oil prices. However, this is only one factor that contributes to the high retail pricing. The rest is entirely made up of taxes."

Taking a dig at the Congress leader, Cheema said, ""Sidhu had also shown how much respect he has for the SC community and CM Charanjit Singh Channi by refusing to wait for even two minutes for the latter to arrive on the occasion of (the) start of the party's protest on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident issue""  The Akali Dal leader alleged that the Scheduled Caste card played by the Congress to divert attention from its failures in Punjab had boomeranged.  The purported incident took place when a Sidhu-led Congress delegation had assembled in Mohali on Thursday before heading for Lakhimpur Kheri in UP to meet the families of the farmers killed in the violence there. Currently, the former Punjab Congress Chief is 'on a hunger strike' demanding action be taken against MoS Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra outside.  Meanwhile, MoS Home Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra was summoned again in relation to the Lakhimpur violence on Friday. Further, the police have informed that two persons had been arrested and that the autopsy report had revealed that no firearm injuries were found on the deceased. IG Lakshmi Singh categorically stated that no arrest has been made in relation to Ashish Mishra and said that the inquiry was ongoing."

According to an official statement, a total of 15 locations were searched during the search operation on Tuesday, which took place in Kolkata, Guwahati, Rangia, Meghalaya, Shillong, and Patna. Shell companies were reportedly being used to launder the unexplained profits back into the firm. Many paper enterprises are controlled by the organisation to give accommodation entry to its flagship concern, according to evidence discovered during the search. These paper companies were discovered to be non-existent at the addresses they provided. During the search, incriminating evidence revealing fraudulent unsecured loans, bogus commissions paid, and bogus share premiums obtained through shell companies, according to the Union ministry. This data suggests that a sum of more than Rs 50 crore may be missing, it informed. The group was also discovered to be incorrectly listing tribal individuals as creditors, with debts totalling roughly Rs 38 crore. During the search, data of certain offshore businesses and bank accounts were also discovered, which were presumably not mentioned in the appropriate tax reports, according to the announcement. The other group is working on railway contracts in Assam, Mizoram, and other parts of the North East, according to the Finance Ministry. During the search, incriminating papers, loose sheets, and digital data were discovered, revealing unregistered land and property investments. A substantial number of sale deeds for land and properties have been discovered, with a potential value of over Rs 110 crore. There was no corroborating evidence to explain the source of these assets' acquisition during the search. The Ministry also reported that documents detailing information of cash transactions totalling more than Rs 13 crore in the sale of properties had been discovered. The Union government went on to say that the searches and seizures led to the discovery of hidden income worth more than Rs 250 crore. A total of Rs 51 lakh in unauthorised cash was seized. Prohibition orders have been issued for nine bank lockers that have yet to be used. More investigations are underway. A shell company is a corporation that simply exists on paper, with no office or staff. It may have a bank account, passive investments, or be the registered owner of assets like intellectual property or ships. Shell companies can be registered at the address of a corporation that offers a service for forming shell companies and can also act as an agent for legal correspondence.  Without any significant assets or operations, the corporation might serve as an intermediary for business transactions. Shell corporations are sometimes used for tax evasion, tax avoidance, and money laundering, as well as to achieve a specific aim like anonymity. Anonymity can be used to protect personal assets from others, such as a spouse, creditors, and government officials, among other things. A corporate shell can also be built around a partnership to limit the partners' responsibility and other business activities, or to protect one portion of a corporation from the hazards of another. Shell corporations can be used to transfer assets from one company to another while keeping the former company's liabilities."

An SC bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna allowed a plea filed by the CBI against the Telangana High Court's order quashing the FIR registered against Indian Revenue Service officer TH Vijayalakshmi and her husband Audimulapu Suresh. The latter is a YSRCP MLA and currently the Education Minister in the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Andhra Pradesh government. As per the FIR filed by the CBI's Anti-Corruption Branch in Chennai on September 20, 2017, Vijayalakshmi possessed assets disproportionate to her known sources of income whereas the YSRCP legislator was accused of abetting the offence. Their disproportionate assets were estimated at Rs.1.10 crore which was 22.86% of their total income earned between April 1, 2010, to February 29, 2016. Thus, they were booked for offences punishable under Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 109 of the IPC.  Via its order dated February 11, 2020, the Telangana HC quashed the FIR citing that the central agency should have conducted a preliminary enquiry before registering the FIR. It also held that the CBI's allegations are prima facie unsustainable on the basis of information ascertained from their known sources of income. Arguing before the SC, Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati questioned the jurisdiction of the Telangana HC to entertain the writ petition and contended that a preliminary enquiry is not essential when adequate information is available to register a regular case.  It added, ""In a Preliminary Enquiry, the CBI is allowed access to documentary records and speak to persons just as they would in an investigation, which entails that information gathered can be used at the investigation stage as well. Hence, conducting a Preliminary Enquiry would not take away from the ultimate goal of prosecuting accused persons in a timely manner. However, we once again clarify that if the CBI chooses not to hold a Preliminary Enquiry, the accused cannot demand it as a matter of right"". Setting aside the HC judgment, the SC observed that the single-judge bench exceeded its ambit by virtually conducting a trial. "

The defendant had argued in the court that he had been in jail for over 105 days and that since the charge sheet was filed, he shouldn't be remanded in custody. The defendant further argued in court that the deceased was addicted to social media, including Tik Tok. Kiran said that Vismaya's Facebook account was deleted with the aim to let her concentrate on her studies. However, the prosecution told the court that there was evidence that Kiran had repeatedly tortured Vismaya and that bail should not be granted. The 500-page charge sheet says that Vismaya committed suicide due to dowry harassment. There were about 102 witnesses and 56 pieces of evidence in connection with the case. The evidence also included digital proofs of Vismaya being tortured by her husband. Police had also found a chat on the phone of accused Kiran's sister Keerthi where Vismaya had asked her sister-in-law's help to save her. The death of Vismaya forced the state government to implement stronger policies to curb the dowry menace. Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan had visited Vismaya's home. Subsequently, The Governor observed a full-day fast and also imposed rule for all graduating students to sign an anti-dowry affidavit across universities in Kerala. If you are aware of anyone in the state of mental distress and needs assistance, call the Helpline number: 18005990019 Vismaya, 22, was found dead at Kiran's house in Sasthamcotta in Kollam in the early hours of June 21. Kiran had allegedly physically abused her only a few days prior, and she had sent images of it to a relative. Kiran had reportedly assaulted Vismaya and her brother at her home in front of her parents after the couple had lived apart for a short time. On the other hand, Kiran had picked her up from college when she went to give her examinations. Vismaya's father had previously said that she had called her mother and told her about her husband's abuse. Meanwhile, Kiran's parents told various news outlets contradictory stories about what transpired the night before she died."

One major reason for the Britons to head to South Africa, she said, was the weather. “We are going into summer, the UK is going towards autumn and many British people have not been able to travel to sunny places, so that makes South Africa a great destination for them,” Anderson was quoted as saying by AP. South Africa has seen a considerable fall in coronavirus caseload with 33,013 cases currently active in the country. Notably, the British administration had attracted considerable flak for its decision to keep the country in the red list while lifting restrictions from others.  The British administration recently announced that starting 11 October, the number of countries in the red list will be cut down from 54 to just 7. Major tourist destinations like South Africa, Brazil and Mexico would be removed from the list. Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama, Peru and Venezuela continue in the red list. Last month, the UK simplified its travel rules by nixing the amber list from its travel rules.  (Image: AP) (With inputs from AP )"

Addressing a brief, Ramiz Raja claimed that 50% of PCB was running on the funding of the International Cricket Council (ICC), which in turn, was largely functioning on the funds of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Given BCCI's heavy funding in ICC, Ramiz Raja feared that PCB would collapse if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to pull out the funds one day.  The video of the PCB chief's statement was shared by BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya. In the video, the PCB chief addresses the Senate Standing Committee on Inter-Provincial Coordination saying,  On Thursday, Ramiz Raja had taken to Twitter to announce that the England & Wales Cricket Board Chief had resigned from his post. As soon as Ramiz Raja broke the news of the ECB chief's resignation, netizens started grilling the PCB head. As a result, Ramiz Raja deleted his 'erroneously' tweeted statement and also apologized for the same.  England and Wales Cricket Board on Thursday informed that chairman Ian Watmore would step down with immediate effect. According to ECB, he has reached a mutual agreement with the board to step down following the end of the domestic season. Previously, Ramiz Raja had come under the limelight after he lashed out at New Zealand for cancelling their tour of Pakistan. The PCB chief had threatened the Black Caps saying that they would hear from Pakistan at the ICC for their unilateral decision. New Zealand had pulled out of its Pakistan tour owing to 'security concerns'. Days later, England followed suit and called off their three-match ODI and five-match T20I series."

While speaking to reporters, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Biden declined to assert privilege over documents pertaining to the Trump administration. Psaki added that the US President has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not warranted for the first set of documents from the Trump White House that have been provided by the National Archives.  According to CNN, the National Archives has already identified documents in response to the committee request. They have also shared the documents with Trump’s legal team and the White house. On Friday, Psaki informed that the documents are Trump-ear White House records responsive to the select committee’s request to the archivist, however, she did not say what the form of documents were, such as phone records or visitors’ logs.  Now, the House Committee investigating the January 6 insurrection has the momentous task of sorting through the details and obtaining documents and testimony from witnesses who may or may not be cooperative. Trump, who told his supporters to “fight like hell” the morning of the horrifying incident and who has repeatedly defended the rioters who beat the police and broke into the Capitol building, is trying to block Congress from learning more. Biden, on the other hand, has so far sided with House Democrats, who have asked for thousands of pages of documents and subpoenaed witnesses connected to the former President.  In a separate development, a lawyer for Steve Bannon has said that the former White House aide won’t comply with the House committee’s probe because Trump is asserting executive privilege. Two other aides, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and former Pentagon aide Kash Patel, on the other hand, are engaging with the committee on their subpoenas. Meanwhile, it is to mention that the House Committee has subpoenaed 13 other individuals connected to the planning of January 6 and set deadlines for documents and interviews later this month. "

According to the NCB, the raids come in connection with the Cruise ship drug case which has seen the high-profile arrest of several including Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan who is currently lodged at Arthur Road Jail. The agency has alleged that Imtiyaz Khatri, who is the son of a renowned Mumbai-based builder, is involved in the case. He is said to be close to several Bollywood actors and was also accused of supplying drugs in the Sushant Singh Rajput matter. Further details related to the NCB raids are awaited. So far, the NCB has arrested 18 individuals in connection with the cruise ship drug case. On October 3, the NCB busted a high-profile party on a cruise ship that was en route from Mumbai to Goa. The party allegedly involving celebrities, including actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan, was apprehended by the NCB after an eight-hour-long operation.

The UDF stated in a notice of adjournment motion filed by Congress MLA PC Vishnunath that the Kerala government was hiding COVID-19 deaths. The state Opposition staged a walkout after the Assembly Speaker refused to allow a discussion on the same.  Earlier, on Tuesday, the United Democratic Front (UDF) had staged a walkout from the state Assembly, saying that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was protecting top police officials with ties to Monson Maunkal, a fraudulent antique dealer convicted of defrauding people out of crores of rupees. In response to Congress MLA PT Thomas' notice of adjournment motion on the topic, Vijayan disputed that top cops in the state tried to protect Monson Maunkal and said that the police probe into the case is ongoing. Concerning the opposition's claim that former Kerala DGP Lokanath Behera and other senior officials paid a visit to Maunkal's home, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that soon after the DGP's visit, he had requested the Intelligence wing to conduct an investigation on 21 December 2019. Taking up the Monson Maunkal case in the Assembly, Leader of Opposition VD Satheesan argued that police received intelligence in May 2019 that Maunkal was a fraudster and that his antiques were fake, and that they had presented a full inquiry report in January 2020 indicating that he was a fraud. Monson Mavunkal was arrested by the Crime Branch for allegedly defrauding customers by selling fake antiquities. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) was also constituted by the police, with Crime Branch Thiruvananthapuram Range IG Sparjan Kumar leading the team under Crime Branch Head S Sreejith. Separately, VD Satheeshan had stunned the Kerala Legislative Assembly to rapt silence when he placed before the floor of the house issues that were being faced by victims of endosulfan after the remediation cell for the victims became dysfunctional.  His speech struck the emotional chord of the house when he elaborated on the apathy of the government machinery towards the victims of the northern district of Kerala. While the adjournment motion was introduced by Kasargod MLA NA Nelikkunnu, it was Satheeshan's well-defined and intense speech that moved the house unanimously to silence as he brought out many facets of the apathy.

https://t.co/byuCjaXCrs",https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/politics/rjds-shivanand-tiwari-questions-rahul-gandhis-leadership-for-2024-calls-congress-weak.html,4.0,24.0,EXCLUSIVE RJD's Shivanand Tiwari Questions Rahul Gandhi's Leadership For 2024; Calls Congress 'weak',"The grand old Congress Party has been facing mass exodus in the recent past, posing a serious question mark on the leadership of the Gandhi family. Congress is not only plagued with desertion from its rank and file, but one of its oldest allies, the RJD, has also started questioning the leadership of the Congress and its support base. National Vice President of RJD, Shivanand Tiwari in an exclusive interview to Republic TV  has termed Congress a 'weak party' and suggested to its high command to introspect & diagnose the mass exodus from the party as well as the party's waning support base. After the exodus of senior leaders from the Congress party, Kapil Sibal and Ghulam Nabi Azad raised questions and asked for the overhauling of the organization. RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari echoed the sentiments of the senior Congress leaders. Congress has lost its support base in many states. In the recently held Bengal assembly polls, Congress failed to open its account. Speaking on the same, Shivanand Tiwari said, ""The Congress is in a direct fight against the BJP on 200 Lok Sabha seats, but on the rest of the seats it has to put the regional parties on the driving seat. Congress is weak in Bihar, Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and few other states. When Mandal commission was implemented, Rajiv Gandhi opposed it, which led to the Congress party being wiped out in the Hindi belt ."" In the 2021 assembly polls, RJD had contested Tarapur, and Congress contested on Kushehwarasthan assembly constituency as a part of the alliance. But considering the weak support base of the Congress in Bihar, RJD has fielded candidates for both the assembly by-polls being held on 30th October, leading to a war of words between Congress and RJD. Tejashwi Yadav led the RJD from the front during the Bihar assembly polls in the absence of his father Lalu Yadav. Shivanand Tiwari, while praising Tejashwi said that ""He has the trait of a big leader and he has proven his worth. He set the narrative of employment in Bihar polls which Nitish Kumar and BJP had to follow "". The drifting support base in the majority of the states and the mass exodus is an alarm bell for the Congress party. Young and trusted leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasad have already left the party, while Sachin Pilot despite all his hard work in Rajasthan has been cold-shouldered. There is a growing restlessness among the party leaders regarding the future of the party. Taking cognizance, G23 leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad & Kapil Sibal have spoken up to revamp the party. The mishandling in Punjab has also done no good to the Congress leadership. Now, with allies like RJD losing confidence, it is not a good sign for Congress. But the RJD should also not discount the national presence of Congress in Bihar. Lalu Yadav committed the same mistake of not giving a single seat to the Congress party in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, despite Lalu being a part of the UPA1 govt.  Congress and RJD fought against each other with RJD winning 4 seats and Congress winning 2 seats. Congress formed the UPA govt and Lalu Yadav was not accommodated in the Union Government despite winning Lok Sabha elections from Saran. In 2013, Rahul Gandhi fell out with Lalu and moved the anti-corruption bill, and Lalu Yadav lost his Lok Sabha membership after being convicted in the fodder scam. Is History repeating itself and has Tejashwi Yadav made the same mistake that his father made in 2009?"

https://t.co/smp64vojMt",https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/air-indias-deal-with-tata-groups-talace-pvt-ltd-heres-everything-you-need-to-know.html,9.0,63.0,Air India's Deal With Tata Group's Talace Pvt Ltd; Here's Everything You Need To Know,"On October 8, the Ministry of Finance approved the Air India disinvestment to the Tata Group, via a wholly-owned subsidiary Talace Pvt Ltd, which emerged as the frontrunner to acquire the commercial air carrier company. A group of Ministers (GoM), headed by Home Minister Amit Shah, reconstituted the panel named Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) which was first formed in 2017 and headed by then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Shah ratified the winning bid along with other members of AISAM, namely, Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal.  Marking the third attempt of the Government of India (GoI) to get rid of the decade-long loss-incurring air carrier, the salt-to-software conglomerate placed a winning bid of ₹ 18,000 crores to re-acquire the airline more than 65 years after it ceded control to the government. The Tata Group – which owns stakes in Vistara airlines and Air Asia has been eyeing to bring Air India back into Tata's folds for a long time. Air India, which was founded by J.R.D. Tata, a licenced pilot, in 1932, had been operating a few mail carriers in the 1930s between Karachi in then undivided and British-ruled India and Bombay. The Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), Tuhin Kant Pandey, laid out salient pointers of the deal as Tatasons’ SPV – Talace Pvt Ltd – wins the bid for Air India.  Air India was taken over by GoI in 1953 after the air carrier was nationalised. While JRD Tata was initially made head of Air India's board, he was later dropped from the re-constituted board of both Air India and Indian Airlines in 1978 - an incident that still stings the Tatas. Notably, Tata Sons, the holding company and owner of British luxury automobile manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, managed to acquire the brand subsequent to PM Modi's bold privatisation plan to prevent a stretched budget deficit.  Upon translating into a government-owned commercial carrier in the 1940s, Air India rapidly emerged popular among the affluent and contrary to today's branding, its advertisements and promotion featured Bollywood actresses while passengers on board were served expensive champagnes and designer-made porcelain ashtrays, as per archived reports.  However, of late after Gulf and other private domestic brands started to order cheaper tickets en routes to Europe and the US via layovers in Middle East Asia, Air India suffered losses. Considering the conglomerate holds major shares in AirAsia India and Vistara which is a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd, Air India has not earned a profit since 2007, after its merger with Indian Airlines. The Tata group can take advantage of the reputation it carries and other assets it possesses, such as Vistara's designated landing and parking spaces at London's Heathrow."

As per sources, this exercise commenced from Friday when Adityanath interacted with MLAs, MPs and party office-bearers hailing from the Awadh region at his official residence. UP BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh was also present in this meeting. Union MoS Home Ajay Mishra who is facing increasing calls to resign over his son Ashish Mishra's alleged involvement reportedly met Adityanath on this occasion as the Lakhimpur-Kheri district is a part of Awadh.  Meanwhile, sources also revealed that BJP will address social seminars all over the state from October 13 keeping an eye on the UP polls. This is perceived to be a strategy to solicit the support of various sections of society for the saffron party. Ministers in the state government, parliamentarians, legislators and BJP office-bearers will participate in these social seminars.  In the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, BJP won a whopping 312 seats in the 403-member House, whereas BSP could win only 19 seats. On the other hand, the SP-Congress alliance failed to bear fruit as it could win in only 54 constituencies. While this was seen as a mandate for PM Modi as BJP had not declared any CM candidate, Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath was a surprise pick for the post. Though some BJP leaders made conflicting statements over Adityanath's future as the Chief Minister, PM Modi put rest to all speculations by lauding UP's governance model during his successive visits to the state. Leaving no stone unturned for the 2022 Assembly election, BJP appointed Dharmendra Pradhan as its election in-charge and Anurag Thakur, Arjun Ram Meghwal, Shobha Karandlaje, Annapurna Devi, Saroj Pandey and Vivek Thakur as the co-in-charges. Meanwhile, Sanjay Bhatia, Sanjeev Chaurasiya, Y Satya Kumar, Sudhir Gupta, Arvind Menon and Sunil Oza as the organizational in-charges of Western UP, Braj, Awadh, Kanpur, Gorakhpur and Kashi. On September 24, BJP formally announced an alliance with the Nishad Party and Apna Dal(S). While Apna Dal(S) president Anupriya Patel is the Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, the Nishad party chief's son Praveen Kumar Nishad won from Sant Kabir Nagar in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls on a BJP ticket. Moreover, Adityanath expanded his Council of Ministers on September 26 by inducting Sanjeev Kumar, Dinesh Khatik, Paltu Ram, Dharmvir Prajapati, Dr. Sangeeta Balwant, Chhatrapal Singh Gangwar and Jitin Prasada. Providing representation to the SC, OBC and Brahmin community in the government is being perceived as a significant move ahead of the UP polls. "

Detached from civilian life but serving fellow humans, Chandrashekar has made his favourite car, an old white ambassador his home to reside in. When one walks about 3-4km inside the jungle, a  small plastic sheet resting on bamboo poles under which a colour faded old ambassador car with functional radio playing old Hindi melodies will be heard, and this is the living space of the man who chose to live an isolated life after experiencing various troubles in life. All he now wants is to get his land back that was lost as he was unable to repay the loan to the bank. The 56-year old man owned over 1.5 acres of land in Nekral Kemraje village, where he grew areca nuts and lived a peaceful life. But unable to repay a loan of Rs 40,000 taken from a co-operative bank in 2003, the bank auctioned Chandrashekar’s farm. Following this, he drove his ambassador car to his sister’s house in Adtale but a continued rift with his sister’s family led to his decision to live alone after a few days. Without a single thought, he drove into the jungle and parked his favorite car, and from then on it's just been him and his car.  Chandrashekar, therefore, has been living in his car alone for 17 years with no shave-no haircut, and 2 pieces of clothing and rubber slippers on him. With his lean physique and strong limbs, the man has adjusted to life in the wilderness. He bathes in the river that runs through the forest. He weaves baskets from dried creepers and sells them in an Adtale village shop, travelling with his old bicycle. In exchange, he takes the rice, sugar, and other groceries.  The man lives amid the wild animals. He encounters several elephants, Bison, wild boar, leopard, and snakes very often. The forest department isn't considered about his stay in the forest as he has never damaged or looted forest resources. The only resource he uses is the dead creepers to weave baskets. Chandrashekar said, ""I will lose the trust of the forest department if even a small shrub is chopped."" Upon hearing this man's life, A B Ibrahim, the District Collector visited him a few years ago in his ‘ambassador abode’ and assured him a proper house to live in. But, Chandrashekar denied staying in the house reasoning that it was in the middle of a rubber forest and he didn’t like living there.  Aranthod Gram Panchayath visited him and gave him his dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, despite not having an Aadhaar card. He had a tough time during the lockdown as he survived only on water and wild fruits. After living here for 17 long years, Chandrashekar still dreams of getting back to his plot and driving his ambassador home, although his old ‘abode’ may be too derelict to move around by now."

Messi has won the Ballon dOr on six occasions, and Ronaldo takes a close second place with five awards to his name.  The last time the prestigious football award was organised was in 2019. The Ballon dOr 2019 awards were held at Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris on December 2, 2019, where Lionel Messi was adjudged the winner of the prestigious award for a record sixth time in his career. The award ceremony was scrapped off in 2020 due to the global pandemic. At the same time, there is a possibility of the personal accolade moving away from the Southern European nation for the first time since 'CR7' won the award in 2008 while representing Manchester United as both Ronaldo and Messi are no longer playing in Spain. While Ronaldo is back to the 'Theatre of Dreams', Leo is currently associated with the French club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). However, this would only be possible if either one of them manages to win the Ballon dOr 2021."

Ishan Kishan's form has been in question ahead of the T20 World Cup, but the left-hander smashed two back to back half-centuries to silence the critics. The Jharkhand cricketer smashed 84 runs off 32 balls against SRH in an innings consisting of 11 fours and 4 sixes. The knock helped Mumbai Indians win the match by 42 runs, but the chance of qualifying for the IPL 2021 playoffs diminished. During the post-match interview, Ishan Kishan revealed the conversation he had with RCB skipper Virat Kohli. Ishan Kishan on Friday dominated the SRH bowlers with skipper Rohit Sharma being a mere spectator at the other end. The youngster sent bowlers for a leather hunt right from ball number one which decreased the pressure from Mumbai Indians skipper Rohit Sharma.  Speaking during the post-match presentation Ishan Kishan spoke about how happy he is happy to regain his form back. He said, “A very good thing for me and for the team getting some runs, and getting into good touch before the World Cup. Was in good state mind of mind, was very positive. We had to get somewhere around 250-260, it was the intent and positive intent. The one I smacked Malik through the covers – that’s the one (his favourite shot).” Revealing the details of his chat with RCB skipper Virat Kohli post the RCB vs MI match, Ishan Kishan said that Virat Kohli had told him that he has been selected as an opener in the T20 World Cup squad and how his teammates helped him cope with the poor form. He said, ""In this tournament, you have to be prepared for every circumstance. It’s important to be in the right mindset and you need to go with your best form. I had a good chat with Virat bhai, Jasprit bhai also helped me. Even HP, KP were there to support me. Everyone supported me and they said it’s a learning stage for you, make sure you learn from here and don’t make the same mistakes in the upcoming WC games.""

In a statement issued on October 3, the OIC General Secretariat criticised the Assam eviction drive which killed two persons and injured several others, alleging that it was part of a 'campaign' against the Muslim community. ""The OIC's General Secretariat indicated that the media reports are disgraceful and call for a responsible stance by the government and officials in the Republic of India,"" it said. Two people were killed and several others were injured in a violent clash between the locals and the police at the Dholpur Gorukhuti area in Assam's Darrang district on September 23. On the day, a team of state police was visiting the area to evict 60 families who had illegally encroached on land belonging to a state farming project. However, to protest against the eviction, an unprecedented crowd of 800 protestors gathered at the spot, raised slogans against the eviction drive, and clashed with the Assam Police."

The update is such that the company will not post ads with wrong information about climate change on the Google Search Engine or on its video-sharing platform YouTube. Keep reading to know more about the changes made by Google in its ads and monetisation policy.  As mentioned in the blog post, Google says ""today, we’re announcing a new monetization policy for Google advertisers, publishers and YouTube creators that will prohibit ads for, and monetisation of, content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change."" Google also says ""publishers and creators don't want advertisements promoting these claims to appear on their pages or videos."" The content that would not be eligible for monetisation includes content referring to climate change as false, claims that deny global warming, and claims that deny greenhouse has emissions or human activity has a role in climate change. The Google blog post also adds that it will differentiate between content that puts up false information as a fact and content that reports or discusses the false claims.  Google has consulted experts who have contributed to United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment reports. The search engine giant will be using automated tools and human reviews to enforce the change in policy. The updated ads and monetisation policy will come into effect from next month, i.e. November 2021. It is clear that Google is trying to strengthen its stand of promoting sustainability and combatting climate changes.  This is a good step towards creating awareness about climate change. There is a lot of content on the internet that claims climate change is nothing but a hoax, which is not true. As and when Google prohibits such content to be monetized, it should affect the publishers and decrease the volume of misinformation that is floating on the internet. Additionally, Google has also been testing an AI-powered technology that reduced the amount of fuel consumption and air pollution at traffic signals by up to 20%. While the technology is still in the early development phase, Google has tested it in four locations in Israel and plans to expand the pilot to Rio de Janeiro"

He almost bowled a tight final over but failed to help his side register a close win. The last two balls bowled by the pacer mattered the most which completely changed the complexion of the game.  Even though RCB snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, it was Avesh Khan's expression after deceiving KS Bharat that stood out the most. The incident happened during the final over of the contest. Pacer Anrich Nortje had bowled an outstanding penultimate over where he conceded just four runs as RCB required 15 runs off the last over. Skipper Rishabh Pant gave the ball to Avesh Khan who was not having a very good day. Nonetheless, he started off with a slower ball outside off-stump which was successfully driven past the mid-off fielder for four runs. Avesh conceded just three runs off the next two deliveries as the equation came down to 8 runs needed off 3 deliveries. With KS Bharat on strike, the DC speedster bowled a full delivery outside off-stump as the batter swung and missed. The bowler heaved a sigh of relief as he was seen laughing after having got the better of the Bharat on that occasion. Inside the commentary box, legendary batter Sunil Gavaskar warned Avesh Khan not to celebrate too early. Khan then bowled a yorker around off as Bharat dug it out and ran two to retain strike. The final delivery turned out to be a wide full-toss which not only gave away an extra run to Bangalore but also cost Delhi an extra ball which worked extremely well in the Virat Kohli-led team's favour as KS Bharat lofted a straight full-toss for a huge six as the three-time finalists got over the line by seven wickets. Here's what the netizens had to say about Avesh Khan's early celebrations.  "

The attack on the Said Abad mosque on 8 October is said to be the deadliest blast since the Taliban takeover. The responsibility of the attack was claimed by Taliban rival ISIS-K, which has been staunchly opposing the Taliban administration and has repeatedly conducted attacks on Afghan soil.  According to the BBC, an ISIS operative detonated an explosive vest during the ritualistic Friday prayer. Notably, the Said Abad mosque is used by the Shia community, whom the ISIS deem as heretics. In the aftermath, the United Nations has condemned the attack asserting that the ""deadly attack"" was a part of ""disturbing pattern of violence"". It added that it was the third attack in the country within a week.  The UN chief condemned the “horrific” attack “in the stronges terms”, noting that it represents the third assault on a religious institution, in less than a week. The Secretary-General extended his condolences to the bereaved families and wished those injured a speedy recovery. “Attacks that deliberately target civilians exercising the right to freely practice their religion are violations of fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law”, said Secretary-General António Guterres, in a statement released by his Spokesperson. “The perpetrators must be brought to justice.” The explosion was followed by a separate blast through a Shia mosque during the Friday prayer in the same province. As per Amaj News, the name of the suicide bomber was Muhammad al-Uighuri.  Meanwhile, Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said on Twitter, ""Security forces are at the scene, and investigation is underway."" Additionally, it was reported that the attack took place at around 1:30 PM (local time). If the death toll is said to be true, it will be considered as the deadliest attack since US and NATO troops left Afghanistan at the end of August and the Taliban took control of the country. It is to mention that another explosion on Wednesday in Afghanistan’s Khost city killed seven and wounded 15 others. The incident took place at Mazharul Alum Madrasa, also known as Mazharul Alum religious school. (Image: AP )"

Addressing the members of the state unit of the BJP Kisan Morcha on October 3, Khattar urged them to raise a volunteer force of up to 1000 farmers in each district of north and west Haryana. Moreover, he asked them not to worry about the consequences of taking the law into their hands citing that they will emerge as ""big leaders"" once they are eventually released from jail.  Speaking to the media on Friday, Manohar Lal Khattar remarked, ""In the last few days, I gave a statement. The statement was given in the context of self-defence. It is being propagated that the CM gave a call to pick up sticks. It wasn't said with malice against anyone. It was said with respect to self-defence. Even then, some protesters have started demonstrating against it."" The SKM which is an umbrella body of several farm organizations protesting at the Delhi borders seeking the repeal of the farm laws welcomed this development and termed it a ""victory"" for farmers. It alleged that the Haryana CM's speech reflected BJP's mentality to convert peaceful protests into violent ones and crush them thereafter. Moreover, it asserted that farmers in more villages of Haryana will be made aware of the saffron party's purported ""anti-farmer and undemocratic violent"" mindset.

The declaration was driven by ""humanitarian concerns"" that reaffirms Biden's promises made during the election campaign, which sought to denounce Trump's limitations. ""By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the law of the United States...

Just three weeks before the UN COP26 summit, both officials lauded the collaborative progress achieved since the first and second Dialogues that happened in the years 2017 and 2018.  As per an official statement released from the British High Commission in India, after the meeting, Kwarteng said, “As we gear up to host the UN COP26 summit next month, today the UK and India have made important progress in outlining how this deep partnership can continue to deliver green growth for both countries powered by clean energy.” Secretary went on to say that continuing to support the transition to clean energy is a common goal, and the new joint initiative of India and the UK on smart power, renewable energy, as well as storage will assist to boost investments in renewable projects. This joint initiative will also generate new high-skilled employment across both countries.   Further, both parties have also acknowledged India's progress in using solar energy to power in the Indian railways and accepted the close association of the International Solar Alliance, which is headed by India that intends to generate over 1 trillion USD in solar energy investments by 2030. The ministers also highlighted the fact about how important it is to have a robust renewable energy industry as a foundation of a sustainable energy system.  They also supported an extensive clean energy forward action plan, which includes expanding the usage of renewable energy and storage, enhancing energy efficiency technologies, permitting the manufacture and use of green hydrogen, and promoting the transfer to electric transport.

https://t.co/LaT7WJmHUy",https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/indias-devastating-plan-to-dominate-china-in-the-skies-indian-air-forces-modernisation.html,3.0,69.0,EXPLAINED India's Devastating Plan To Dominate China In The Skies: Indian Air Force's Modernisation,"India’s Air Force is in the midst of a much-needed modernisation, bidding to phase out a mix of fighter aircraft that has served very well in the past but lacks the technological sophistication and capabilities to keep up with the changing security climate in the region. With India, very much a counterweight to China globally, the Dragon’s ‘all-weather’ alliance with Pakistan has necessitated India to be ready for what is referred to as a ‘two-front’ situation, meaning India needs to be ready to handle aggression on both its western border with Pakistan and the north-eastern border with China.  For this, the Air Force has an authorised strength of 42 squadrons of Fighter aircraft, which, however, isn’t likely to be reached in the next 15 years. The reason for this is manifold. On one hand, India is saddled with several squadrons of fighter aircraft that are now largely outdated, chief among them, the once-ubiquitous Soviet-made MiG-21 and its variants. But it’s not only the MiG that needs to go, rather, the continued usage of the 1960s era MiGs has also papered over the fact that a number of other Indian Air Force fighter jets are approaching the end of their extended lifespans. (The MiG-21 - Image: @IAF_MCC) This fact was emphasised by India’s new Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari at the annual IAF press conference. While announcing that the four remaining squadrons of the MiG would be phased out in the next four years, he also provided a timeline for what would happen to some of the other ageing fighter squadrons, like the Jaguar, the Mirages and the MiG-29s. Each of these has proven its use in combat operations. Days after the Balakot air strike, Pakistan had attempted another one of its misadventures, sending over a dozen of its American-made F-16 Viper fighters across the border, where they were intercepted by all the patrol fighters the IAF had in the skies at that time. In the skies over Nowshera, Wing Commander Abhinandan’s Mig-21 Bison thundered at the more advanced Pak Air Force jets, scuttling their ingress and foiling their bid to bomb India’s military and civilian infrastructure. The Wing Commander even shot down a Pak F-16 fighter before being downed by fire from below after having chased the enemy into its territory. (A U.S-made F-16 Flying Falcon 'Viper', operated by the Pak Air Force & many others - Image: @Indopacom) Wing Commander Abhinandan flew the MiG-21 again as part of the final sortie of former IAF Chief BS Dhanoa, and the MiG-21 was also the final sortie of Dhanoa’s successor, RKS Bhadauria, who is succeeded by Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari. The IAF has been adamant that it operates with all available aircraft, keeps them serviceable, and that the traditionally 3rd gen MiG-21 has been upgraded to 3.5G status, but over the last few decades, the fighter has been a victim of a number of accidents, often fatal, even finding its way into movies such as 2006 hit- Rang De Basanti.  At his presser, the new IAF Chief made a massive statement, when he said that not only would the MiGs be phased out within 4 years, but also, that the Mirage-2000s, the Jaguars and the MiG-29s would follow hot on its heels, and be decommissioned by the end of this decade. For the time being, however, these aircraft form a key component of the IAF’s tactical arsenal, with India even buying incomplete Mirage aircraft from France simply to use for parts to ensure serviceability of its own squadrons.  (IAF's Mirage-2000, MiG-29 and Jaguar aircraft respectively - Image: @IAF_MCC) But thoughts have long since turned towards what’s next for the IAF. And the plan for the future is roughly three-fold. The first crucial component is the HAL LCA or Hindustan Aeronautics Limited’s Light Combat Aircraft, otherwise known as the Tejas. The Tejas, which has been in development for decades, has reached fruition. The Indigenous aircraft quite closely resembles the Mirage, and most importantly, found a buyer in the Indian Air Force, which has ordered 83 Tejas LCA Mk1As and will begin deliveries in 2024, boosting India’s air power. There is also every chance that the Tejas, which continues to be the subject of incremental upgrades by HAL, could find a foreign buyer as well and become a shining light in India’s status as an economic power capable of exporting high technology. The Tejas aircraft that India will produce will dovetail with the Sukhoi Su30 MKI - the Russian-made warbird that rules the skies in terms of close-range combat and forms the vanguard of the Indian Air Force. The Sukhoi’s are fairly large aircraft but brilliantly engineered and aerodynamically superior to all but the most advanced US-made top-of-the-range fighter jets. They’re capable of stunning manoeuvres, and it is not for naught that they have admirers even amongst the civilian population, including former World Cup-winning India captain MS Dhoni who rates the Sukhois as his favourite. But while India operates over 250 Sukhois, China also operates a very large complement of fighters from the same family, including the Sukhoi Su-35, and while India’s fighters are more than a match for Pakistan’s F-16s and the pointless Chinese made J-17 Thunder the Pak Air Force operates, tackling China itself requires greater tactical options. That’s where India’s goal of purchasing 114 MRFAs - that is Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft comes in. The Dassault Rafale, the latest offering from France, is among the contenders for this mega-contract that the IAF is eyeing. But there are others as well. The Rafale squadron is now a key component of India’s firepower in the skies, being capable of a range of operations, and more are set to arrive from France. But the 114 MRFA contract is aimed at being a step beyond the government-to-government deal India did with France to buy 36 Rafales. Not only is it for significantly more fighter jets, but also, the 114 MRFAs are to be made in India with tech transfer.  Unlike China, which has few friends in high places, India has thus far managed to maintain strategic defence relations with the world powers. France and Rafale remain in contention, and the same is true of American manufacturers, with Lockheed Martin offering up the F-21 to India. The F-21 is a souped-up version of the F-16, which is among the most widely-used fighter aircraft of its capability in the world, and rather good to look at as well. Earlier, India has also been mentioned in the context of purchasing the Eurofighter Typhoon and was also at one time the development partner for Russia’s Sukhoi-57 before that deal fell apart. The idea of India inducting 114 of any of these fighters is likely to send a chill down Beijing’s power corridors, but there is one snag. Most of these - the Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon, as well as the upgraded US F-16s are what are known as 4.5 Generation aircraft. On the other hand, at the top of the range at the moment, sit what are known as 5th generation aircraft, and there are only a few proven makes in the world. What is believed to be the most dangerous fighter aircraft in the world at the moment is the American F-22 Raptor. This jet is lethal, combining advanced avionics and aerodynamics with that core component of 5th generation fighters - stealth. The F-22 is considered so far superior to all the others out there that it is said to be capable of taking on and destroying enemy aircraft even before they spot it visually or on the radar. The F-22 Raptor was built to replace the legendary F-15 Eagle, which is said to have downed over 100 enemy aircraft in dogfights without losing even once. Perhaps everyone should consider themselves lucky then that the F-22 Raptor is no longer in production and the US only operates about 180 of them. (A U.S-made F-22 Raptor - Image: @F22DemoTeam) The successor to the F-22 is the F-35 lightning, which is another 5th gen stealth fighter that is strategically more capable but has glaring limitations despite bringing one of the most expensive military projects in history. The F-35, which has also been sold to the UK, Australia, UAE and a number of other countries, is capable of vertical take-off and landing, and is, as such, planned to replace just about all the different fighter jets America operates at the moment. However, the American establishment is said to be entirely unconvinced by the F-35 and something more radical is alleged to be in development. However, the F-22 and F-35, via inspiration or espionage, appear to have given China some ideas, and this has resulted in India’s neighbour developing the J-20 Chengdu fighter, which China claims, is a 5th generation stealth air superiority fighter. At the moment, the J-20’s capabilities are taken with a pinch of salt, but there’s no doubt that with time, China will be able to iron out the kinks and turn up quite a deadly threat for India in the skies. It is perhaps heartening for this reason, that India has made the ability to integrate 5th generation and even the 6th generation technologies a key criterion for the 114 MRFAs it plans to acquire. And not only that… India has another ace up its sleeve. Buoyed with the development of the Tejas LCA, India is priming an entirely new beast. The DRDO’s Aeronautical Development Agency, or ADA, is developing what is known as the AMCA - or Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft. The AMCA will be a 5th or 6th generation fighter, with stealth and a number of other radical capabilities that if everything goes to plan, will be more than capable of taking on China’s jets, and will completely dominate the skies over Pakistan if called upon. The design has been in progress for almost 8 years, but now, there appears to be a more ambitious plan for the AMCA, with IAF Chief Chaudhary making it very clear that the Indian Air Force is fully committed to a more aggressive timeline in place. A scale model of the final design may be forthcoming soon, and after that, functional prototypes by the next few years, with commissioning planned for the next decade.  (An incomplete mock-up of DRDO's under-development AMCA fighter) The Indian Air Force is in transition, with a number of aircraft set to be phased out in the next few years that have proven themselves to be highly capable of thwarting the enemy in the past. But the next decade promises to bring about foreign and indigenous innovation to the table like never before. From fighter jets to drones, to advanced helicopters - India is all set to fly high - and those who wish to harm it from the skies had the best watch out."

Pouring cold water on the notion that the aggressive stance of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on the Lakhimpur violence will boost Congress' fortunes, poll strategist Prashant Kishor had made it clear that there are no quick-fix solutions to the ""deep-rooted problems"" and ""structural problems"" of the party. This came as a surprise as speculation was rife that Kishor was in touch with the Congress top brass to join the party. Baghel subsequently took an indirect swipe at Kishor by mocking TMC's ambition to increase its influence beyond West Bengal. Notably, the IPAC co-founder is perceived to have close ties with the TMC leadership and is credited for ensuring the Mamata Banerjee-led party's stupendous victory in the recently concluded WB Assembly polls. Lambasting TMC for ""poaching"" Congress leaders, the Chhattisgarh CM contended that concerted efforts are required for it to emerge as a ""national alternative"". After a hard-fought election campaign, TMC sprung a surprise by decisively winning the 2021 West Bengal Assembly election by bagging 213 seats whereas BJP could win in only 77 constituencies. Buoyed by its third consecutive victory, TMC is mulling projecting Mamata Banerjee as the Prime Ministerial candidate for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Making her national ambitions clear, Banerjee propagated the West Bengal model of governance in her Martyrs' Day rally speech on July 21. Thereafter, she visited Delhi and met various opposition leaders including Congress president Sonia Gandhi. In an attempt to expand its base across the country, TMC has increased its political activities in Tripura and Goa aimed at emerging as an alternative to Congress. However, the party has riled Congress in the process by inducting many of its leaders such as Sushmita Dev, Abhijit Mukherjee and former Goa CM Luizinho Faleiro. Incensed by the growing political capital of the Mamata Banerjee-led party, Congress recently accused TMC of indirectly helping BJP by dividing the secular votes. "

On Tuesday, October 5, three civilians were killed by terrorists. Later, on October 7, two school teachers were gunned down in the Union territory. Giving an update on the protest, RP Singh tweeted, ""Kashmiri Hindus are holding a protest on Saturday at 4:30 pm in New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar against the killing of minorities in the Kashmir valley. I will join and appeal all of you to join"".  Raising their voice against continued gruesome killings of Hindus in Kashmir, Panun Kashmir,  All India Kashmiri Samaj, Kashmiri Samithi Delhi, Roots In Kashmir, Jammu Kashmir Vichar Manch, and Youth 4 Panun Kashmir are organising the 'Stop Hindu Genocide' protest. According to the Kashmiri pandits, the Hindu genocide has been an unresolved issue since 1342. Earlier on October 6, Youth All India Kashmiri Samaj (YAIKS), the Kashmiri Pandit organisation in Jammu, demanding justice to the civilians killed in the terror attack, had staged a massive demonstration against Pakistan. They further demanded a permanent solution to eliminate terror attacks sponsored by Pakistan.  Makhan Lal Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit who has largely contributed to the development of the valley, was one of the civilians killed on Tuesday, October 5. The daughter of the Kashmiri Pandi said that hatred is not stopped by hatred, but only by love. Makhan Lal's daughter told Republic, ""I'm not shedding a single tear as my father wouldn't like that. He has raised his children to be brave and educated"". She urged the people of Kashmir to educate their children to live a life rather than giving them a gun to kill people.  She added, ""I don't know which politician has given money to the murders to carry out these attacks. My father might be dead but the spirit of a true Kashmiri Pandit can never be destroyed"". "

In a televised phone call interview with Fox News, when Trump was questioned on COVID-19 testing protocols for refugees, he made several unfounded claims about immigrants and even spoke of a conspiracy by other nations against the United States.  Further, Trump went on to say that dozens of countries are “emptying out their prison” by purposely sending newly-released prisoners to America. He claimed that around 50 nations are emptying out their prisons into the US. Trump also added that some of the toughest people on the Earth are being dumped into the US because they don’t want them.  Meanwhile, this is not the first time Trump has made and anti-refugee remarks. Back in 2017, the New York Times had quoted the former US President saying that around 15,000 Haitians sent by the nation’s government to the US “all had AIDS”. However, back then, the White House had denied the claim and said that Trump did not make any such remark. The following year, the Washington Post reported that Trump wanted immigrants from countries like Norway, instead of “sh**hole countries” when asked about immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations as part of a bipartisan immigration bill.

On the other hand, Instagram was said to be completely down during this period. However, the outage did not affect all users.

Users of the social networking platforms received error messages for the most part of the day which in turn, pulled down the stocks of the Silicon Valley firm by nearly 5%. While the company has not been completely clear as to what caused the 6-hour disruption, Facebook held a 'Domain Name System' (DNS) error on its main page responsible. Cloudflare senior vice president Dane Knecht stated that the social media giant had encountered a 'technical glitch' in its border gateway protocol routes, also known as the 'BGP'. If Facebook's DNS records disappeared, apps and web addresses would be unable to locate it, AP decoded. A complex DNS issue such as the one that hit the firm takes up to several hours for all the platforms to work properly on every network.

The Indian Premier League platform is an idle opportunity for youngsters to sharpen their cricketing skills while rubbing shoulders with the very best in the business. While Chennai Super Kings skipper MS Dhoni has been seen interacting with the youngsters, RCB skipper Virat Kohli too followed his former skipper's footstep and has been sharing advice with the youngsters during IPL 2021.  The advice given by one of the best cricketers in international cricket worked magic for some of the youngsters who went on to score a half-century the very next match. Here's a look at the three youngsters who benefitted from Virat Kohli's advice during the IPL 2021. The tall left-hander made his IPL debut against Royal Challengers Bangalore and from there, went on to cement his place in KKR Playing XI courtesy of some outstanding knock with the bat so far. The biggest moment in a youngsters life came when he got a chance to interact with RCB skipper Virat Kohli. After a smashing 41 run knock against RCB, Venkatesh Iyer was seen getting some advice from Virat Kohli.  The advice seemed to work for the youngster who scored half-century (53 runs) against Mumbai Indians in the next match. Yashasvi Jaiswal has had a good IPL 2021 tournament so far and is currently the third-highest run-getter Rajasthan Royals in the tournament. The youngster had a mixed start to the second leg and against RCB he had scored 31 runs from 27 balls. The Royals lost the match to RCB by 7 wickets but for the youngster, the loss turned out to be a blessing in disguise as he along with some other youngsters from the team got a chance to interact with Virat Kohli. Post the interaction, Yashasvi Jaiswal scored a half-century against CSK in the match which RR won by 7 wickets. The Mumbai Indians cricketer was recently selected for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup, however, the wicketkeeper-batsman had failed to hit the strides in the initial matches of the second leg. During Mumbai Indians match against RCB Ishan Kishan scored only 9 runs and was dismissed by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal. Post the RCB vs MI match, Virat Kohli was seen consoling Ishan Kishan who was looking emotional.

Meanwhile, Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said on Twitter, ""Security forces are at the scene, and investigation is underway."" Additionally, it was reported that the attack took place at around 1:30 PM (local time). If the death toll is said to be true, it will be considered as the deadliest attack since US and NATO troops left Afghanistan at the end of August and the Taliban took control of the country. It is pertinent to mention here that on Wednesday, an explosion in Afghanistan’s Khost city killed seven and wounded 15 others. This incident took place at Mazharul Alum Madrasa, also known as Mazharul Alum religious school. As innocent civilians of Afghanistan continue to be killed, the Taliban continues to ignore the threat of ISIS in the war-torn country. TOLO news quoted Taliban's Minister of Information and Culture, Zabiullah Mujahid, who refused to recognise ISIS as a threat.  Zabiullah had said, ""We don't call Daesh a threat, but we call it a headache. It creates headaches in some places but is immediately taken out in every incident; (they) have been chased out and their sanctuaries found."" Reportedly, the Taliban claimed to have killed 3 terrorists of the ISIS-Khorasan branch earlier this week in an operation in Northern Suburb. Notably, the United States military retaliated against the ISIS-K in the aftermath of the devastating twin blasts at the Kabul Airport that claimed 13 US servicemen before America's forces pulled out."

A division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Ranjan and Justice Gautam Kumar Choudhary, who was sworn in on the same day, said that the special investigating team of CBI ought to be more accurate in furnishing the details of the investigation. The bench conducted the hearing in physical mode. The counsel for CBI informed the court that the investigation has revealed some new facts in the case. The two accused, who have been arrested, have accepted their connection with several persons who are under the CBI scanner. However, CBI deemed it too early to disclose the names as more proof is awaited. The case will be heard again on October 21. Last month, the CBI had doubled the bounty to Rs 10 lakh for 'information of importance' in the death of the judge. The 49-year-old district judge was allegedly hit by a heavy autorickshaw after it veered towards him when he was out jogging on a wide road near Randhir Verma Chowk in Dhanbad on July 28. The auto-rickshaw had fled the scene immediately after the incident. Meanwhile, the state government informed the court that it will complete all pending appointments in the Forensic State Laboratory within six months. Necessary funds required will also be released within this time to complete the appointments, the government pleader said. The court fixed a three-month deadline to finish all pending appointments and vacant posts in the laboratory and cautioned that strict orders will be passed if the government fails to meet the deadline.

The Ashes, as it stands, is scheduled to get underway on Wednesday, December 8 at The Gabba in Brisbane.  Earlier, the England Cricket Board was uncertain if the Ashes 2021 will happen, given Australia's strict quarantine and bio-bubble policies and players' reluctance to travel without their families. However, after several discussions between the ECB and Cricket Australia, the Australia vs England series has received a green signal from England's side.  However, no further details were given on the conditions that have been demanded and what ones have been agreed to. In the official release, the England Cricket Board mentioned that their discussion has made good progress with the aim to resolve the pending one ""in the coming days"". ""Over recent weeks we have made excellent progress in moving forward on the England men's Ashes tour. To facilitate further progress and allow a squad to be selected, the ECB board has met today and given its approval for the tour to go ahead. This decision is subject to several critical conditions being met before we travel. We look forward to the ongoing assistance from Cricket Australia in resolving these matters in the coming days."" the statement read. It, however, is quite certain that England's cricketers will be allowed with their families, as that was one of the very minimum prerequisites put in for the series to go ahead. It is also likely that the quarantine period would be a more relaxed one, unlike what it was previously stated.  The first Australia vs England Test match will be contested at the 'Gabba' Brisbane from December 8-12 with the second Test match scheduled at the Adelaide Oval from December 16-20. The historical Boxing Day and New Year’s Tests will be played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from December 26-30 with the Sydney Cricket Ground hosting the fourth test between January 5-9. The Ashes 2021 will conclude with Perth Test between January 14 and 18."

On the occasion, he also took a moment to pay tribute to the 'pioneer of Indian aviation', JRD Tata and said that his team cherishes his memories. Tata Sons won the bid for acquiring Air India on Friday, 8 October 2021, ending decades of attempts to privatize a debt-laden airline, and potentially ending years of taxpayer bailouts that kept it running. Tata Sons, which had originally launched the airline in 1932, placed a winning bid of ₹ 18,000 crores to re-acquire Air India, said Tuhin Kanta Pandey, the top bureaucrat at the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management.  The company will take on Rs 15,300 crore of Air India's debt, which currently stands at Rs 61,562 crore. The remaining Rs 46,262 crore of debt will be retained by a company that will be spun off, called AIHL which will continue to be owned by the Government. The transaction is expected to be completed by December 2021.  Industrialist Ratan Tata also reacted to the news that Tata Group finally won the bid to reacquire Air India. Taking to Twitter, he said Tatas will have the opportunity to regain the image and reputation that the airlines enjoyed in earlier years. Remembering JRD Tata, under whose leadership Air India had gained the reputation as the most 'prestigious' airline in the world, Ratan Tata said the late Indian aviator would have been overjoyed on this day.

From being shown a suspect in Gandhi’s assassination to being mocked for seeking clemency from the British crown; from being called a divider of society to even projected as the main cause behind Muslim fears and subsequent formation of Pakistan, Savarkar’s image has been hostage to the vice-like grip of left world view on India’s history writing. Hence, it is no surprise that an entire generation has come up with hardly any awareness of Savarkar’s true contributions to the freedom struggle and modern India’s nation-building thoughts.  Against this backdrop, a new book has come up with the avowed objective of retrieving Savarkar’s life and times from this negative portrayal and present a true picture of the scale of his achievements for the present generation. Authored by right-wing scholar and veteran journalist Uday Mahurkar, along with Savarkarite scholar Chirayu Pandit, the book – Veer Savarkar: The Man Who Could Have Prevented Partition – puts the portrayal on its head. The authors seek to correct the wrongs of Savarkar’s portrayal, pushing the thesis that a broad acceptance of Savarkar’s world view during the freedom struggle could have prevented partition, and post-independence his doctrines would have made India a hard power and not the soft state it has remained for much of the time. Savarkar believed in Hindu-Muslim unity within a broad framework of civilizational Hindu ethos that equally applied to Muslim citizens of India with Hindu ancestry. The authors see in the Uri and Balakot surgical strikes, as also an abrogation of article 370 Savarkar’s national security doctrine in action. The building of this counter-narrative is based on marshaling facts and bringing to light stories and events that have been deliberately hidden from the mass readership. It has been a sort of shadow banning of Savarkar in India’s history writing that the authors seek to correct.  An earlier attempt at salvaging Savarkar in the biography by Padma Vibhushan Dhananjay Keer had achieved some success, but it was felt that the book ended up pulling the other way, romanticizing the leader by positing him as a revolutionary who could do no wrong. That aspect is also sought to be corrected by presenting some hard facts and scrutinizing Savarkar’s frailties as well.  It is a commonly held belief that Savarkar was a suspect in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, acquitted only for want of evidence. The book by Mahurkar and Pandit presents a provocative thought that Savarkar was a sad and broken man for this charge to have come on him. The two leaders had only met twice, both encounters being amicable, even appreciative of each other. There was no personal prejudice despite ideological differences. When talking about Gandhi, Savarkar would always address him as ‘Mahatmaji’. In 1943, when Gandhi went on a 21-day fast, Savarkar sent a telegram to Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru saying, ‘Mahatma Gandhi’s life is not so much his own as it is a national asset. Nuggets like this go against the grain of Congress history that implicated him as conspirer of Gandhi's assassination. The Mahatma, on a visit to Ratnagiri in 1927, where Savarkar was working on social causes like untouchability under British restrictions, even praised the efforts.  The book pushes the envelope even further and claims that Ambedkar met Savarkar, and strongly sympathized with the Hindutva leader when he was implicated falsely in Gandhi's assassination. How many people know, for example, that to underscore his support to Savarkar, Ambedkar went and sat through the court proceedings with his wife on the front row, when the trial was on! There were other subjects on which the two leaders had a meeting of minds, most notably on untouchability and the question of Pakistan. Ambedkar, like Savarkar, believed that Pakistan sentiment was a product of appeasement. Perhaps it was the influence of Savarkar that made Ambedkar convert to Buddhism within the Indic stream of faiths, and not choose Christianity or Islam.  It is received wisdom that Bhagat Singh was a died in the wool communist revolutionary. Now imagine if the revolutionary drew his inspiration in good measure from the Hindutva icon and even met him once! This is what Mahurkar and Pandit tell us in the book, again based on proper historical research and honest interpretation of events. The authors go on to debunk the left’s ownership of Bhagat Singh, suggesting that it’s an intellectual sleight committed by Marxists to whom the Congress party outsourced history writing in independent India. No manuscript is available of the essay ‘Why I Am An Atheist’ attributed to the revolutionary. When Bhagat Singh went to the gallows, he had a book on Lenin with him making leftists claim his ownership. They ignore four other books that were in possession of the young freedom fighter which included one each on Guru Gobind Singh and Maharana Pratap, apart from a Heer-Ranjha romance! For that matter, even Savarkar taught Lenin to his followers as the revolutionaries saw in him an inspiration against imperialism.  But the most unimpeachable evidence of the fact that Bhagat Singh drew inspiration from Savarkar and understood his spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is a large family) is found in Bhagat’s own writings. In his article titled ‘Vishwa Prem’, which appeared in a magazine called Matwala on 22 November 1924, Bhagat Singh says, ‘We describe Savarkar as an arch anarchist and vitriolic revolutionary but ultimately he was a brave believer in world brotherhood,” the book informs. Bhagat Singh quoted Savarkar six times from his book Hindu Pad-Padshahi in his jail diaries!  Mani Shankar Aiyar was the latest Congress leader to indulge in the calumny of calling Savarkar a coward for seeking clemency from the British crown to end his incarceration in Cellular Jail. This the authors say is a selective interpretation of the clemency petitions. For one, Savarkar sought clemency for all revolutionaries who were with him in the jail in Andaman Island. Two, in doing so Savarkar was borrowing from the guerrilla book of his inspiration Chatrapati Shivaji. The Maratha strongman had used a similar ruse to get out of the clutches of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb so that he could continue his struggle against the foreign rule. Savarkar clearly saw his clemency petitions from the prism of guerrilla war, a sort of deceiving tactic to achieve the larger objectives. As soon as he was out, he continued with his behind-the-scenes revolutionary activities, this time educating and training other revolutionaries. He was suspected of being involved as a conspirator in many assassinations, most famously of a British sergeant by Vaman Rao Chavan.  Savarkar did not eat Muslims for breakfast. He saw a great mass of the Muslim population with Hindu ancestors as an integral part to Indian citizenry. For him, Hindutva was not about Hindu supremacy, but Hindu protection, and equality of all faiths. His Hindutva was compatible with the ‘one man, one vote’ principle which even the secular Congress party sacrificed in accepting the separatist communal award, and earlier with the Lucknow pact conceding separate Muslim electorates. Savarkar had his list of true Muslim heroes such as the Telugu Muslim general of the Marathas, Ibrahim Khan Gardi, the great medieval Muslim ruler of Kashmir, Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin, Emperor Akbar, his great-grandson and the great Muslim symbol of syncretic culture, Dara Shukoh, Bahadur Shah Zafar and Emperor Shah Alam II. Authors believe this medieval model can be found in modern history as well in the names of great revolutionary Ashfaqullah Khan, Brigadier Mohammed Usman, Havaldar Abdul Hamid and Indian army soldier Aurangzeb, who was killed by terrorists last year in Kashmir.   For Savarkar, Hindutva was a lived history, a civilizational memory of the life of the land with a collective of Indic faiths. Thus, bringing in the strongly held RSS belief according to which all peoples of the land of Bharat, including Muslims, who trace their ancestry to this land, are Hindus. The authors want this debated whether this is divisive or an attempt at finding a golden mean, a way out of the Hindu-Muslim problematique.  From predicting the China war in 1954, eight years before it happened to the warning in 1941 on demographics of Assam’s Brahmaputra valley, to prognosticating the Kashmir conflict, Savarkar was prophetic and could be called the father of India’s national security, according to the authors. They back these claims with copious quotes from Savarkar’s writings, statements, and comments he made during his lifetime. The book has insights like Savarkar played a role in convincing Netaji Bose to travel to Japan and join the axis powers against the British to make India independent. Savarkar reprimanded Nehru for his soft approach and could see the imperatives of a hard state in India’s geostrategic neighbourhood. He wanted hard power to replace Nehru’s soft approach on both China and Pakistan, something that is being done under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. From the Uri and Balakot surgical strikes to abrogation of article 370, the authors see Savarkar’s national security doctrine in action.  Hindi words such as ‘Doordarshan’ for ‘television’, ‘Mahapour’ for ‘mayor’, and ‘Paarshad’ for ‘municipal councilor’ were coined by Savarkar. It is a pity and a measure of the intellectual bankruptcy in the country that so little is known about the true contribution of such a multifaceted personality and patriot as Savarkar. Mahurkar and Pandit have taken a deep dive to retrieve Savarkar from the image trap of both a reactionary revolutionary and a pusillanimous divider of society. It is hoped that the book would not only correct a historical wrong but would also make Savarkar attractive to a modern generation of patriots. "

With a lot of hopes pinned on both the players especially with their selection to the T20 World Cup, their lacklustre form became a cause for worry, with reports suggesting that the players would definitely be a part of the discussion when the selectors and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) meet for a final time to sit down again and discuss any changes to the World Cup squad.  However, the duo have resurrected themselves during October 8's MI vs SRH encounter with brilliant knocks. Ishan Kishan has already got himself to a bit of a form during Mumbai Indian's recent fixture against the Rajasthan Royals, scoring a 25-ball 50, and today firepowered the fastest 50 by any Mumbai Indians batsman in the history of the IPL and went on to make 84 runs.  Suryakumar Yadav, on the other hand, played out an entertaining innings, scoring a 40-ball 82 to propel the Mumbai Indians to 235/9, its highest score in IPL history. With this knock, Suryakumar Yadav also achieved his highest individual total in the IPL, overtaking his best of 79 (not out) which he made last year at this very venue.  This innings from both Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav brings a sigh of relief for several fans who were concerned about the duo being a part of the squad for the T20 World Cup. And now, it does look certain that with their performance tonight, both the players have cast aside people's doubts on their place in the mega event.

The CSMIA had alleged that the surge at the Mumbai airport was observed due to the festive season and thus it consequently resulted in delays in passenger processing. The incident occurred at Terminal 2 of the Mumbai airport, which saw unprecedented weekend crowds. The delays were surged due to the intelligence alerts provided to the airport security, due to which they had to adopt ‘heightened security measures’. Along with this, the mandate to follow COVID-19 protocols added to the delay in proceedings, the airport authority said.

To avert such incidents in the future and ensure the smooth functioning of the airport, several measures have been taken by CSMIA. The new measures were taken keeping in mind the security protocols, the CSMIA said in a statement. 1) Instead of the previously anticipated 20 October resumption, Terminal 1 operations will resume function on October 13 with Go First flights, followed by Air Asia on October 16. 2) As an urgent solution to passenger congestion, additional employees will be deployed to handle the intake of passengers at the Security Handling Area (SHA). 3) Over the following four days, new X-ray equipment will be installed to screen travellers'  bags more quickly. 4) Requested airlines that they shall advise passengers to arrive early and check-in their cabin luggage to avoid delays at security checkpoints.
  Earlier in the day, a CSMIA spokesperson said, “With the onset of the festive season, there has been a surge in passenger traffic and a sudden spike witnessed at CSMIA this morning. Similar experiences have also been witnessed in other city airports of the country. Further owing to recent intelligence reports received by stakeholders and threat at another airport in the state, security measures have been further enhanced at CSMIA."""

With this move, the government is not just dispensing of a cash drain but also renewing its faith in the potential efficiency of the private sector, he said. Notably, the government was bearing a loss of Rs 20 crore daily to keep the national carrier flying.  Tata Sons was selected as the winning bidder for Air India, ending decades of attempts to privatize a debt-laden airline, and potentially ending years of taxpayer bailouts that kept it running. Tata Sons, which had originally launched the airline in 1932, placed a winning bid of ₹ 18,000 crores to re-acquire Air India, said Tuhin Kanta Pandey, the top bureaucrat at the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management. The company will take on Rs 15,300 crore of Air India's debt, which currently stands at Rs 61,562 crore. The remaining Rs 46,262 crore of debt will be retained by a company that will be spun off, called AIHL which will continue to be owned by the Government. The government aims to complete the transaction by December 2021.  Industrialist Ratan Tata also reacted to the news that Tata Group has finally won the bid to reacquire Air India. Taking to Twitter, he said Tatas will have the opportunity to regain the image and reputation that the airlines enjoyed in earlier years. Remembering JRD Tata, under whose leadership Air India had gained the reputation as the most 'prestigious' airline in the world, Ratan Tata said the late Indian aviator would have been overjoyed on this day.  The former general manager of the national carrier G Prasada Rao also hoped that Tatas will bring the ""glorious years"" of the airlines back. ""With Tata at the helm, Air India's history, legacy, and future come full circle and it will once again stand tall in its full might and glory. We should thank our Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Group of Ministers lead by (Home Minister) Amit Shah for successfully implementing the process. We hope and wish the Tatas will bring the glorious years back!"" he added."

Citing that there was no benefit of privatizing the air carrier company, as there was still over Rs 45,000 crore debt retained by the Government of India, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate asked, ""What did the government gain by this?"" In the bidding for Air India, in total seven bids were received, of which 5 did not qualify. The bids that made the cut were that of Tata Sons and Ajay Singh, the promoter of SpiceJet. Tata Sons placed the winning bidding at Rs.18,000 crore. Air India's debt currently stands at Rs 61,562 crore. Of this, Tata Sons will retain Rs 15,300 crore worth debt while the remaining Rs 46,262 crore of debt will be retained by a company that will be spun off, called AIHL, which will continue to be owned by the Government.  It is pertinent to mention here that Congress in 2019 had posed in front of the BJP-led Central government about the future of Air India. Taking to their official Twitter handle, the party had asked, ""How much longer will the govt fund a loss-making airline with taxpayers' money knowing its accumulated losses are increasing every year?"" Today, reposting the tweet, the BJP Twitter handle answered the question saying, ""Modi Government: Cleaning the mess created by successive Congress governments, which were too incompetent to solve any problems themselves."" With the winning bid of Rs.18,000 crore, apart from a 100% stake in Air India and its low-cost arm - Air India Express, a 50% stake in ground-handling company Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited (AISAT) will also come into the ownership of Tata Group."

According to a statement, Hindu organizations such as the Bajrang Dal and the VHP would stage protests across the country on October 9 in which they will burn effigies representing Pakistan’s terror regime. VHP said, ""the best way to end Islamic terrorism in J&K is to safely rehabilitate the exiled Kashmiri Hindus and provide them free mobility in the valley”. Condemning the brutal killing of civilians, VHP's Central General Secretary Milind Parande expressed deep concern about the Hindus being targeted in the valley. He urged the Central government to take coercive steps to tackle 'Islamic Jihadists' spreading their tentacles in Kashmir. The organization also suggested the rehabilitation of the indigenous Hindu migrants back to the valley, calling it the best way to curb terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. Milind Parande warned that the ill-fated attempt to break India’s unity and integrity will fail miserably and that Hindu organizations will respond appropriately to such attempts. Since October 2, at least seven people have been killed by terrorists in Kashmir, including four minorities. Six of the deaths took place in Srinagar itself.   A woman principal and a teacher were shot dead at point-blank range inside a government school in Srinagar on Thursday. Supinder Kaur, the principal of the Government Boys Higher Secondary School, and Deepak Chand were gunned down around at the school premises. Meanwhile, Makhan Lal Bindroo, a prominent Kashmiri Pandit and owner of Srinagar's most famous pharmacy, was shot dead at his shop on Tuesday. A 'chaat' vendor, Virendra Paswan from Bihar, and another civilian, Mohammad Shafi Lone, were also killed on Tuesday in Srinagar and in Bandipora respectively. On Saturday, terrorists shot dead Majid Ahmad Gojri in Srinagar and Mohammad Shafi Dar at Batmaloo. According to official statistics, a total of 28 civilians were killed by terrorists so far in 2021.

Former Law Minister Ashwani Kumar said the observation of the top Court constitutes a severe indictment of the way the UP government was investigating the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. He added that the court's observation expresses concern regarding a fair investigation in the case. Earlier on Friday, the apex court stated that it was not satisfied with the steps taken by the Uttar Pradesh government in the investigation of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. The court directed the government to apprise the court of an alternative agency that can conduct the probe.  The top court also ruled out the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe as an alternative, because of reasons known to the state government. Taking suo-motu cognisance of the tragedy, the apex court said that eight persons were brutally murdered in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 and the law must take its course against all accused. The SC further said that it hoped that the UP government would take necessary steps due to the sensitivity of the issue. On Tuesday, advocates Shiv Kumar Tripathi and CS Panda had written to the top court, demanding action against politicians allegedly involved in the ghastly incident. ""Having regard to the seriousness of the killing of the farmers at district Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, it is incumbent upon this Court to intervene in the matter as flashed in the press,"" the letter stated. As many as eight people died in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that shook the state earlier this week. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of several farmer unions has alleged that Union Minister of Home Ajay Mishra Teni's son Ashish Mishra arrived with three vehicles when farmers were dispersing from their protest at the helipad and mowed down farmers. However, Ashish Mishra has refuted the allegations, denying that he was present at the spot where the incident took place. "

A group of Ministers (GoM), headed by Home Minister Amit Shah, reconstituted the panel named Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) which was first formed in 2017 and headed by then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Shah ratified the winning bid along with other members of AISAM, namely, Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal.  Marking the third attempt of the Government of India (GoI) to get rid of the decade-long loss-incurring air carrier, the salt-to-software conglomerate placed a winning bid of ₹ 18,000 crores to re-acquire the airline more than 65 years after it ceded control to the government. The Tata Group – which owns stakes in Vistara airlines and Air Asia has been eyeing to bring Air India back into Tata's folds for a long time. Air India, which was founded by J.R.D. Tata, a licenced pilot, in 1932, had been operating a few mail carriers in the 1930s between Karachi in then undivided and British-ruled India and Bombay. The Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), Tuhin Kant Pandey, laid out salient pointers of the deal as Tatasons’ SPV – Talace Pvt Ltd – wins the bid for Air India.  Air India was taken over by GoI in 1953 after the air carrier was nationalised. While JRD Tata was initially made head of Air India's board, he was later dropped from the re-constituted board of both Air India and Indian Airlines in 1978 - an incident that still stings the Tatas. Notably, Tata Sons, the holding company and owner of British luxury automobile manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, managed to acquire the brand subsequent to PM Modi's bold privatisation plan to prevent a stretched budget deficit.  Upon translating into a government-owned commercial carrier in the 1940s, Air India rapidly emerged popular among the affluent and contrary to today's branding, its advertisements and promotion featured Bollywood actresses while passengers on board were served expensive champagnes and designer-made porcelain ashtrays, as per archived reports.  However, of late after Gulf and other private domestic brands started to order cheaper tickets en routes to Europe and the US via layovers in Middle East Asia, Air India suffered losses. Considering the conglomerate holds major shares in AirAsia India and Vistara which is a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd, Air India has not earned a profit since 2007, after its merger with Indian Airlines. The Tata group can take advantage of the reputation it carries and other assets it possesses, such as Vistara's designated landing and parking spaces at London's Heathrow."

In yet another political brawl, Karanataka BJP on Friday posted a picture of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi & Priyanka Gandhi Vadra meeting the family members of the deceased farmers who lost their lives in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident.  In a tweet, the Karnataka BJP brought up the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in India, which was followed after the assassination of Indira Gandhi in which thousands of Sikhs lost their lives across the country. Asking if the Gandhis will apologize for the 1984 massacre, the BJP wrote, “ Families of 1984 Sikh Genocide are still waiting for the Fake Gandhis to apologise for the brutalities inflicted on them. Will Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi apologize to these families?”
  The BJP shared the tweet along with a picture of the Gandhi siblings consoling the family of the Sikh protestor who lost his life in the Lakhimpur-Kheri incident.  The BJP’s attack on Congress comes after Karnataka Congress President DK Shivakumar lashed out at the saffron party on the ongoing allegations on MoS Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Misra, of running over his vehicle on the protesting farmers and killing them.  DK Shivakumar, Kanakapura MLA, took a jibe at BJP and appealed to the people to record videos whenever BJP leaders' cars passed through them, alleging that BJP leaders might ‘run over people’ whenever they want to. He did not mince his words and further added that the video recorded by citizens can be used as evidence against such crimes committed by BJP leaders. He further said that the video will be a service to the nation. The video appeal by Shivakumar was a direct attack on MoS Misra and his son’s alleged involvement in the case. After arresting two people and detaining three others, UP police summoned Ashish Mishra in connection with the case on Thursday, sparking widespread anger. The autopsy report confirmed that the deceased had no gunshot injuries, yet fired shells were recovered from the scene. Under IPC Sections 120B, 147, 148, 149, 279, 302, 304A, and 338, Ashish Mishra and 15-20 other unidentified individuals have been booked. Mishra's current whereabouts are unclear, although UP Leader of the Opposition Akhilesh Yadav claims he has fled to Nepal. Four farmers were brutally mowed down by an SUV in Lakhimpur Kheri while returning from a protest against the Centre's three new farm laws. The demonstration was staged against the visit of UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on 3 October. Along with the four farmers, it was reported that two BJP workers were also beaten to death by angry protesters."

In a subtle dig at the INC, Kishor had stated that people who are expecting a 'quick, spontaneous revival' of the Congress-led Opposition based on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident are in for a 'big disappoinment'. He also asserted that there are no 'quick fix solutions' for the deep-rooted problems and structural weakness within the party.  Bhupesh Baghel has now hit back at the election strategist, whose company I-PAC is creating a roadmap for the Trinamool Congress to defeat BJP at the national level.  He was referring to the recent induction of ex-Goa Chief Minister Luizinho Faleiro into the TMC. The senior Congress leader was reportedly approached by Prashant Kishor, which inspired his decision to switch loyalties. Baghel accused Mamata Banerjee's party of poaching Congress leaders in election-going states when she failed to retain her own Nandigram seat against BJP's Suvendu Adhikari.   Prashant Kishor's comment on the Congress came months after there were reports indicating that he might join the party. Back in July, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had also held a meeting with top leaders Ambika Soni, KC Venugopal, and AK Antony to discuss Prashant Kishor's induction. Moreover, Rahul Gandhi had met Prashant Kishor at least three times in a span of one week to discuss the revival of Congress."

The Andhra Pradesh CM in a letter drafted to PM Modi stated that the unfolding International crisis has resulted in a three-fold increase in the electricity charges across Europe and China while further deeming that the crisis has now hit India. ""In Andhra Pradesh, the post-COVID power demand increased by 15% in the last six months and by 20% in the last one month, coupled with coal shortage is pushing the country's energy sector into turmoil,"" the draft maintained. ""The daily average market price of about 40 MU/day energy that we purchase has increased 3 times from a daily average of Rs 4.6 per kWh on 15th September to a daily average of Rs 15 per kWh on 8th October 2021,"" CM Reddy asserted. The Chief Minister emphasised that the state has been facing a shortage in electricity distribution as the Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation (APGENCO) has fallen short of coal stocks. ""AP has been meeting a grid demand of about 185-190 MU daily. Power generation stations operated by APGENCO which supplies 45% of the state's energy needs, hardly have coal stocks for 1 or 2 days and generation from these could be impacted further,"" Reddy maintained. The Andhra Pradesh CM also highlighted the need for additional water supply during the harvesting season that comes at the cost of huge energy supply. CM Reddy talked about the unavailability of power in the state during certain hours citing the situation as 'alarming'. ""Power is also not available at certain hours in the market due to less availability of generation in the country. It is a quite alarming situation and the finances of distribution companies would deteriorate further if the situation persists,"" the AP CM stated in his letter to PM Modi. CM Reddy submitted a list of measures to be taken by the Centre along with the state to avert chaotic conditions arising due to load shedding.  The CM among many other measures urged PM Modi to direct the Coal Ministry and the Railways to allot 20 coal rakes to thermal stations in Andhra Pradesh. He also urged the Prime Minister to provide the deepwater gas available with ONGC and Reliance to be supplied on an emergency basis to 2300 MV stranded/nonworking gas plants in the state. Image: PTI"

Wishing him the very best for his future endeavours, PM Modi said he was delighted to have collaborated with Subramanian. ""It's been a delight to work with KV Subramanian. His academic brilliance, unique perspectives on key economic as well as policy matters, and reformist zeal are noteworthy.

During his career, Subramanian has also been a part of the expert committees for the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). He is well-versed with the private sector with brief stints in top corporates including JPMorgan Chase, ICICI Bank, and Tata Consultancy Services.

Congress is not only plagued with desertion from its rank and file, but one of its oldest allies, the RJD, has also started questioning the leadership of the Congress and its support base. National Vice President of RJD, Shivanand Tiwari in an exclusive interview to Republic TV  has termed Congress a 'weak party' and suggested to its high command to introspect & diagnose the mass exodus from the party as well as the party's waning support base. After the exodus of senior leaders from the Congress party, Kapil Sibal and Ghulam Nabi Azad raised questions and asked for the overhauling of the organization. RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari echoed the sentiments of the senior Congress leaders. Congress has lost its support base in many states. In the recently held Bengal assembly polls, Congress failed to open its account. Speaking on the same, Shivanand Tiwari said, ""The Congress is in a direct fight against the BJP on 200 Lok Sabha seats, but on the rest of the seats it has to put the regional parties on the driving seat. Congress is weak in Bihar, Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and few other states. When Mandal commission was implemented, Rajiv Gandhi opposed it, which led to the Congress party being wiped out in the Hindi belt ."" In the 2021 assembly polls, RJD had contested Tarapur, and Congress contested on Kushehwarasthan assembly constituency as a part of the alliance. But considering the weak support base of the Congress in Bihar, RJD has fielded candidates for both the assembly by-polls being held on 30th October, leading to a war of words between Congress and RJD. Tejashwi Yadav led the RJD from the front during the Bihar assembly polls in the absence of his father Lalu Yadav. Shivanand Tiwari, while praising Tejashwi said that ""He has the trait of a big leader and he has proven his worth. He set the narrative of employment in Bihar polls which Nitish Kumar and BJP had to follow "". The drifting support base in the majority of the states and the mass exodus is an alarm bell for the Congress party. Young and trusted leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasad have already left the party, while Sachin Pilot despite all his hard work in Rajasthan has been cold-shouldered. There is a growing restlessness among the party leaders regarding the future of the party. Taking cognizance, G23 leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad & Kapil Sibal have spoken up to revamp the party. The mishandling in Punjab has also done no good to the Congress leadership. Now, with allies like RJD losing confidence, it is not a good sign for Congress. But the RJD should also not discount the national presence of Congress in Bihar. Lalu Yadav committed the same mistake of not giving a single seat to the Congress party in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, despite Lalu being a part of the UPA1 govt.  Congress and RJD fought against each other with RJD winning 4 seats and Congress winning 2 seats. Congress formed the UPA govt and Lalu Yadav was not accommodated in the Union Government despite winning Lok Sabha elections from Saran. In 2013, Rahul Gandhi fell out with Lalu and moved the anti-corruption bill, and Lalu Yadav lost his Lok Sabha membership after being convicted in the fodder scam. Is History repeating itself and has Tejashwi Yadav made the same mistake that his father made in 2009?"

As per reports, the Uttarakhand unit of BJP has proposed at least five rallies by PM Modi, one each in five parliamentary constituencies. As the state BJP unit has also started the process of shortlisting candidates for the upcoming polls, another BJP leader was quoted by the news agency saying, ""There would be two reports, one will be given by the state and there will be another survey done by the Centre. They become MLA because of organisation and that is why works were given by the organisation like social work during the COVID-19 pandemic and works done under the 'Sewa hi Sangathan' campaign will be considered as well. However, winnability will be the deciding factor."" Uttarakhand is all set to go into polls next year in February to elect 70 members of the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly. The term of the current assembly which was elected in 2017 will expire on March 23, 2022. There are estimations regarding the victory of BJP in the State Assembly elections thus leading to the defeat of Congress.  Independent MLA from Uttarakhand's Bhimtal assembly, Ram Singh Kaira joined Bhartiya Janata Party on Friday. He joined BJP in the presence of Union Minister Smriti Irani along with Uttarakhand state in-charge and Rajya Sabha member Dushyant Gautam, Uttarakhand BJP state president Madan Kaushik and Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni at the party headquarters in Delhi.

Pandey became the third player to lead SRH this season after the surprising removal of David Warner from the post earlier this year. Williamson has reportedly been ruled out of the match due to some worries, however, the decision has not gone down well with fans, who have now taken to social media to troll SRH management. 
Netizens are sharing memes on Twitter to troll SRH for appointing a third skipper in a single edition of the IPL.  When Manish Pandey came out for the toss, he etched his name in IPL record books for becoming the player with most matches before making his captaincy debut. Pandey had played 153 IPL games before he made his captaincy debut for SRH. The record was earlier held by Mumbai Indians' Kieron Pollard, who had played 137 matches before making his captaincy debut in 2019. Manish had played 7 matches in the ongoing edition of IPL before being named the captain of SRH. He was dropped from the side after the resumption of the second leg in UAE due to poor form.

The Royal Challengers Bangalore had to score around 200 runs and win by a margin of 163 runs. However, after winning the toss, Kohli decided to bowl first against the Delhi Capitals.

Earlier on Thursday, he stated that unless action is taken against MoS Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra, he will sit at the residence of the deceased on a hunger strike. Apart From Raman Kashyap, at least seven people, including protesting farmers were killed during the violence.  On Thursday, Navjot Singh Sidhu along with other leaders were detained while marching towards Lakhimpur Kheri. A large number of party leaders including ministers, legislators, and workers first assembled at Mohali and then marched towards Lakhimpur Kheri. Before they could reach Lakhimpur, they were detained near Saharanpur by the Uttar Pradesh Police. From Saharanpur, they were taken to Sarsawa Police Station. Sidhu had said, ""MoS has been left free, is its father rule of law? He added, ""We don't attack from behind, Ashish Mishra drove on them from behind. Beat us up, we will faint, die but won't move back an inch. If UP police can leave Mos Mishra free even after murder then we can be left free as well."" The Supreme Court on Friday pulled up the Uttar Pradesh government for not arresting accused Ashish Mishra in the Lakhimpur violence case. A division bench of CJI NV Ramana, Justices Surya Kant, and Hima Kohli was hearing a plea based on the letter written by advocates Shiv Kumar Tripathi and CS Panda. Appearing for the UP government, Queen's Counsel Harish Salve stressed that the rigors of law will be applied against Mishra if he doesn't turn up before the police at 11 am on October 9 as per the notice. Observing that Mishra has been charged under IPC Section 302, the CJI said that he should be treated like any other person accused in a murder case. On October 3, while farmers were protesting against the three Farm Laws at Lakhimpur Kheri outside an event venue where Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya was scheduled to be present, one of the farmers was shot dead by Union MoS Ajay Misra Teni's son Ashish Misra and two farmers were killed after his car ran over them. Before the killings, the protesters were seen holding black flags against Maurya's arrival at Maharaja Agrasen Ground. After the incident, farmers started stone-pelting at the car which had overturned, killing 4 people - including Misra's driver.

He demanded that the prime minister meet with farmers, travel to Lakhimpur Kheri, and meet with the families of slain farmers. The Dalit politician compared the Lakhimpur Kheri tragedy to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, claiming that it will have far-reaching consequences in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Azad claimed that there is no law and order in Uttar Pradesh and demanded that the CM resign. He also backed the need for a caste census, claiming that it would help determine the percentage of society's marginalised groups. In the latest development in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, India's Minister of State for Home Affairs (MOS) Ajay Mishra arrived in Lucknow on Friday and is expected to visit Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. As soon as Ajay Mishra stepped out of the airport, a swarm of media personnel encircled the Minister and questioned him about the opposition parties' call for resignation. Ashish Mishra Teni, son of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra Teni, allegedly arrived with three vehicles around the time farmers were dispersing from their demonstration at the helipad, and mowed down farmers, eventually attacking SKM leader Tajinder Singh Virk personally by attempting to run a vehicle over him, according to the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella organisation for numerous farmer unions. SKM's claims, however, were rejected by Ashish Mishra, who stated that he was not present at the scene of the incident.  Up to eight people were killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident on Sunday, according to Uttar Pradesh police. MoS Teni further stated that his son was not present at the scene and that miscreants mixed with protesting farmers and threw stones at the car, resulting in the 'unfortunate incident.'"

In an indirect attack at his brother Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap said in a tweet that his exclusion was okay but not that of their mother Rabri Devi and sister Misa Bharati. Tej Pratap added that for this mistake, the women of Bihar will never forgive.  'During Dussehra, we worship the women, don't we?' Tej Pratap further said in a tweet uploaded on his official handle, a day after the RJD released its list of campaigners for the upcoming by-polls. While RJD supremo Lalu Yadav topped the list of campaigners, his wife and serving MLC Rabri Devi did not find a spot. Also, not finding a spot was their elder son Tej Pratap and daughter Misa Bharati while the younger son, Tejashwi Yadav was on the second position in the list.  Speaking exclusively to Republic Media Network, National Vice President of RJD, Shivanand Tiwary tried to justify the exclusion of prominent faces of the party from the star campaigners list. ""Many have not been made star campaigners. I don't think it matters anyway. Even I haven't been included in the list."" The 20 names in the star campaigner list include Lalu Prasad Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav, Abdulbari Siddiqui, Jayprakash Narayan Yadav, Uday Narayan Chaudhary, Shyam Rajak, Bhola Yadav, Tanveer Hassan, Trishan Patel, Lalit Kumar Yadav, Manoj Kumar Jha, Bharat Mandal, Ram Kumar Sahani, Alok Kumar Mehta, Shiv Chandra Ram, Lovely Anand, Chandrahas Chaupal, Bharat Bind, Ramvraksh Sada, Anil Kumar urf Sadhu Paswan. It all started when Tej Pratap called Jagadanand Singh, the RJD chief of Bihar, 'a Hitler.'  Jagadanand Singh, taking offence to the reference, decided to quit the party post but after the intervention of Lalu Yadav, changed his decision and rejoined office. After rejoining office, Jagadanand Singh nominated Gagan Kumar as president of RJD in Chhatra, replacing Aakash Yadav, a close aide of Tej Pratap. This decision, which was taken after a discussion with Tejashwi, miffed Tej Pratap, who started demanding Jagadanand Singh's ouster from the presidentship of the party in Bihar.  Tej Pratap, to convince Tejashwi, visited their Patna-based home, but within a few minutes walking out fuming, alleging that the meeting had been 'interrupted'. Displeased by Tej Pratap's behaviour and his remarks in the media, Tejashwi, who had kept mum in the matter so far, stated that Tej Pratap should be a 'little more disciplined'. ""No matter what, indiscipline is not okay. Indiscipline within the party causes trouble,"" Tejashwi had said, adding that their parents (Lalu Yadav and Rabri Devi) had not taught this to them.  Recently, Tej Pratap while addressing a training program of his newly formed outfit ""Chatra Jan shakti"" Parishad alleged that his father was being held captive in Delhi and is not being allowed to return to Patna. Attacking Tejashwi indirectly, he claimed that he is trying to replace his father as National President of RJD. However, Tejashwi dismissed the allegations. Reminding that Lalu Yadav had been Bihar's CM, Union Rail Minister, and arrested LK Advani, Tejashwi Yadav said captivity does not match Lalu ji's personality."

On Thursday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson removed the travel restrictions imposed on Indians travelling to Britain and has reversed its decision of imposing quarantine guidelines on fully vaccinated Indian citizens. Taking a U-turn on its travel policy, the UK government has permitted Indian travellers to visit the UK from October 11, 2021, 4 AM onwards. Meanwhile, as per government sources, the Centre is set to issue fresh guidelines for foreign nationals arriving from Britain.  ""The Centre will issue fresh guidelines for foreign nationals from the United Kingdom after the British government ordered to discontinue mandatory COVID norms for those vaccinated with Covishield and travelling from India to the UK,"" sources said on Friday.

The UK government had last month declared fresh guidelines making it compulsory for a 10-day quarantine and RT-PCR test even for fully vaccinated Indians traveling to the UK. Infuriated by the UK move, India in response has forced reciprocal rules for UK nationals traveling to India since October 04, 2021.

Announcing his resignation on Friday, Subramanian said serving the nation has been an absolute privilege for him while lauding the 'wonderful support and encouragement' that he received from the government.  Subramanian had taken over as the 17th CEA of India on December 7, 2018, nearly five months after his predecessor Arvind Subramanian stepped down from the post. The 50-year-old economist thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for the opportunity provided to him. Releasing a statement about his tenure as the Chief Economic Advisor, KV Subramanian said: ""I have received tremendous encouragement and support from within the Government and have been fortunate to enjoy a warm relationship with senior functionaries. In close to three decades of my professional life, I am yet to encounter a more inspiring leader than the Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri. Narendra Modiji. His intuitive understanding of economic policy combines with an unmistakable determination to use the same to elevate the lives of common citizens."" Subramanian said the momentous change in India’s economic thinking post the pandemic – inter alia embracing ethical wealth creation by empowering the private sector and economic recovery driven by the government's capital expenditure bears testimony to PM Modi's leadership. During his career, Subramanian has also been a part of the expert committees for the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). He is well-versed with the private sector with brief stints in top corporates including JPMorgan Chase, ICICI Bank, and Tata Consultancy Services. The government is yet to announce Subramanian's successor."

The SC suggested that the Union and the Delhi government should work together to find a way to ensure that education is not denied due to lack of resources. A Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna said that it is an important step under the Right to Education (RTE) Act and the Centre must also coordinate with the state government to share responsibilities for funding for resources. The Bench further said that the digital divide is the prime reason for EWS not getting their education as the majority of schools adopted the digital medium during the pandemic. The bench said, ""Digital divide produced stark consequences during the pandemic as the right to education was virtually denied to children belonging to EWS children as they could not afford computers for online classes."" The Bench insisted that the government must provide solutions or facilities. The Bench added, ""The needs of young children who are future of the country cannot be ignored. Access to online education to EWS and disadvantaged groups of children cannot be denied."" The Delhi High Court had directed several schools last year to provide gadgets and internet package to students from EWS and disadvantaged groups to ensure online learning. The High Court had also directed the schools that the cost of gadgets and internet package should not be added to the tuition fees. The Bench of the apex court was hearing a plea of the Action Committee Unaided Recognized Private Schools, which claimed that it was difficult for schools to provide the students with the gadgets and the internet packages as it was putting immense pressure on them financially. The Action Committee further said that the government must reimburse the schools and provide adequate funding for the same. The top court issued a notice in the matter and tagged it along with the pending appeals filed by the Central government and the Delhi government against the order of the Delhi High Court."

This comes after the central government ruled out the possibility of conducting a caste-based census this year during a hearing in the Supreme court.  The Telangana assembly wants the central government to conduct the caste census to enumerate the population of the backward classes in the state. Hence, they have passed a resolution against the centre's disapproval of the census along with the population census scheduled for this year.  State Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao had introduced the resolution in the Assembly after the question hour and the resolution was passed in the assembly without any opposition. Speaking on the bill, Rao said that nearly 50% of the state population constitutes of people from backward classes and that the Telangana govt wants to determine the same through the census. He further added that it was important for the state government to know the accurate statistics for taking required measures for the upliftment of the poor sections of the society. Several political parties have earlier reached out to the central government and had demanded the conduct of the caste-based census. Taking up the issue, a Bihar delegation led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar along with RJD opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convince the government to conduct the census.  The demand was raised by former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav along with other opposition leaders. Moreover, some BJP allies have also asserted the demand for a caste-based census, as it has not been done in several years. However, while replying to a plea in the Supreme court, the Centre in its response, had dismissed the possibility of conducting the caste survey along with the population census. The Centre, in an affidavit filed on September 21, said that the population census is not the right instrument to conduct the caste-based census. The Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment had argued in the court that it is not feasible to collect information on the Backward Class of Citizens (BCC) in the upcoming census. Image: PTI"

Addressing a brief, Ramiz Raja claimed that 50% of PCB was running on the funding of the International Cricket Council (ICC), which in turn, was largely functioning on the funds of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Given BCCI's heavy funding in ICC, Ramiz Raja feared that PCB would collapse if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to pull out the funds one day.  The video of the PCB chief's statement was shared by BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya. In the video, the PCB chief addresses the Senate Standing Committee on Inter-Provincial Coordination saying,  On Thursday, Ramiz Raja had taken to Twitter to announce that the England & Wales Cricket Board Chief had resigned from his post. As soon as Ramiz Raja broke the news of the ECB chief's resignation, netizens started grilling the PCB head. As a result, Ramiz Raja deleted his 'erroneously' tweeted statement and also apologized for the same.  England and Wales Cricket Board on Thursday informed that chairman Ian Watmore would step down with immediate effect. According to ECB, he has reached a mutual agreement with the board to step down following the end of the domestic season. Previously, Ramiz Raja had come under the limelight after he lashed out at New Zealand for cancelling their tour of Pakistan. The PCB chief had threatened the Black Caps saying that they would hear from Pakistan at the ICC for their unilateral decision. New Zealand had pulled out of its Pakistan tour owing to 'security concerns'. Days later, England followed suit and called off their three-match ODI and five-match T20I series."

Pathak, censuring the act, said that the matter is under judicial consideration and called on opposition parties to not politicize the matter. When questioned about Ashish Mishra's failure to arrive for the inquiry, Pathak said, ""The local police will know about it. But we want to assure everyone that the government is of the view that strictest punishment should be served to the culprit."" On October 3, Sunday, eight people were killed during a protest march in Lakhimpur Kheri following the violence, police confirmed. The protestors had alleged that a jeep being driven by Union Minister Ajay Mishra's son, Ashish Mishra, ran over the farmers. Meanwhile, the accused, Ashish Mishra failed to appear for the interrogation on Friday as directed by the police, the UP police said. This is the first time the UP Police has advanced to interrogate Ashish Mishra, the son of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet colleague and junior Home Minister Ajay Mishra. An FIR was filed against the accused on Monday and the police had posted a notice at the Union Minister's residence, asking his son to appear for questioning on Friday. Meanwhile, amid speculations of Ashish Mishra 'fleeing UP', his father Union MoS Ajay Mishra on Friday stated that his son will appear before the UP police's SIT on Saturday. Speaking to Republic, Mishra stated that a letter has been furnished to the police citing 'health issues' for Ashish's absence to appear before the SIT today. Sources state that Ajay Mishra is expected to meet UP CM Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow. Ashish Mishra has been accused of allegedly mowing down 4 farmers with his car in UP's Lakhimpur Kheri - a charge he has refuted. On Sunday, farmers were protesting against the Farm Laws at Lakhimpur Kheri outside an event venue where Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya was scheduled to arrive. As farmers displayed black flags along the path from the helipad to the venue, Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) claimed that one of the farmers was shot dead by Ashish Misra - son of Union MoS Ajay Misra Teni and two farmers were killed after his car ran over them and turned turtle. In retaliation, farmers resorted to pelting stones at the car, which took a turn, killing 4 BJP workers - including Misra's driver. Clashes ensued after the incident resulting in many injuries and section 144 has been imposed throughout the district. Inputs: ANI Image: PTI/ANI"

The salt-to-software conglomerate placed a winning bid of ₹ 18,000 crores to re-acquire the airline more than 65 years after it ceded control to the government. Seven bids were received in total, of which five did not meet the criteria. The bids that lasted were those of Tata Sons and Ajay Singh, the promoter of SpiceJet. The Tata Sons bid amounts to Rs 18,000 crore and will see it take on Rs 15,300 crore of Air India's debt, which currently stands at Rs 61,562 crore. The remaining Rs 46,262 crore of debt will be retained by a company that will be spun off, called AIHL which will continue to be owned by the Government. Tata Sons winning bid will entail the transfer of all non-core assets, meaning AIHL will retain ownership of the land and building assets valued at Rs 14,718 crore.  Apart from a 100 percent stake in Air India and its low-cost arm - Air India Express, the winning bid also includes a 50 percent stake in ground-handling company Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited (AISATS). The transaction is expected to close by the end of December 2021, said Tuhin Kant Pandey, Secretary, DIPAM. The acquisition marks the return of Air India to the Tatas.

Industrialist Ratan Tata on Friday reacted to the news that Tata Group has finally won the bid to reacquire Air India.

539,Fri Oct 08 11:05:11 +0000 2021,Nobel Peace Prize 2021: A look at some of the most recognisable winners of all time https://t.co/Kn2P8ELzcs,https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/global-event-news/nobel-peace-prize-2021-a-look-at-some-of-the-most-recognisable-winners-of-all-time.html,7.0,31.0,Nobel Peace Prize 2021: A Look At Some Of The Most Recognisable Winners Of All Time,"In its 120 years of history, the Nobel Peace Prize has celebrated the efforts of 109 individuals and 28 organisations. The trend of awarding the flagbearers of peace and harmony started in 1901, besides other laurels given out in the fields of Physiology or Medicine, Chemistry, Physics, Literature and Economic Sciences, which was added later. While journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov won the 2021 Nobel Peace prize, here are some of the most recognisable winners in history.  Going by the nickname ‘Madiba’ or the Father of South Africa, Nelson Mandela chose the path of peace and non-violence against an apartheid regime after being inspired by the principles of Mahatma Gandhi. He shared the 1993 peace prize with Frederik Willem de Klerk for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime and laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa. Mandela was South Africa’s first black President and rose to this position after spending 18 years in the notorious prison island Robben Island for his resistance efforts against racism.  Spiritual leader Dalai Lama, originally named Tenzin Gyatso, was awarded the peace prize in 1989 for advocating peaceful solutions based upon tolerance and mutual respect in order to preserve the historical and cultural heritage of his people. Born on 6 July 1935 in Tibet’s Taktser, Dalai Lama was in India when he won the laurel as he was exiled from his land for spearheading the nonviolent opposition to China's occupation of Tibet. A leading advocate of girls' rights, Malala won the laurel in 2014 for the struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education. She shared the prize with India’s own activist Kailash Satyarthi, known for his contributions to children’s welfare. Born in the Swat district of northwestern Pakistan, she was shot by the Taliban gunmen in 2012 while on a school bus, for opening up against the Taliban's growing influence in the region to the foreign media. Barack Obama, who served as the 44th US President, won the peace prize in 2009 “for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples”. The Nobel committee stated that Obama’s strong advocacy for human rights, democracy, and disarmament helped him win the prize.  This Nobel laureate became a global figure after a military coup happened earlier this February during her rule in Myanmar. However, she carries a global portfolio as she won the peace prize in 1991 “for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights."" A Delhi University alumna, Suu Kyi was born on 19 June 1945, in modern-day Burma and is the daughter of the legendary liberation movement leader Aung San. "

Three civilians were killed by terrorists on Tuesday following which two school teachers were shot dead in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday.  Responding to People's Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti's remarks on civilians' killings in Jammu and Kashmir, Indresh Kumar stated that some parties and political leaders in Kashmir always highlight anti-India, pro-Pakistan, and pro-China comments in their statements.  With reference to the killing of three civilians, the PDP chief had tweeted, ""Condemn the killing of Shri M L Bindroo who chose to stay back in Kashmir even during peak insurgency. Such acts of violence have no place in our society. May his family find the strength to deal with this loss."" On October 5, within a span of 60 minutes, three civilians in Jammu and Kashmir were killed in separate terrorist attacks. As per the Kashmir Zone Police reports, the first terrorist attack occurred in Srinagar's Iqbal Park area, then near Madina Chowk Lalbazar, and lastly at Bandipora district. Reportedly, the Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba as per the J&K Police, has claimed responsibility for the attack near Srinagar's Iqbal Park where a Kashmiri pandit was killed. In the second attack, a non-local civilian identified as Virender Paswan was killed by the terrorists. Paswan was a resident of Bihar’s Bhagalpur area and resided at Alamgari Bazar Zadibal. While in the third attack, a civilian identified as Mohd Shafi Lone, a resident of Naidkhai, was shot dead. He was rushed to a hospital but was declared dead.

The statement from Deo comes at a time when reports of a possible rejig in the state leadership were already surfacing. It is also pertinent to note here that back-to-back developments are being witnessed amid a tussle between Bhupesh Baghel and TS Singh Deo for the Chief Minister's post.  T S Singh Deo cited examples of Punjab, Uttarakhand, and Tripura giving a clear indication of possible leadership change. Last month, state health minister T S Singh Deo had reached Delhi to meet the Congress high command when Bhupesh Baghel's resignation rumours were surfacing. The leader was seen leaving for the national capital from the Raipur Airport. The political crisis has erupted in the aftermath of a collision between the two camps led by Baghel and Deo over the party's promise to divide the Chief Ministership for 2.5-years. Reacting to the chaos in yet another Congress-ruled state, former Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh had claimed that governance in the state had been severely impacted owing to the rift in the Congress party. The infighting has been attributed to the Chhattisgarh Health Minister's insistence that he should be made the CM as per the rotational formula. In fact, more than 30 Congress MLAs had been camping in Delhi, to mount 'pressure' on the high command. The move was seen as a significant development since MLAs holed up in the national capital belonged to Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel's camp. Their departure from Delhi suggested that the apparent show of strength has fallen through, paving the way for TS Singh Deo to assume the post of the CM."

Ressa and Muratov have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 2021 for their brave fight for freedom of expression. At the same time, they are ambassadors for all journalists who fight for this ideal in a world where democracy and press freedom are increasingly threatened.  Maria Angelita Ressa became this year's first female Nobel laureate and the Philippines' first independent Nobel laureate. Maria A Ressa is the CEO and executive editor of Rappler, a social news network based in the Philippines. Ressa has worked as a journalist in Asia for nearly three decades, the majority of which she spent as the bureau chief of CNN in Manila (1987-1995) and subsequently Jakarta (1995-2005). She was CNN's main investigative correspondent covering terrorism in Southeast Asia and the author of Seeds of Terror: An Eyewitness Account of al-Newest Qaeda's Operations Center in Southeast Asia (Free Press, 2003). She became the president of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs in 2005, where she spent six years defining strategic direction and overseeing more than 1,000 journalists for the Philippines' largest multi-platform news operation. Ressa was named one of Time's Person of the Year 2018 as one of a group of journalists fighting fake news worldwide. Ressa is one of the 25 leading figures on Reporters Without Borders' Information and Democracy Commission. Ressa was awarded the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize in April 2021. She has taught courses throughout Southeast Asia on Politics and the Press for her alma mater, Princeton University, as well as broadcast journalism for the University of the Philippines. As author-in-residence and Senior Fellow at the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in Singapore, she worked on her second book, From Bin Laden to Facebook. She is also a Visiting Scholar from South-East Asia at the Naval Postgraduate School's CORE Lab in Monterey, California. Maria Ressa uses her right to free speech to expose abuses of power, the use of violence, and the rise of authoritarianism in her native Philippines. Ressa has demonstrated herself to be a brave supporter of freedom of expression as a journalist and CEO of Rappler. Rappler has criticised the Duterte administration's controversial and fatal anti-drug campaign. The campaign resembles a battle waged against the country's own people due to many deaths.  Ressa and Rappler have also exposed how social media is being used to propagate false information, harass dissenters, and sway public opinion. Dmitry Andreyevich Muratov is a Russian journalist and the editor-in-chief of the Russian daily Novaya Gazeta, which the Committee to Protect Journalists has described as ""the only authentically critical publication with national significance in Russia today."" The publication is noted for its in-depth coverage of delicate issues like government corruption and human rights violations. He was the editor of the newspaper from 1995 until 2017. The Committee to Protect Journalists awarded him the International Press Freedom Award in 2007. The prize honours journalists who have demonstrated courage in protecting journalistic freedom in the face of threats, incarceration, or violence. He was awarded the Legion of Honor, France's highest honour, in the degree of Chevalier on January 18, 2010. (Knight). In Middelburg, the Netherlands, on May 29, 2010, he received the Four Freedoms Award for Freedom of Speech for the Novaya Gazeta. He spent five years at Lomonosov Moscow State University's Faculty of Philology when he discovered his passion for journalism. He networked with local publications and worked part-time in journalism while in college. Muratov started working as a correspondent for the Volzhsky Komsomolets newspaper in 1987. At this publication, Muratov was given a chance to express himself and prove himself truly. His superiors were so impressed that he was promoted to Head of the Komsomolskaya Pravda Youth Department by the end of his first year and then to the editor of news pieces.

The municipal committee has lifted the previously imposed four-feet limit on idol size, as well as allowing batches of 50 individuals to pray at the same time. The number of batches, however, is unlimited. The organisers would have to request permission from the BBMP's Joint Commissioner and the police to install more than one idol in a ward, according to the updated guidelines. During the idol immersion (Visarjan) procession, the BBMP has imposed a total ban on DJs, Dhaks, and drums. Visarjan is only permitted at public tanks/immersion ponds that have been identified and approved by the Zonal Joint Commissioner and Police.  Unlike the earlier BBMP rule prohibiting the use of DJs, Dhaks, or drums during the Visarjan procession, the updated order allows musical instruments to be used during prayer ceremonies. The adjustments were made after the BBMP's earlier rules drew criticism. BJP MP Tejasvi Surya had written to the municipal authority, requesting a revision in the criteria. They were ""discriminatory"" and ""unconstitutional,"" he said. Surya's letter to BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta read, Apart from the aforementioned amendments, the BBMP's prior orders recommending other guidelines remain unchanged. COVID-appropriate behaviour must be closely monitored and adhered to by Puja associations. All visitors to the entry gate must also undergo thermal screening and sanitization, according to the BBMP. Additional sanitiser bottles should be placed throughout the site by the Puja associations. Sanitizing of chairs, tables, and floors at least four times a day is also required, said BBMP. The COVID safety standards must be posted inside the premises, and the BBMP has made it essential to provide portable drinking water to all visitors. Debi Boron is limited to no more than 10 people at a time by the Puja organisations. Sindur Khela is also limited to no more than 10 people at a time. The distribution of sweets, fruits, and flowers was prohibited by the municipality. The organisation will send out invitation cards with defined time slots for guests so that the total attendance does not exceed 100 at any given time. (with inputs from ANI) Image: PTI"

Even as she was incarcerated, the Customs department had slapped the stringent COFESOSA on her in October 2020. This law allows a person to be kept in preventive custody for up to one year without trial. The order of the division bench of the HC comprising Justices AK Jayasankaran Nambiar and Mohammed Nias CP came on a plea by Swapna Suresh's mother seeking the quashing of this detention order. The petition mentioned that the accused is the only woman who is in preventive detention under COFEPOSA in Kerala at present. In its order, the bench held that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant her detention under this stringent law. In custody since July 12, 2020, Suresh is currently lodged at the Women's Prison and Correctional Home, Attakulangara. Meanwhile, the Kerala High Court will hear her bail plea in the gold smuggling case registered by the NIA on October 22.  On July 5, 2020, Customs officials seized 30 kg of gold worth Rs.15 crore at the Thiruvananthapuram Airport from a diplomatic cargo addressed to a person in the UAE Consulate. Sarith PS, who worked at the UAE Consulate, was apprehended in this regard. Subsequently, Swapna Suresh, an ex-Consulate employee working as the manager of the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited and M Sivasankar, the ex-Principal Secretary to Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan were also arrested in this case. In January 2020, the NIA filed a charge sheet before the Special Court in connection with the Kerala gold smuggling case. Claiming that the conspiracy started in June 2019, the agency alleged that the aforesaid persons raised funds and smuggled 167 kg of gold between November 2019 and June 2020 through the import cargo addressed to diplomats at the Consulate General of UAE in Thiruvananthapuram. Furthermore, it added that the main accused had planned to smuggle more gold from countries such as Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. Holding them responsible for threatening the ""economic security of India"", the agency revealed that the probe against absconding persons and others who facilitated the crime is underway."

Meanwhile, as the 15-men Indian squad was announced, fans were elated to see veteran spinner Ravichandran Ashwin make his way into the T20I side, after last playing a T20 match for India in 2016. Another surprise addition to the squad was MS Dhoni’s inclusion as a mentor for Team India. With Dhoni set to make a return to the Indian dressing room, he will join the core leadership group of India along with Rohit Sharma and Kohli, looking to earn the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup title after 14 years.

Those arrested include Right-wing outfit-  Sri Ram Sene Hindustan's Taluk President Pundaleeka alias Maharaj and have been booked under IPC sections 302 (murder), 201 (evidence disappearing), 34 (criminal act), 341 (wrongful restraint), 120b (conspiracy), 384 (extortion). Mullah's beheaded body was found on railway tracks on September 28. Revealing details of the case, Belgavi District Superintendent of Police, Laxman Nimbargi found out that Mullah had been allegedly beheaded over his relationship with a Hindu girl named Shwetha. Mullah's mother Nazeema Mohammed Sheikh had lodged a complaint a day after his death saying that Shwetha's family did not approve of the relationship and hence had threatened Arbaz. She claimed that this had forced them to shift from Khanapur to Belgavi. Later on September 28, police found out that Pundaleeka had again summoned Arbaz to Khanapur while his mother was in Goa. He allegedly extorted money from him and later killed the 24-year-old. In a bid to destroy evidence, the Hindu outfit leader threw his body on rail tracks, stated the police. Moreover, during the probe, police found out that Shwetha's parents - Eerappa Kumar and Sushila Kumar - had paid Pundaleeka to murder Arbaz as they did not approve of the relation. Police have arrested - Pundaleeka, Qutubdin Alabhaksh, Sushila Eerappa, Maruthi, Manjunath, Ganpati, Eerappa Kumar, Prashant 
Praveen and Sridhar - in connection to the case. Arbaz Mullah was a car dealer based in Belgavi city, as per reports. He added, ""On September 28, Arbaz continued to receive calls. He called up his mother, who had gone to Goa, to ask if she received calls. Then he asked to remain safe and that he would broker a truce with them. At 5 PM he left from Belagavi and around 9 PM we got a call saying he was beheaded and was found on railway track"". AIMIM had threatened to protest if no arrests were made by Friday."

On October 8, 1932, the Indian Air Force was founded and since then, it has contributed majorly to several crucial wars and landmark missions. Initially, it was established as an auxiliary air force of the British Empire, that honoured India's aviation service with the prefix Royal during World War II. Following India's independence from the British in 1947, the name Royal Indian Air Force was retained and served in the name of the Dominion of India. However, three years later, in 1950, with the government's transition to a Republic, the prefix Royal was omitted. The IAF takes part in United Nations peacekeeping missions and not just engagement with hostile forces. This year, the celebratory parade commenced at the Hindon Air Force Station in Ghaziabad. This year, the IAF Day parade paid tribute to the heroes of the 1971 war, when India defeated Pakistan to help Bangladesh attain independence."

Back in 2012, she has even co-founded ‘Rappler,’ which is a digital media company for investigative journalism that she is still leading. The academy said in the official announcement, that “as a journalist and the Rappler’s CEO, Ressa has shown herself to be a fearless defender of freedom of expression.” Meanwhile, the other recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize 2021, Dmitry Andreyevich Muratov, for several decades has defended the freedom of speech in Russia under challenging circumstances. The Nobel Prize academy has considered how Muratov in 1993, was one of the founders of the independent newspaper Novaja Gazeta. Since 1995, he has been the editor-in-chief of the newspaper for a total of 24 years. As per the official announcement, “Novaja Gazeta is the most independent newspaper in Russia today, with a fundamentally critical attitude towards power.”"

In India, the pool of fast bowlers has always been thin, with only a few of them making it to the international stage and demonstrating their worth in the past century. However, since the inception of the Indian Premier League and the rise of Indian cricket as a whole, this has altered. India has evolved into a centre for batsmen and spinners, and fast bowlers who can crush any batting line-up on any surface, as the Jasprit Bumrah-led pace attack in England and Australia recently showed. Let's take a look at some of the quickest bowlers that India has produced so far in its rich cricketing history. Also, note that the list caters to cricketers who played at the international level after the introduction of the speed tracking device by the ICC. Former Indian cricketer Javagal Srinath holds the record for bowling the fastest delivery ever by an Indian speedster. During India's 1996/97 tour of South Africa, Srinath made it to the history books by registering the fastest delivery bowled by an Indian bowler. The Karnataka paceman clocked one of the deliveries at 157 kmph. The record still stands tall as no other Indian bowler has been able to breach the 157 kmph-mark.  Gujarat pacer Jasprit Bumrah holds the record for bowling the second fastest delivery by an Indian bowler. Bumrah clocked 153.26 kmph on the speedometer during the first Test match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2018. Bumrah also finished the series as the joint highest wicket-taker with 21 wickets.  In 2014, Mohammed Shami bowled the then second fastest delivery by an Indian pacer as he recorded 153.2 kmph during the third Test match against Australia in Melbourne. Shami immediately rose to fame with his amazing performance as he also finished the series as the highest wicket-taker. Navdeep Saini and Ishant Sharma have their names etched in the record books after bowling the fourth and the fifth-fastest deliveries respectively by Indian pacers. While Saini had clocked his fastest delivery at 152.85 kmph in the 2019 edition of the Indian Premier League, Sharma bowled at 152.6 kmph while playing against Australia in the Commonwealth Bank series in 2008.

A division bench of CJI NV Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli was hearing a plea based on the letter written by advocates Shiv Kumar Tripathi and CS Panda. Appearing for the UP government, Queen's Counsel Harish Salve stressed that the rigours of law will be applied against Mishra if he doesn't turn up before the police at 11 am on October 9 as per the notice.  Observing that Mishra has been charged under IPC Section 302, the CJI said that he should be treated like any other person accused in a murder case. When the senior advocate highlighted that the post-mortem of the deceased farmers did not show any gunshot injury, CJI Ramana maintained that this was not a ground for not taking the Union MoS Home Ajay Mishra's son into custody. Justice Kohli noted that ""the proof of the pudding is in the eating"". Commenting that the SIT formed to solve this case consists only of local officers, he reckoned that a proper probe may not be conducted. While Queen's Counsel Harish Salve made it clear that the bench can hand over the case to the CBI if it is not content with the progress of the investigation, the CJI responded, ""We have respect for you. We hope the state will take necessary steps due to the sensitivity of the issue. we are not making comments. CBI is not a solution for reasons known to you"". While acknowledging that the Yogi Adityanath-led government filed a status report of the probe, the bench asserted that it was not satisfied by the steps taken by the former. It added, ""Counsel assures he will satisfy the court and also apprise the court of an alternative agency which can conduct the probe"". The matter will now come up for hearing after the Dussehra vacation on October 20.  Violence broke out in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 3 leading to the death of 8 persons including 4 farmers.  Immediately after the horrific incident, UP CM Yogi Adityanath promised that the state government will expose the elements involved in the incident and take strict action against them. As per the FIR lodged by the UP police on Monday, Union MoS Home Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra and 15-20 unknown accused persons have been booked under IPC Sections 120B, 147, 148, 149, 279, 302, 304A and 338.  Apart from an SIT, the state government constituted a single-member Commission of Inquiry of Justice (retd.) Pradeep Kumar Srivastava to probe the Lakhimpur violence. As per a notification issued on October 6, the commission has to complete its probe within a period of two months. Moreover, the UP police formed a 9-member monitoring committee led by DIG (Headquarters) Upendra Agrawal in connection with this case. So far, the police have arrested two suspects- Luvkush and Ashish Pandey. "

Bumrah will look to use all his experience as well as the variations to outfox the batsmen and pick up wickets. Kane Williamson: The SRH skipper is a cool-headed customer and holds the key to SRH batting in David Warner's absence. His stay at the crease will decide if SRH will end up losing or will spoil the Mumbai Indians party  Jason Holder: The West Indies all-rounder is quite handy with both bat and ball and with the kind of bounce he generates from the pitch due to his height can cause trouble for MI batting lineup in terms of scoring big runs. Coming to Head to head record between these two teams, Mumbai Indians hold the slight edge. In the 17 matches played between both the teams, Mumbai Indians have won 9 matches while Hyderabad have managed to win 8 games. In their last match played between both the teams during the India-leg of IPL 2021 Mumbai Indians overcame Sunrisers Hyderabad challenge by 13 runs in Chennai."

According to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Petrol, diesel, cooking gas, and kerosene were sold at subsidised rates during the Congress-led UPA government. The then government had issued bonds to state-owned oil firms to make up for the difference in the artificially suppressed retail selling price of fuel and the cost, totalling Rs 1.34 lakh crore to the state-fule companies due to soaring international rates. In another update, oil marketing companies have increased the price of domestic LPG cylinders by Rs 15 per cylinder. In Delhi, the price of a non-subsidised 14.2 kg cylinder costs Rs 899.50. While 5Kg cylinder price stands at Rs 502. The exchange rate of the rupee against the dollar and the global benchmark rate are the two main factors that influence the LPG cylinders price in India. "

According to reports, the matches will be played concurrently to avoid giving an unfair advantage to any side in the competition. With the doubleheader on the last day of the league stage when the fourth spot for qualification is still open, the chances of a team gaining an unfair advantage over others would have been highly likely if the last fixture had a side with a mathematical chance of qualification. This is the first time in IPL history when the final two games of the league stage are being played concurrently.  As per the official release, the last two league matches before the IPL 2021 Playoffs will be played concurrently. On the last day of the league stage (08.10.2021) of the ongoing season, instead of having one afternoon match and one evening match, two matches (SRH v MI and RCB v DC) will be played simultaneously at 7.30 PM IST (6.00 PM GST). Phase 2 of the IPL 2021 resumed in the UAE on September 19. So far, three sides have made it to the knockout stage, while Mumbai Indians and Kolkata Knight Riders are still in the race for the fourth spot.

Speaking to the media in Lucknow, Yadav alleged that Union MoS Home has a close connection with Nepal. Calling upon the Centre to intervene, he expressed hope that it will ensure Mishra's repatriation so that he faces the law of the land.  Earlier, Ashish Mishra's relative Abhijaat Mishra maintained that the former is in Lakhimpur and would cooperate with the investigation. While the UP police has formed teams to find him, he is reportedly changing his location constantly. Sources told Republic TV that his legal team is contemplating all possible options including seeking anticipatory bail. Violence broke out in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 3 leading to the death of 8 persons including 4 farmers.  Immediately after the horrific incident, UP CM Yogi Adityanath promised that the state government will expose the elements involved in the incident and take strict action against them. While the Samyukta Kisan Morcha have blamed Ashish Mishra for killing the farmers, he and his father have denied the charges.  The Uttar Pradesh Police has formed a 9-member monitoring committee led by DIG (Headquarters) Upendra Agrawal in connection with the Lakhimpur violence case. The committee will comprise 10th Battalion PAC Barabanki commandant Sunil Kumar Singh, ASP Kheri Arun Kumar Singh, Mitaul Kheri CO Sandeep Singh, Gola CO Sanjay Nath Tiwari, Kheri Crime Branch Inspector Vidya Ram Diwakar, Kheri Police Station SHO Siya Ram Verma and Kheri Public Grievances Cell in-charge Dharm Prakash Shukla. Sub-Inspector Shiv Kumar who is the SWAT in-charge of Kheri will act as the technical assistant to the committee. So far, the police have arrested two suspects- Luvkush and Ashish Pandey. "

Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) national President Jagat Prakash Nadda, Union Ministers and other top leaders paid tribute to the legendary politician on his death anniversary.  Top leaders paid tribute to Jayaprakash Narayan on Koo:   Jayaprakash Narayan is popularly referred to as JP or Lok Nayak (people's hero).  JP is most known for leading the opposition to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the mid-1970s. On June 25, 1975, he spearheaded the campaign against the Emergency declared by then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Jayaprakash Narayan was born in the Saran district's Sitab Diara on October 11, 1902. He was the fourth child of Harsu Dayal Srivastava and Phul Rani Devi, and he came from a Kayastha community. Jayaprakash Narayan left his village at the age of nine to enrol in class seven of a college institution in Patna. He took the 'State Public Matriculation Examination' in 1918 and was awarded a District merit scholarship to Patna College. Narayan once travelled to Patna to hear Maulana Abul Kalam Azad speak against Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement.  Maulana's plea to abandon English education impacted Jayaprakash Narayan. He heeded the Maulana's advice and left Patna College early for his exams. He enrolled in the Bihar Vidyapeeth, a Congress-run college. Jayaprakash Narayan, at 20 years old, travelled on the cargo ship Janus, while Prabhavati (his wife and Indian independence activist) remained in Sabarmati. On October 8, 1922, he arrived in California and was admitted to Berkeley in January 1923. In the 1960s, Jayaprakash Narayan returned to state politics. Jayaprakash, 72, led a silent walkthrough of Patna on April 8, 1974, protesting excessive inflation, unemployment, and a lack of supplies and necessary commodities. The march was accompanied by a lathi charge. He spoke to a large gathering at Gandhi Maidan in the state capital on June 5, 1974. In 1974, he led a student movement in the state that grew into the 'Bihar Movement' or 'JP Movement,' which eventually became a popular people's movement. Image: PTI/@JPNadda/Twitter"

Gambhir believes that Rahul has got more cricketing shots in his armoury than any other batter in India at the moment. Gambhir's comment came after the 53rd match of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL 2021) in the United Arab Emirates, where Rahul played a spectacular inning to help his side win.  Rahul scored an unbeaten 98 runs off 42 balls, including eight sixes and seven boundaries, to help Punjab Kings (PBKS) beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by six wickets and 42 balls to spare. As far as IPL 2021 is concerned, Rahul is currently on top of the leaderboard in terms of the total runs scored as he has hit 626 runs in 13 matches at an impressive average of 62.60. Rahul has been scoring at an average of more than 50 for the past four seasons in the IPL. The 29-year-old had finished as the highest run-scorer in IPL 2020 as well.  Gambhir further said that Punjab Kings would have been in the top four of the points table had Rahul batted with similar freedom from the start of the tournament.  Batting first, CSK were restricted by Punjab bowlers for 134/6 in 20 overs. Faf du Plessis remained the lone warrior for the MS Dhoni-led side as he scored 76 off 55 runs before being dismissed by Mohammed Shami. MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja scored some runs towards the backend of the first innings, but their slow effort could not help CSK breach even the 140-run mark. Arshdeep Singh and Chris Jordan picked two wickets each for PBKS, while Shami and Ravi Bishnoi picked one each. Meanwhile, Punjab Kings lost Mayank Agarwal early for 12 runs, courtesy of Shardul Thakur. However, KL Rahul, along with some brief partnerships with Aiden Markram and Shahrukh Khan, single-handedly chased down the target. Rahul's amazing 98 runs came at a time when Punjab was losing wickets at regular intervals. Rahul was adjudged the player of the match for his superb performance with the bat.  "

As per France24, the militant organisation in the war-torn country is seeking global recognition as the Central Asian nation continues to grapple with drought, growing security threat and the daunting challenges of an economy,which is on the brink of collapse. The United Nations humanitarian agencies and their partners have requested the world leaders to keep their promises to Afghanistan as they struggle to scale up delivery of vital aid ahead of the upcoming winter season.  It is to mention that even before the Taliban's takeover in August, Afghanistan was already facing one of the world's worst humanitarian situations, which has now further escalated. As of 6 October, the outfit-led government doubled on their hard-line trajectory while making deputy position appointments. Owing to the Taliban's approach to women's rights, the UN last month turned down their request to allow a chosen envoy to speak at the General Assembly. On 17 September, several Republican members wrote a letter to State Secretary Antony Blinken stating that ""the current version of the Taliban government presents a significant threat to the United States."" Following the reports of manifold violence observed by the UNHRC Chief Ursula Von der Leyen last month, several countries, including those of the EU called on the leaders to not recognise the Taliban. Meanwhile, its political, educational and cultural reforms have also been condemned worldwide pushing back the slimmest chances of presenting a motto on the global platform. The Taliban imposed unexplained bans on women and children's education and employment since its rise to power. They imposed a ban on women working with men in the same room. On 5 October, the acting minister of the higher education of the Taliban, Abdul Baqi Haqqani said that the outfit-led government will not recognise those who have graduated from high school between 2000-2020. The outfit has also issued a ban on co-education as well prohibited men from teaching girl students.  Similar flawed judgements were observed in terms of citizens who wished to pursue a career in modern studies arts. Protests that flooded against the draconian implication of Islamic Laws were countered with violence and violations of human rights. The harrowing humanitarian situation has also been aggravated by droughts, the COVID-19 pandemic, and significant shortfalls in other major sectors as well as doubled casualties."

In a release, the White House said that the emergency announced as a part of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, will go beyond its deadline, which is October 14 2021. The extension, as per the presidential office, was made to tackle the “unusual and extraordinary” threat to national security in Syria and in accordance with the country’s national foreign policy.  The national emergency with respect to the Syrian crisis was first declared under former president Donald Trump’s administration in October 2019. On Thursday, Biden said that recent actions by Bashar al-Assad’s administration and Turkish troops have undermined the Pentagon's campaign to defeat ISIS and have also jeopardised ‘peace, security and stability’ in the region. Notably, Turkish troops and the Syrian National Army (SNA), which critics say is an auxiliary army of the Turkish government, have jointly conducted multiple operations in Northeastern Syria including the 2019 offensives which lead to the establishment of the Idlib governorate.  Notably, the Governorate of Idlib and parts of Aleppo, Hama and Latakia are among the last rebel-held areas. The Syrian civil war commenced in 2011 after the country's president Bashar Hafez Al-Assad tried to suppress opposition to his authoritarian rule, which now extends to 21 years. While armed fighting has now ended, the government and militias continue to engage in a war of nerves and occasional assaults. With the coronavirus contagion wreaking havoc, the Syrian economy has plunged manifold, with roughly 80 per cent of the population living under the poverty line. The pandemic has posed a challenging situation for countries all across the globe; however, for Syria, it has been a significant challenge with its economy and health care sector crippling due to the decade-long war-like situation.

He has scored nine goals for Real Madrid along with seven assists in eight matches in the LaLiga 2021-22 and one goal while appearing in two UEFA Champions League matches. Benzema’s brilliant goal in the 62nd minute for France, at a time when they were falling behind Belgium by 0-2, gave the team a much-needed revival, as they now head to the finals after winning the match 2-3. Meanwhile, Benzema also became the sixth-highest goal scorer for France’s all-time list by surpassing Zinedine Zidane with a total of 32 goals. He has scored these goals in a total of 91 matches he has played for the club. The fact that he was away from the national team, proves his stature in the game. He scored a total of 30 goals for Real Madrid in the LaLiga 2020-21 season and has been the key factor for the team for their brilliant start of the current season. The semi-final clash against Belgium was Benzema’s third game for France in the 2021 season, after previously making a return during the UEFA Euro 2020. Following the goal, Kylian Mbappe scored the equalizer at the 69th minute through a penalty and Theo Hernandez handed France the lead by scoring a final minute goal.

A Twitter user mentioned in his tweet that Karim Benzema is currently the best player of Real Madrid, LaLiga, the France National Team. He praised the footballer and ended the tweet by asking if Benzema is currently the best player in the world.

PDP Suhail Bukhari claimed that the LG had 'lost his moral authority' to continue his job following the increased number of targeted killings that were taking place in the valley over the last few weeks. Calling out the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Mehbooba Mufti-led party blamed the Centre for the security situation in the valley.  PDP leader Suhail Bukhari said, ""LG has lost his moral authority to continue his job in the erstwhile state following the recent killing of the civilians in the valley. For the past two years, MHA is directly controlling the security situation in the valley. And look what it has led to us today.""  Earlier in the day, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi had hit out at the Centre over the killings, claiming that the Centre's revocation of Article 370 had failed to check terror in the valley. ""Incidents of violence are increasing in Kashmir. Terrorism was neither stopped by demonetisation nor by abrogation of Article 370 – the central government has completely failed to provide security,"" said the Gandhi scion.  Over the last few weeks, civilians including religious minorities are being targeted by the terrorists in the UT. On Tuesday, a prominent Kashmiri Pandit businessman and a non-Kashmiri local vendor were shot dead by terrorists. Following this, two teachers-- a Sikh principal and a Pandit teacher were killed by terrorists inside a Srinagar school on Thursday. In less than a week, a total of 7 people have lost their lives in the rising terror incidents.

In the past, he was responsible for engineering the Mahagathbandhan, working with Nitish Kumar for his election campaign in 2015. Following that, in September 2018, on the advice of then BJP chief Amit Shah, Kishor was inducted as the vice president of Nitish Kumar's JDU. Following his induction in 2019, the JDU fared extremely well in the Lok Sabha polls along with ally BJP, completely decimating Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD. He was later kicked out for publicly condemning Nitish for voting for CAA. Moreover, he is also known for his successful poll campaigns, mainly Narendra Modi's 2012 campaign who back then was the Gujarat CM Modi's. Additionally, he was also a part of Modi's debut PM bid in 2014. Kishor helped Congress' Capt Amarinder Singh win Punjab Assembly polls in 2017 and Jagan Mohan Reddy win his maiden CM term in 2019.

Addressing the employees at his company’s annual meeting, the 50-year-old billionaire said that Tesla was aiming to bolster its output by 50 per cent with the relocation. Musk, who shifted to Texas in December, is building a massive car and battery manufacturing complex there.  Notably, Tesla is not the only company to quit Silicon Valley. Previously multi nations like Oracle, HP and Toyota Motor shifted their bases from the San Francisco Bay area. While Texas is known to have lower taxes, extensive labour and less stringent regulations as compared to California,  Musk said that the reason behind the move to the California factory in Fremont was becoming “jammed.” In addendum, he also touted that the coastal state was also posing problems to his employees in finding affordable housing.  Meanwhile, Tesla recently said that it has delivered around 241,300 electric vehicles in the third quarter even though it struggled with a global shortage of computer chips that have hit the entire auto industry. According to AP, Tesla, which is based in Palo Alto, California, saw sales from July through September beat Wall Street estimates of 227,000 sales worldwide. Tesla’s third-quarter sales rose 72 per cent over the 140,000 deliveries that the firm made for the same period a year ago.  Associated Press revealed that so far this year, Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company has sold around 627,300 vehicles. This puts Tesla on pace to soundly beat last year’s total of 499,550. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives reportedly told the investors that the pace of Tesla deliveries in the US and China has been strong for the past month or so. "

While a special CBI court rejected their bail pleas in a quid-pro-quo case pertaining to Dewan Housing Financial Limited on September 18, the Bombay High Court too refused to grant them any relief. As per the CBI, Rana Kapoor had entered into a criminal conspiracy with DHFL's Kapil Wadhawan whereby Yes Bank invested Rs.3700 crore in short-term debentures of DHFL from April-June 2018. The central agency alleged that DHFL paid a kickback of Rs.900 crore to Kapoor in the form of loans to DoIT Urban Ventures, a firm controlled by the Yes Bank co-founder's wife and daughters. In its verdict on October 7, the SC bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh highlighted that the Magistrate had granted bail to the petitioners despite being charged under stringent IPC sections whereas they were denied bail after facing lesser offences in the supplementary charge sheet. It directed the Additional Solicitor General to file a counter-affidavit within 4 weeks.  Rana Kapoor was arrested by the ED on March 8, 2020, after 30 hours of questioning. The ED has alleged that Kapoor misused his position as the Chief Executive Officer of Yes Bank to benefit his daughters' companies. According to the agency, loans worth Rs.30,000 crore were given by Yes Bank when he was at the helm of affairs. Out of these, advances of Rs. 20,000 crore became NPAs (non-performing assets). After the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Yes Bank co-founder moved a bail application citing a threat to his life. The plea mentioned that the Yes Bank founder's existing medical conditions such as bronchial asthma, chronic immunodeficiency syndrome, severe hypertension, depression put him at a high risk of a lung infection if he contracted COVID-19 in jail. Additionally, it was argued that Kapoor needed to stay at home and get home-cooked food. But, he continues to languish in jail as this plea and subsequent applications were rejected. "

As per that, the daily limit of the IMPS fund transfer mechanism has been enhanced for the bank customers and will further aid in a seamless money transfer.  As informed by  RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, the Immediate Payment Service or IMPS transfer limit will be now increased considering the importance of IMPS in the COVID-19 pandemic. It will further enable instant domestic fund transfer and enhance consumer convenience, he added.  Das while addressing the Monetary Policy Committee on Friday further announced that a framework will be also introduced for offline retail digital payment solutions. The introduction will help to reach the remote areas of the country which has very little internet connectivity and thus will expand the digital payments.  Immediate Payment Service or IMPS is a 24/7 service for transferring real-time money. It was introduced in 2010 and allows the transfer of funds instantly across India from one bank to another. Not just it is a safe medium of transfer but is also very economical.  As stated by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), IMPS is a big step towards building a seamless mobile banking service in India. It is also one of the earliest initiatives taken by the Central government enabling bank customers to use their mobile phones as a channel for accessing bank accounts and transactions. Meanwhile, anyone who needs to use the IMPS service needs to register with the mobile banking service of their respective bank.

The development comes amid fresh demand from the party's Group of 23 (G-23) dissident leaders for holding a Congress Working Committee meeting. The Congress party leader has said that the CWC meeting will be called next week, though there is no clarity on the agenda. Among other things likely to be discussed in the CWC meeting, include the roadmap for the upcoming assembly polls in five states which are due early next year. Even so, the key agenda is the decision on organisational polls for the post of the Congress party president. The G23 leaders have demanded elections for CWC members, Central Election Committee (CEC) members, and Parliamentary Board Elections. Recently, senior Congress leader and former MP Ghulam Nabi Azad penned a letter to Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi for holding an urgent meeting of the CWC. In addition, Congress leader Kapil Sibal also informed that the leaders are not aware of who is taking the decision in the party.  Sibal's remarks irked party cadres who protested outside his residence. Moreover, All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary Ajay Maken too hit out at Sibal and said that he should not be degrading the organisation that gave him an identity. The party's internal polls were postponed in wake of the second wave of COVID-19 and no timeline was given. However, a party member informed that the polls will likely take place after the assembly polls in five important states. In addition, there is no clarity on whether Rahul Gandhi will take over the post of party president and will contest for Party president post. Even so, the Youth Congress, National Students' Union of India  (NSUI), Mahila Congress and Social Media's National Executives have passed a resolution and thrown their weight behind Gandhi to make him the party President. But the G23 leader have maintained that the party should have a full-time president. "

Although there is no information about when the cable will be functional, Facebook has also announced the Terragraph technology, which will create a mmWave mesh and provide a solution to last-mile connectivity. In addition to the subsea cable connecting the United States with Europe, Facebook is also working on another undersea cable that will connect Africa with Asia and Europe. The African project cable will be docked in 46 cities which would be in 33 countries. During a press briefing, Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer said that ""We have designed floating power stations that sit in the middle of the ocean, harnessing the power of the sun and the waves, delivering it to the cables in the ocean floor, allowing us to boost their capacity.""  In a public statement, Vice President of Facebook Connectivity Dan Rabinovitsj says that the company is building the 2Africa Pearls subsea cable, over 150,000 km. Alongside, the company is also working on new technologies that will improve the performance of these cables. The massive data cable line on the outskirts of the African continent will help increase the bandwidth that reaches there. Facebook has also released a predictive route of where the subsea data cables will be placed to avoid the dangers of fishing and undersea volcanoes.  The undersea cables require a constant supply of electricity to boost the data speeds. However, since the primary electricity supplies of these offshore stations are provided from the land, there is a limit to it. Program Manager, Submarine Cables at Facebook, Cynthia Perret, explained in a public statement that Facebook is also exploring an opportunity to generate power by using a combination of solar panels and wave energy converters. Facebook is also trying to solve the last-mile connectivity issue with its Terragraph technology, which is already in use in Alaska and Perth. The technology works by installing a transmitter box mounted onto the poles that carry a street sign and delivers decent performance wirelessly. "

The bypoll is scheduled on October 30, and the last date of filing nomination papers is October 8. On the other hand, BJP has fielded Mahesh Gavit as its candidate for the bypolls. Gavit (44) is a tribal leader who was elected to the Dadra and Nagar Haveli district panchayat as a councillor on BJP's ticket, as per reports. Congress is yet to field a candidate.

Speaking at a press briefing on Thursday, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that as a part of the Global COVID Vaccination Strategy, by the end of 2021 WHO has planned to inoculate at least 40% of the population in every country with most importance to lower-income countries, particularly those in Africa. The decision comes after at least 56 middle East and African countries failed to meet the set target of 10% complete vaccination of their population by September this year. According to the WHO director, the Strategy ""will help to bring an end to what has become a two-track pandemic - people in poorer countries continue to be at risk while those in richer countries with high vaccination rates enjoy much greater protection."" To achieve the global targets, Tedros suggested a three-step approach: older adults, health workers, at-risk groups of all ages. This is to be followed by adult age groups in every country and lastly extended vaccination of adolescents, he said in a statement. As per WHO statistics, it will require at least 11 billion vaccines to meet the said target. The vaccine count stipulated by WHO is an allocation problem rather than a supply problem, Tedros said during the press briefing. ""With Global vaccine production now nearly at 1.5 billion doses per month, there is enough supply to achieve our target provided they are distributed equitably,"" he noted. ""Sciences played its part by delivering powerful, life-saving tools faster than for any outbreak in history,"" Tedros said adding, ""but the concentration of those tools in the hands of few countries and companies has led to global catastrophe, with the rich protected by the poor remain exposed to the deadly virus."" He called for a political commitment, action and cooperation to ensure a coordinated approach and break the ""two-track pandemic"" course. Tedros also outlined the priority actions for manufacturers, distributors, civil societies and investors deemed necessary under the Strategy. He added that substantial financing has been invested in procuring most of the required vaccine doses for low and middle-income countries. Lastly, he concluded by urging all UN organisations like UNICEF, CEPI, CDC and many more to monitor progress and identify necessary changes to resolve bottlenecks."

While politicians were prevented entry into Lakhimpur-Kheri until Wednesday afternoon, Tikait was allowed to enter the district on the night of October 3 itself. Though the kin of the deceased farmers had refused to allow their post-mortem unless Ashish Mishra is arrested and Ajay Mishra is ousted from the Union Council of Ministers, they relented after Tikait's intervention.  Rakesh Tikait said, ""We have to talk to the government. We take the agitation from the struggle to a solution. The government takes the agitation from a solution to the struggle. This is the difference between political parties and us"". ""The solution will come only through dialogue. 12 rounds of talks took place in Delhi. We repeatedly told the government to start a dialogue again,"" he added.  Addressing a press briefing alongside Tikait on Monday, DG (Law & Order) Prashant Kumar stated that an FIR will be registered on the complaint of farmers and a retired High Court judge will probe the violence. He also announced that the state government will provide a compensation of Rs.45 lakh and a government job to the families of the deceased farmers and Rs.10 lakh to the injured. However, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha has remained firm on seeking the arrest of Ashish Mishra.  As per the FIR lodged by the UP police on Monday, farmers and labourers were peacefully protesting against Ajay Misra and Uttar Pradesh Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya at the playground of the Maharaja Agrasen Inter College on October 3 by showing black flags. The complainant Jagjit Singh mentioned that three vehicles ferrying Ashish Misra and 15-20 unknown persons drove towards the event venue in Banbirpur village at high speed at around 3 pm. He also claimed that Misra was sitting on the left seat of his Mahindra Thar vehicle, fired at protesters and proceeded ahead by mowing down farmers. Alleging that two farmers succumbed to bullet injuries, the complainant added that Ashish Misra's three cars turned turtle due to high speed which left many passersby injured. After this, he reportedly opened fire again and fled the spot. Lamenting that no action was taken against the Union MoS Home for allegedly threatening farmers, the FIR claimed that this was a ""pre-planned conspiracy"" by Ajay Misra and his son. However, Ajay Misra and his son have flatly denied these charges claiming that they were not present at the site. "

However poor performance in the second leg has put the Mumbai Indians playoff chances in jeopardy.

Sushil Modi said that there wasn’t anyone in the RJD strong enough to oust Tej Pratap Yadav from the party. The former CM’s comments come after the names of Lalu Prasad's eldest daughter Misa Bharti, a Rajya Sabha MP, and elder son Tej Pratap Yadav were dropped from RJD's star campaigners' list for the upcoming by-elections to a couple of assembly seats in Bihar. The list, signed by the party's principal national secretary-general Abdul Bari Siddiqui, includes the names of Lalu Prasad Yadav and 19 others. The omission of Tej Yadav is being seen as a move supported by Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who wish to side-line his other siblings. Prasad's wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi, a demure housewife-turned-politician is another notable omission. Lately, she was found more content playing the role of the family matriarch that often betrays hints of being torn apart by competing ambitions of her children. Currently, BJP is the principal rival of RJD in the state who took on the opportunity to fish in troubled waters. State BJP spokesman and national general secretary of OBC morcha Nikhil Anand said in a statement RJD has finally signalled that both Tej Pratap Yadav and Misa Bharti are no longer desired by their own party and they must fend for themselves. Misa, a Rajya Sabha member, looks unlikely to be considered for another term while Tej Pratap has already floated his own organization.  The Congress too is hopeful of getting something out of the intra-family dynamics that control its bigger ally with RJD's unilateral announcement of candidates for Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan. While Ashok ram, who had earlier contested the reserved Kusheshwar Asthan seat in the assembly polls and whose son Atirek is the candidate for the upcoming by-poll, is expected to rope in Tej Pratap for the Congress campaign. On the other hand, the Left Front has announced its full support to the RJD in the upcoming Nihar by-polls as they are furious over former JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar switching over to the Congress. The five-party Grand Alliance helmed by the RJD comprises the CPI(ML) Liberation, the CPI and the CPI (M) who together have about 20 MLAs along with the Congress.  Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, whose JD(U) in the assembly polls had won both the seats, when asked about his response over infighting in the opposition camp, said, ""It is for you journalists to analyze"". The JD(U) has announced the candidate list for both the seats, which it seeks to retain with the backing of the BJP and smaller NDA partners like the Hindustani Awam Morcha and Vikassheel Insaan Party. On October 30, voting is scheduled to take place and results will be announced on November 2. "

Penning an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Friday, Executive Editor Sanjay Raut countered ex-Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis' argument that the support for BJP is increasing as compared to the Maha Vikas Aghadi as the former emerged as the single-largest party. Taking a dig at BJP, Raut highlighted that Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP had done well despite ""politically motivated"" action by the central investigative agencies. ""BJP could not gain despite MVA parties fighting separately in many places. This means that the people have kept BJP in check. BJP did not leave any opportunity in maligning the MVA government. They kept levelling several allegations including corruption. They put pressure on MVA Ministers and leaders by using ED, CBI and IT. Even then, BJP could not succeed,"" he added.  In its verdict dated March 4, the Supreme Court struck down 27 percent OBC reservation in Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis in Maharashtra. As a consequence, 85 seats in 6 Zilla Parishads-  Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim, Nagpur, Palghar and 144 Panchayat Samiti seats fell vacant. After a delay owing to the COVID-19 situation, the State Election Commission finally conducted the by-elections on October 5. While candidates in 1 ZP seat and 2 Panchayat Samiti seats won unopposed, the SEC announced the results for the other seats on October 6. BJP emerged as the single-largest party in the ZP bypolls with 22 seats followed by Congress (19), NCP (15) and Shiv Sena (12). Thus, the Maha Vikas Aghadi managed to win 46 out of 85 seats on offer. Most importantly, Congress retained the Nagpur ZP increasing its tally by two more seats. As far as the Panchayat Samitis are concerned, Congress bagged 36 seats as compared to BJP that could win 33 seats. As Shiv Sena and NCP secured a victory in 23 and 18 seats respectively, the MVA won a total of 73 of 144 seats. "

The deal, signed in 2015 between Iran and other major world powers, including the United States, France, Britain, China, Russia, and Germany (P5+1), saw Washington lifting economic sanctions against Tehran and in return, the Islamic Republic agreed to bring down its uranium enrichment programme. However, former US President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the pact in 2018, calling the structure of the deal ""rotten"". The Islamic Republic then retaliated by ending its compliance with the deal. As of now, six talks have been held in an attempt to revive the controversial nuclear pact, but despite US President Joe Biden vowing to resume the pact at the earliest, negotiations continue to be in limbo.

There are arrangements in place, but it will be controlled and they have to stay in a managed environment. But for example, it will be possible for them to play golf on a golf course, where we have set aside the area for them, and we can keep them separate from other people. So we maintain the managed environment, but we do allow people to do things other than sit in their hotel room,” he pointed.

It helps in getting the right navigations directions, controlling music, taking hands-free phone calls while driving and more. Apple iPhone users can even control the driver assistance system with their voice using Siri. While the features help millions of users around the world, Apple is planning to increase its functionality.  The Cupertino-based tech giant is looking forward to expanding Apple CarPlay's capabilities and integrate deeper into vehicles to enable new features and controls. By extending its features, Apple CarPlay will let users control more of their vehicle's systems.  Reports also suggest that the project has been named ""IronHeart"" and aims to compile multiple features into a single application like Apple Health and Apple Home.  According to a report by Bloomberg, Apple is working to extend the usability of Apple CarPlay over more systems in a car such as the air conditioner, climate control, audio output settings, seats and armrests, along with the speedometer. However, automakers might be uncomfortable sharing such vitals of a vehicle and its systems with Apple's driving assistant software. Additionally, there are several third-party applications that help users with additional features which are mentioned above and are made by the automotive manufactures themselves. For instance, Apple launched the Car Key feature with iOS 14 back in 2020 and it is only available in the latest BMW vehicles. If the expansion of CarPlay features has to take place, car manufacturers would have to work with Apple to integrate the application into their system. So far, manufacturers have been reluctant to do so. As of now, Apple CarPlay works by connecting an iPhone with a car's infotainment system.  In addition to other paid services that Apple provides to its users, the improved Apple CarPlay can prove to be a big moneymaker for the company. Further, the data Apple will access in due course of providing the feature can lead to the development of other comprehensive services. Previously, some Apple users have reported that they have to switch to the car's built-in infotainment system to manage some main controls of the vehicle. "

The Indian Premier League platform is an idle opportunity for youngsters to sharpen their cricketing skills while rubbing shoulders with the very best in the business. While Chennai Super Kings skipper MS Dhoni has been seen interacting with the youngsters, RCB skipper Virat Kohli too followed his former skipper's footstep and has been sharing advice with the youngsters during IPL 2021.  The advice given by one of the best cricketers in international cricket worked magic for some of the youngsters who went on to score a half-century the very next match. Here's a look at the three youngsters who benefitted from Virat Kohli's advice during the IPL 2021. The tall left-hander made his IPL debut against Royal Challengers Bangalore and from there, went on to cement his place in KKR Playing XI courtesy of some outstanding knock with the bat so far. The biggest moment in a youngsters life came when he got a chance to interact with RCB skipper Virat Kohli. After a smashing 41 run knock against RCB, Venkatesh Iyer was seen getting some advice from Virat Kohli.  The advice seemed to work for the youngster who scored half-century (53 runs) against Mumbai Indians in the next match. Yashasvi Jaiswal has had a good IPL 2021 tournament so far and is currently the third-highest run-getter Rajasthan Royals in the tournament. The youngster had a mixed start to the second leg and against RCB he had scored 31 runs from 27 balls. The Royals lost the match to RCB by 7 wickets but for the youngster, the loss turned out to be a blessing in disguise as he along with some other youngsters from the team got a chance to interact with Virat Kohli. Post the interaction, Yashasvi Jaiswal scored a half-century against CSK in the match which RR won by 7 wickets. The Mumbai Indians cricketer was recently selected for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup, however, the wicketkeeper-batsman had failed to hit the strides in the initial matches of the second leg. During Mumbai Indians match against RCB Ishan Kishan scored only 9 runs and was dismissed by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal. Post the RCB vs MI match, Virat Kohli was seen consoling Ishan Kishan who was looking emotional. The chat proved to be a motivating factor for the youngster who returned back to form with a half-century against Rajasthan Royals in the previous match.  "

As per a press release from Rashtrapati Bhavan, President Kovind further explained that without human resources, the infrastructure will be useless. He also said, “All technology would be useless if we don't have a robust delivery mechanism. We need to take our health services to the remotest corners of our country. We can hope to build an Atmanirbhar Bharat only when our technology, human resources and the access to both come together.""  He expressed his delight at the CIMS' third-place ranking in the Ayushman Bharat-Arogya Karnataka scheme's effective implementation in 2020-21. Commenting on the Centre's effort to combat COVID, he stated that the recurrence of COVID-19 has mostly subsided and that this would not have been achievable without the tremendous devotion of the medical community. He added that some people gave their lives in the line of duty while dealing with the disease.  The President also stated that the unwavering zeal of the corona warriors such as physicians, nurses, paramedics, as well as others, have made the country proud. The greatest immunisation campaign in history was made possible by the same devotion, he added.  President Kovind went on to say that India has not only manufactured coronavirus vaccines domestically, but it has also set new global records for vaccination administration. As per the press release, he further ssaid, “In a single day, we managed to vaccinate close to 25 million people, and our cumulative coverage will soon cross the one billion marks.”  The President emphasised that healthcare and education are the two professions that provide the twin pillars for a nation's growth.

Here is MEA's response amid request by Taliban https://t.co/V7uoN7bt5D,https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/india-afghanistan-flights-to-resume-here-is-meas-response-amid-request-by-taliban.html,5.0,29.0,India-Afghanistan Flights To Resume? Here Is MEA's Response Amid Request By Taliban,"A month after the Taliban government requested the Directorate General of Civil Aviation for resuming flights between India and Afghanistan, MEA weighed in on this possibility on Thursday. After the terrorist group seized control of Kabul on August 15, commercial flights between the two countries have been suspended. While mentioning that he did not have information about the immediate resumption of flights, MEA official spokesperson Arindam Bagchi termed it as a ""sensitive"" issue. In a letter dated September 7, Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority's Acting Minister Alhaj Hameedullah Akhunzada urged the DGCA to allow Ariana Afghan Airlines and Kam Air to operate their flights between the two nations. He added, ""As you are well informed that recently the Kabul airport was damaged and (left) dysfunctional by American troops before their withdrawal. By the technical assistance of our Qatar Brother, the Airport became operational once again and a NOTAM in this regard was issued on 6 September 2021"".  After the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, the Centre has been focused on ensuring security in the war-torn country. For instance, PM Modi chaired meetings of the Cabinet Committee on Security on August 17 and 18 to review the evacuation process of the Indians and the steps taken to ensure the safety of Sikhs and Hindus stranded in Afghanistan. So far, India has evacuated over 800 individuals from Afghanistan which includes the Indian Embassy staff, their families, and security personnel as a part of 'Operation Devi Shakti'. Moreover, the safety, security and early return of Indian nationals stranded in Afghanistan featured in the meeting between India's Ambassador to Qatar Deepak Mittal and the Taliban Political Office head Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai on August 31. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Home Affairs introduced a new category of electronic visa called “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” to fast-track visa applications of Afghans enabling them to enter India for 6 months. At the recently concluded SCO Summit, PM Modi asserted that the change in power in Afghanistan happened without negotiation and made it clear that the new Taliban government is not inclusive. "

According to a report by TechRepublic, privacy research firm 'Privacy Affairs' has revealed that the personal data of over 1.5 billion users which includes names, email addresses, locations, genders, phone numbers, and Facebook User ID information was found on a hacker forum recently. The data has been obtained by the company by 'scraping', as per Privacy Affairs. This means that the seller did not necessarily manage to gain access to Facebook’s internal systems, but obtained the information by 'scraping' publicly available data and organising it into databases and lists. However, the breach still comes as a concern for a Facebook user's security. It could provide hackers with clues to reset user passwords and gain access to even more personal data. After the matter came to light, Facebook sent a takedown request. As per the latest reports, the post has been taken down from the hacker forum. Privacy Affairs stated that the exposé came to the fore with the help of a four-year-old scraping business. The seller claimed that the group had been operating for the past four years serving more than 18,000 clients. If data exposed in the leak is authentic, then it could constitute one of the biggest and most significant Facebook data dumps to date, as per Privacy Affairs founder and CEO Miklos Zoltan. He also revealed that Facebook Quizzes are a common way for hackers to harvest data. Every time someone enters one of these surveys or quizzes, they permit the creators of these games to view their personal Facebook information such as full name, email, phone number, location, gender and more, he stated. On Monday, October 4, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg lost $7 billion after Facebook’s platforms-- Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp and Oculus VR services faced a worldwide outage. Users of the social networking platforms received error messages for the most part of the day which in turn, pulled down the stocks of the Silicon Valley firm by nearly 5%."

Google optimised traffic signals by using AI to time the traffic lights in a manner that they do not keep a lot of vehicles waiting and hence saves fuel. In addition to fuel, the stopping time at a traffic signal also inflates stress-level air pollution. Keep reading to know more about Google's plan to combat climate change and shift towards more sustainable and environment-friendly products.  Most recently, Google has been called out by its employees and external advocacy group to use its influence and help fight climate change. Prioritizing sustainable features and products, Google is developing a new AI-based technology that will help calculate the traffic conditions and timing at a four-way intersection and optimise it so that all the vehicles spend less time standing in a queue at the red signal, decreasing the use of fuels and environmental pollution in the process.  Google has run pilots of the AI-based traffic signal optimiser technology at four locations in Israel in collaboration with Haifa municipality, and Israel National Roads Company. The Alphabet-owned company has also stated that it has been able to reduce the fuel consumption and delay time experienced at the intersections by 10 to 20%. In a recent event, Google's Chief Sustainability officer Kate Brandt has said that ""on the back of promising results, we are now beginning new pilots in Rio De Janeiro and speaking with other cities around the globe."" The technology is still in its early phase and there is a lot of research and calculations left to be done. However, the idea and the results it was able to achieve look promising. The AI-based technology that has to be implemented at a busy city intersection has to be highly refined as it will be responsible for the safety of humans that are driving their vehicles through the intersections. In addition to the technology, Google search results now highlight sustainable travel and shopping, in pursuit of providing users with more information on sustainable shopping.   "

Claiming that the Centre's revocation of Article 370 & demonetisation had failed to check terror in the valley, he said that the consequences were being borne by civilians. Two teachers -  Deepak Chand and Supinder Kaur were dragged from the classroom and shot dead by terrorists in Srinagar's Eidgah Sangam. Similarly, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor argued that the recent killing has shown that insecurity is growing despite govt's much-touted gains. Batting for a better Kashmir policy, he condemned the killings. Manish Tewari, on the other hand, claimed that Pakistan via its proxies was targetting J&K and would next target Punjab. He also slammed the Centre for not taking note of Kashmir Pandit Sangharsh Samiti's earning regarding such attacks.  On Thursday, two school teachers - Supinder Kaur (Principal) and Deepak Chand were dragged from the classroom and shot dead by the terrorists in Eidgah Sangam, a downtown area of Srinagar. The two victims - residents of Allochi Bagh - were working in Government Boys Higher Secondary School. As per reports, the terrorists had lined up all teachers of the school, checked their ID cards and mobile phones, before gunning down the Sikh and Hindu teachers - Kaur & Chand. Later, the Resistance Front (TRF) an offshoot of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) took responsibility for the attack. In its letter, the TRF stated that it killed the teachers for allegedly asking the parents to send their children for August 15 celebrations at the school. The TRF also claimed that it does not target innocents or civilians, but the ones who 'collaborate' with the Government of India. In addition, the TRF has once against warned that domicile holders and people who collaborate with the Government will be targeted. Among other warnings, the TRF has also asserted that people should install and use CCTV cameras outside their homes or shops. The TRF has refuted a 'religious angle' to the attack after killing two minority teachers.  This attack comes days after three civilians were shot dead by terrorists in Srinagar. Terrorists first gunned down a prominent Kashmiri Pandit named Makhan Lal Bindroo outside his pharmacy in Srinagar, near Iqbal Park. Then, Virender Paswan - a street vendor from Bihar - was gunned down near Madina Chowk Lalbazar area of Srinagar and Mohd Shafi Lone - a resident of Naidkhai was shot dead in Bandipora District.

According to a report circulated on Channel 12, the Isreali PM Naftali Bennett-led administration issued a warning which stated that Israeli diplomats were at risk of being targeted by the Islamic Republic. The alert reportedly came after three suspects of an attack-which the zionist blame on Iran-fled Cyprus.  Both Israel and Iran continue to trade barbs over a variety of subjects and have often blamed each other for ‘terror attacks.’ The Islamic Republic has blatantly accused its adversary of conducting aerial strikes on its marine vessel and its nuclear power plant. Meanwhile, Israel has said that Iran was behind a bombing on its embassy in India. Notably, a similar warning to Israeli citizens was sent previously in March by the country’s National Security Council.  Earlier this week, Israel accused Iran of plotting to kill Israelis in Cyprus after police there arrested a man suspected of carrying out terror attacks. In a statement, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s office said that “an act of terror was orchestrated by Iran against Israeli businesspeople” living on the island. However, it stopped short of admitting that the attack was targeted on Teddy Sagi.  Previously, Israel’s Channel 12 had reported that Sagi, who owes a giant debt to Russians, was the target of the attack but had fled the country after being tipped off. Interestingly, the now detained suspect was reported to be an Azeri, holding a Russian passport. Meanwhile, addressing media reporters Cypriot police chief Stelios Papatheodorou said that the suspect was arrested on 27 September in the country capital Nicosia when he was trying to cross from Turkish controlled North to south.  Ever since its establishment, the state of Israel has been involved in a shadow war with Iran. For years, both have traded barbs in international summits and blamed each other for killing officials by launching explosions. Israel has accused Iran of perpetuating terrorism and flouting nuclear guidelines to alter the status quo in the middle east in its favour. Meanwhile, Tehran has accused the Jewish leadership of being the regional bully and killing its top nuclear scientist. Additionally, the Islamic leadership has also accused the zionist intelligence and security forces of conspiring and executing secret operations on Iranian territory.    (Image: AP)"

Following India's independence from the British in 1947, the name Royal Indian Air Force was retained and served in the name of the Dominion of India. However, three years later, in 1950, with the government's transition to a Republic, the prefix Royal was omitted. IAF since 1950 has participated in four wars with Pakistan and one with China.

According to BBC, the compromise deal between the Democratic leaders and the Republicans extended the debt ceiling until early December, giving legislators more time to work out a potential longer-term agreement. With a 50-48 vote, the US senators agreed to increase the borrowing limit by $480 billion, which is sufficient to prevent the federal government from defaulting by keeping debt payments up until 3 December.  The latest announcement came amidst fears that the US would default on its national debt, with catastrophic global implications. Top officials had warned that the government would run out of cash and be unable to pay its debts by 18 October unless legislators passed a law raising the borrowing limit that the US Treasury Department can issue. However, Thursday’s announcement would now push the deadline to December. The bill will be sent to the House of Representatives for approval before it can be sent to US President Joe Biden for his signature.  Before the vote was held, Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer had said that deal had reached an agreement. His Republican counterpart Mitch McConnell separately had announced that the negotiations were in “good faith”.  Notably, the agreement comes less than two weeks before 18 October, the day the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned was the deadline to prevent the first-ever default. Now, even though the deadline has been pushed forward, the US lawmakers would still have to address the issue near December in a bid to avert default. According to BBC, if the US defaults on debts, analysts say that it would severely hurt the country’s credit rating, plunge the global financial system into turmoil and possibly even lead to a self-inflicted recession.  The federal government spends more money than it collects in taxes, therefore, it borrows money to make up for the shortfall. This borrowing is done via the US Treasury department. Back in 1939, Congress had established an aggregate limit or “ceiling” on how much debt the government can accumulate.  This limit has been lifted on a number of occasions in a bid to allow the federal government to borrow more. The US Congress often acts on it in a bipartisan manner. However, several Republicans have repeatedly voiced frustration around the new spending proposals that Democrats are trying to push. The Democrats have pointed that the rising debt limit is about paying off existing obligations rather than playing for new ones. They have even informed that President Biden’s policies have only contributed to three per cent of existing debts. "

After the first leg of the tournament in India, Mumbai Indians were fourth on the table and looked like almost scrapping through to the playoffs. However poor performance in the second leg has put the Mumbai Indians playoff chances in jeopardy. Following the start of the IPL 2021 UAE leg, Mumbai Indians lost three matches on the trot before bouncing back with 2 wins from the next 3 matches. They hammered Rajasthan Royals by a huge margin to keep their hopes alive of qualifying for the playoff spot but Kolkata Knight Riders win over Rajasthan Royals has dented all their hopes but still keeps them in hunt. The defending champions are chasing a hat-trick of titles and to qualify for playoffs they will have to overcome the Sunrisers Hyderabad challenge on Friday. Fans will get to witness a doubleheader fixture on Friday wherein two matches will be played simultaneously for the first time in the history of the tournament. Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore will take on each other in the other match on Friday. Mumbai Indians are currently sitting at the 6th spot with 12 points but their Net Run Rate is -0.048 while Kolkata Knight Riders boosted their net run rate to +0.587 after their victory over Rajasthan Royals on Thursday. The equation for Mumbai Indians is quite simple - they need to beat already-eliminated Sunrisers Hyderabad by 171 runs in Sharjah on Friday to qualify for the IPL 2021 Playoff. While bowling first will not be of any importance, Mumbai Indians will be hoping to win the toss and bat first in order to put up a huge total on board for bowlers to defend. Fans have seen miracles happening in IPL history and defending champions Mumbai Indians are looking to do the impossible on the last day of the league stage matches despite having a slim chance for qualification. Mumbai Indians fans would have prayed for KKR loss on Thursday however Eoin Morgan's men blew away Rajasthan Royals in a one-sided contest."

It is quite common in politics. There is nothing unexpected in it"".

Speculation about Mukul Roy's political future started doing the rounds after Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari pipped him to the Leader of the Opposition's post. An accused in the Narada sting operation case, Mukul Roy had resigned from TMC in September 2017 and joined BJP two months later. While the then BJP national vice-president won the Krishnanagar Uttar seat in Nadia district, his son Subhrangshu who joined the party in May 2019 was defeated from the Bijpur seat from where he was the incumbent MLA. Thereafter, Roy's son stirred controversy after writing on social media that one should do self-introspection before criticising the government which has come to power with people's support. Finally, Roy and his son rejoined TMC in the presence of CM Mamata Banerjee and her nephew on June 11."

The day will witness a scintillating air display by various aircraft including heritage, modern and frontline fighter jets in a parade-cum-investiture ceremony at the IAF's base in Hindan, Ghaziabad. The spellbinding aerobic display will commence with skydivers of the Akash Ganga team dropping out of an AN-32 aircraft in colourful canopies. It would be followed by performances by 47 Squadron deploying Mig-29 UPG aircraft, 116 Helicopter Unit with the Advanced Light Helicopter Mark IV Rudra and 2255 Squadron Det Air Force. On the occasion of IAF's 89th anniversary, here is the full list of active aircraft of the Indian Air Force, as per the World Directory of Modern Military Aircraft--  Out of the 27 active aircraft, here are the leading jets that are a part of the IAF's dynamic fighter fleet- The MiG 21 is one of the most known fighter jets across the world and has served in over 60 countries in the last six decades. Owing to the increased number of accidents that the fighter plane has witnessed in recent times, India is planning to gradually retire the last of its MiG 21s over the next 3-4 years.  Sukhoi Su-30MKI is one of the most advanced fighter jets in India's possession and is the current backbone and frontline fighter of the IAF. The aircraft is used as the primary air-to-air and air-to-ground strike machine.  The Mirage-2000, first commissioned in 1985, is one of the most versatile and deadliest aircraft. In India, the aircraft has been dubbed as 'Vajra' which refers to the thunderbolt weapon wielded by God Indra. Mirage 2000 aircraft played a crucial role in India's victory over the iconic Tiger Hill during the Kargil War.  In the 1980s, the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) started the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme to replace the ageing Soviet-sourced MiG-21. In January 2021, the Defence Ministry signed a Rs 48,00 cr deal with HAL to acquire 83 LCA-Tejas Mk1A aircrafts  The SEPECAT Jaguar or 'Shamsher' is a fighter jet jointly developed by British Royal Air Force and French Air Force. Currently, it is only being used by the Indian Air Force in an upgraded version and serves as its primary ground attack aircraft. The MiG 29 was produced by the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau in the 1970s to counter US F-Series planes like F-15 and F-16. In India, the MiG29 is known as 'Baaz' (Hawk) and forms the second line of defence after the Sukhoi Su-30MKI. The induction of French-made 4.5 generation Rafale aircraft is being witnessed as a gamechanger for India. The twin-engine jets are capable of a diverse range of missions from ground and sea attacks to air defence and nuclear strike deterrence.
India had signed an agreement with France to procure 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore."

The Constitutional Tribunal said that some of EU treaty articles were incompatible with Poland’s constitution, BBC reported. The ruling said that the attempt by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to involve itself with Polish legal mechanisms “violates the rules that give priority to the constitution and rules that respect sovereignty amid the process of European integration"".  The Constitutional Tribunal said that Polish law can take precedence over EU law. The decision by Poland’s top court came after Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki requested a review of the decision by ECJ that gave bloc’s laws primacy. The court looked specifically at the compatibility of provisions from EU treaties with Poland’s constitution.  The ruling by the ECJ in March, on the other hand, said that the European Union can force member states to disregard certain provisions in national law, including constitutional law. The ECJ had also said that Poland’s recently implemented procedure for appointing members of the Supreme Court amounts to a violation of the bloc's law. However, in response to the ECJ ruling, Poland’s PM legally challenged the primacy of EU law.  Following Poland’s court ruling, several EU leaders and institutions reacted angrily to the court ruling with the president of the European Parliament David Sassoli, calling on the European Commission to “take the necessary action”. The EU’s executive body said that the decision raised “serious concerns”. In a statement, the European Commission said that the EU law has primacy over national laws, including constitutional provisions.  While reaffirming the primacy of EU law, the statement also said that the European Union is a community of values and of law, which must be upheld in all member states. It added that the rights of Europeans under the treaties must be protected, no matter where they live in the EU. “The European Commission has the task of safeguarding the proper functioning of the Union's legal order and it will continue to ensure that,” the bloc said.

Speaking at the Kerala Assembly, Sivankutty said, “The government is committed to ensuring no student goes hungry. The mid-day meal will be given in schools when it reopens.""   Minister Sivankutty went on to say that only two kids would be permitted to sit on a bench due to the COVID-19 protocols. He added that the Education Department's COVID-19 rules should be followed by all Kerala schools. The Kerala Minister said that soaps, as well as hand sanitiser, should be given by the school administration. A thermal scanner should be installed in every classroom to verify the temperature.  The minister further reveals that as the state government is preparing a shift wise system, so, Saturday will also be a working day for schools. He also said that numerous meetings were held, including those with the parents-teachers associations, various unions, and the heads of municipal bodies. He also explained that the purpose of the meetings is to make sure that the students who will be coming to schools adhere to COVID guidelines. A bio-bubble system is being developed in the schools.    Sivankutty said that all schools are being cleaned and disinfected. ""All political parties had joined to clean school premises as it is after a long gap that children are joining schools,"" he added.

The development comes as an attempt to control the single largest party in the state assembly by pushing the elder siblings to the margins in an intra-family feud. Further, the move is seen as sidelining of the older siblings in the party founded and headed by the father who has made little secret of his preference for Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, younger son and the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly. The party's principal national secretary-general Abdul Bari Siddiqui has signed the campaigners' list that comprises of 20 names, including Lalu Prasad, who is now out of jail and will canvass for his party's candidates for Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan assembly constituencies only if his health permits.  Prasad's wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi, a demure housewife-turned-politician is another notable omission. Lately, she was found more content playing the role of the family matriarch that often betrays hints of being torn apart by competing ambitions of her children. RJD sources revealed that much shouldn't be anticipated from the development as those who aren't listed for under campaigners can canvass for the party provided the candidate in the fray is willing to foot the expenses. Currently, BJP is the principal rival of RJD in the state who took on the opportunity to fish in troubled waters. State BJP spokesman and national general secretary of OBC morcha Nikhil Anand said in a statement RJD has finally signalled that both Tej Pratap Yadav and Misa Bharti are no longer desired by their own party and they must fend for themselves. Misa, a Rajya Sabha member, looks unlikely to be considered for another term while Tej Pratap has already floated his own organization.  The Congress too is hopeful of getting something out of the intra-family dynamics that control its bigger ally with RJD's unilateral announcement of candidates for Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan. While Ashok ram, who had earlier contested the reserved Kusheshwar Asthan seat in the assembly polls and whose son Atirek is the candidate for the upcoming by-poll, is expected to rope in Tej Pratap for the Congress campaign. On the other hand, the Left Front has announced its full support to the RJD in the upcoming Nihar by-polls as they are furious over former JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar switching over to the Congress.  The five-party Grand Alliance helmed by the RJD comprises of the CPI(ML) Liberation, the CPI and the CPI (M) who together have about 20 MLAs along with the Congress.  Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, whose JD(U) in the assembly polls had won both the seats, when asked about his response over infighting in the opposition camp, said, ""It is for you journalists to analyze"".  The JD(U) has announced the candidate list for both the seats, which it seeks to retain with the backing of the BJP and smaller NDA partners like the Hindustani Awam Morcha and Vikassheel Insaan Party. On October 30, voting is scheduled to take place and results will be announced on November 2. "

With CSK having played all their 14 matches in the league stage, Virat Kohli-led Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) still have to play one more game. With one more game to go, Virat Kohli & team will be eyeing the crucial second position in order to come into the top 2 of the IPL 2021 points table.  The top 2 teams on the points table enjoy the luxury to play two qualifiers while teams on 3rd and 4th have to play an eliminator first. Then, the winner of the eliminator plays Qualifier 2- the losing team of Qualifier 1 in order to go into the final of the Indian Premier League. Now, RCB which lost its previous match still has a slight chance to finish the IPL league stage on number 2.  As per ESPNcricinfo, for RCB to climb to the second spot and for CSK to drop to the third, the Virat Kohli-led squad has to score around 200 runs and win by a margin of 163 runs. In addition, RCB cannot go past the CSK by chasing the target i.e. by bowling first. It is pertinent to mention here that the biggest winning margin in IPL so far is 146 runs which was registered by Mumbai Indians against Delhi Capitals (then Delhi Daredevils) in 2017.   The Royal Challengers Bangalore is currently at the third spot with 16 points in 13 matches, while the Delhi Capitals sits on top with 20 points. On the other hand, CSK in 14 matches has 18 points.  As per IPL's official website, ""A team’s net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team throughout the season, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the season."" The rules further state, "" In the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall be based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in which the team was dismissed."" For example, if team X has scored 179 runs in 20 overs, then its RR is 8.95 and if team Y has scored 180 in 19 overs then its RR will be 9.47. Therefore the final NRR will be 0.52. The Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) will take on Delhi Capitals on Friday and will look to create history in order to be inducted in the top two teams. In terms of head-to-head record, RCB and DC  have clashed on 26 occasions, with Virat Kohli-led squad leading 15-10, while one match has ended up in no-result. "

The anonymous posters increasingly harass and bully online, making the unregulated platforms unhealthy for the users. The Australian government now wants them identified as it calls on Facebook and other platforms to take accountability for such defamation online. Morrison’s warnings come in the aftermath of Canberra stating earlier this year that it will oblige Google and Facebook to pay for journalism on social networking sites.  Those who post defamatory comments without disclosing their identification should be held liable for those comments, Morrison stated, according to Associated Press. He added, that it was time that Facebook held accountability for such behaviour. “Cowards who go anonymously on to social media and vilify people, and harass them, and bully them, and engage in defamatory statements, they need to be responsible for what they’re saying,” Morrison was quoted as saying. “Social media has become a coward’s palace where people can just go on there, not say who they are, destroy people’s lives and say the foulest and offensive things to people, and do so with impunity,” he added. Australian high courts had set to rewrite the country’s defamation laws earlier last month. They mandated that the media outlets be held liable for defamatory comments posted by third parties on their Facebook pages. American social media conglomerate corporation, Facebook had earlier threatened Australian regulators of not letting users post news content in the country as the Scott Morrison government prepared for a new law that would force the social network to pay the publishers for their articles. The regulators in Australia have wanted the tech giants including Facebook and Google to pay for the content that is reposted from the news outlets. While Google warned its users that its search services could be “dramatically worse” as the result of the law (if passed), Facebook has said that the draft of new regulation “ misunderstands the dynamics of the internet”."

The two Mughal-era gemstones from India could sell for up to $3.5 million. They each come from an unknown “princely treasury” and comprise mesmeric “Gate of Paradise” glasses that are drop-shaped into two, and consist of flat-cut emeralds that may be weighing an estimated 27 carats. The design is set in silver and gold, and the lenses are approximately 2.6 cm x 2 cm x 0.295 cm.  According to Sotheby’s the spectacles originated in 17th century Mughal India, where they were commissioned by an unknown prince. The jewellery has symbolic significance from the Indian perspective as such gems find mention in Ratna Shastras and are widely treasured. The rose-cut diamond on the jewellery weighs more than 200 carats and an emerald weighs at least 300 carats and was designed around 1890. While the original patron of gemstones is unknown, the auction centre states that they “would no doubt have been in the reserve of an emperor.” In an episode of Expert Voices, shared by London’s auction centre, writer and historian William Dalrymple describes how the diamonds were commissioned by one of the Emperors from the great Mughal period. The jewellery may have been designed for enlightenment and ward off evil, experts believe, and they go on sale after they toured New York, Hong Kong and London, reports reveal. According to the chairman of Sotheby's Middle East and India, Edward Gibbs the pieces are an exceptionally rare example of India’s Mughal jewellery craftsmanship. “There are no others like them,"" the latter told CNN. The glasses ""could only have belonged"" to an emperor, his inner circle or a high-ranking courtier, the outlet quoted Gibbs as saying. Diamonds had symbolic significance with ""celestial light"" and ""enlightenment"" during the primitive Indic society, and the gemstones were believed to be the  ""vehicles for astral forces"" that could channel the auspicious intentions of the universe, Gibbs also reportedly said.  The green colour also holds significance as it links to peace and paradise, salvation, and eternal life in Islam, the religion of the Mughal rulers. The experience may have ""led you through the gateway into paradise"" by offering ""a glimpse of the verdant sea of the green paradise that awaits,"" Gibbs told the network. The Indian subcontinent was widely known for its reserves of gems and jewellery and the Mughals had made attempts to acquire and rule on more territory and be in possession of these treasures. Several court paintings throw light on the intricate details about the variety of gems treasured by the Mughal leaders. "

On Thursday, The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences took to its Twitter handle to declare the selection of the Nobel Prize for Literature in a news conference. Tanzanian novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah received the award “for his uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents.”  Rushdie, meanwhile, in a Twitter post said that some years ago, Abdulrazak Gurnah had assisted in editing a Cambridge Companion for him. While he said he was “grateful” to Abdulrazak Gurnah at the time, the author added that Gurnah has “only gone and won the Nobel Prize.” Rushdie then went on to add: “Many congratulations.”  Gurnah was born on one of Zanzibar's islands and came to England as a refugee in the 1960s. Following the peaceful liberation from the UK’s colonial rule in December 1963, when Zanzibar went through a revolution under the regime of President Abeid Karume, it led to the oppression and persecution of citizens of Arab origin. However, Gurnah belonged to the victimized ethnic group and was forced to leave his family and his country, which was called the Republic of Tanzania. He was unable to return to Zanzibar until 1984.  He began writing about his experiences as a refugee when he was 21 years old and lived in exile in England. The identity and self-image of his itinerant characters are central to his representation of the refugee experience, in his works. Despite the fact that Swahili was his native tongue, English became his literary weapon. The characters in his works are more frequently based in Tanzania. While his writing dates back to his exile period, Gurnah's works are about his relationship with the place he left behind — his country of Zanzibar, Tanzania. The 73-year-old author of 10 novels including well-renowned works such as ‘Paradise’ and ‘Desertion,’ received 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.14m / £840,000).   "
