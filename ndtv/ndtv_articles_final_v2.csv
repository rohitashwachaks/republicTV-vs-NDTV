""if the national governments of china and the us are not able to agree on anything of substance, i think there may well be room for serious action anyway, because both countries are able and willing to do a lot on their own,"" said mary nichols, who led major climate initiatives as chair of the california air resources board. ""but that doesn't mean that it's irrelevant,"" she said. ""without an explicit agreement, other countries will be reluctant to act."" us president joe biden's administration has described beijing as his country's top long-term challenge and raised pressure on concerns from human rights to taiwan to trade but has sought engagement on climate. ""it is not a mystery that china and the us have many differences. but on climate, cooperation -- it is the only way to break freefrom the world's current mutual suicide pact,"" john kerry, the us climate envoy, said in a recent speech. 'race to top'? kerry has traveled twice to china despite a chill in relations. but on his latest visit, foreign minister wang yi issued a warning. ""it is impossible for china-us climate cooperation to be elevated above the overall environment of china-us relations,"" wang said. the remarks raised concern in washington that the biden-kerry approach could backfire, allowing china to use climate as leverage. but chinese president xi jinping soon afterward took a major step by telling the united nations that beijing would stop funding coal in its overseas infrastructure-building blitz, although it is still investing at home in the dirty but politically sensitive form of energy. alex wang, faculty co-director of the emmett institute on climate change and the environment at the university of california, los angeles, said that china and the united states could engage in a ""race to the top"" on who does more. ""it improves china's global reputation to appear as a positive actor on climate,"" wang said. ""if the leaders in china feel like they are becoming laggards, i think it would lead to some pressure to act further, and it would be a reason to disregard the voices from fossil fuel industries or coal industry within the country,"" he said. ""but without the pressure then the balance shifts in favor of slower action."" he drew a contrast with biden's predecessor donald trump, whose climate skepticism meant little pressure on beijing to tackle coal. potentially powerful steps nichols, who helped design california's cap-and-trade program that creates a market with incentives for reducing emissions, said one major step would be if china agreed to link efforts to set a common price on carbon. ""that would, i think, send an extraordinarily strong signal to investors and businesses around the world,"" said nichols, now a fellow at columbia university's center on global energy policy. california already has linked its market to quebec, taking a lead in action even before biden's election. with so many areas of tension between the united states and china, a multilateral process such as cop26 may be more effective in any case than bilateral talks, said jacob stokes, a fellow at the center for a new american security. ""neither side wants to be seen as doing this as some sort of favor to the other side,"" he said. and with china already the world's second-largest economy, stokes said that us policymakers may want to focus climate diplomacy on poorer nations.   ""is it more important to expend effort to get concessions from beijing or to try to finance expansion of clean power in the rest of the developing world that still has a lot more energy-intensive development to do?""

""today, i am sorry to say this, lots of modern women in india want to stay single. even if they get married, they don't want to give birth. they want surrogacy. so there is a paradigm shift in our thinking, which is not good,"" he said during the world mental health day at the national institute of mental health and neurological sciences (nimhans). lamenting the ""western influence"" on indian society, the minister said people are not willing to let their parents be with them. ""unfortunately, today we are going in a western way. we don't want our parents to live with us, forget about grandparents being with us,"" the minister said. speaking about mental health in india, mr sudhakar said every seventh indian has some kind of mental issue, which could be mild, moderate and severe. however, according to him, stress management is an art and indian need not have to learn but preach the world how to handle it. ""stress management is an art. this art we need not learn as indians. we need to preach to the world how to handle stress, because yoga, meditation and pranayama are the wonderful tools which our ancestors had taught the world thousands of years back,"" he said. about covid and mental health, mr sudhakar said the relatives were not able to touch the bodies of their near and dear ones, which caused them mental agony.

""we are the only country which is offering vaccines free of cost. elsewhere, people are made to pay between â‚¹ 1,500 to â‚¹ 4,000 per vaccine,"" mr sudhakar said.

Here's The Answer,"the transition towards cleaner energy has made progress but not quick enough to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees celsius, as agreed in the 2015 paris climate agreement. while the covid pandemic initially caused a drop in greenhouse gas emissions as economic activity dropped, the pandemic may not have accelerated the shift to renewables: renewables boom renewables are now the number two source of electricity in the world with a 26 percent share in 2019 -- behind coal, but ahead of natural gas and nuclear. wind and solar power have grown at annual rates of 22 and 36 percent, respectively as their prices have plunged since 1990. even during the pandemic, 26 gigawatts (gw) of capacity was added last year, setting a new record, according to the international renewable energy agency (irena). but the use of fossil fuels in final consumption (electricity, transportation fuel, heating and factory production) has held steady. at 80.3 percent in 2009, it was still 80.2 percent in 2019, as overall energy consumption increases thanks to population growth as well as rising incomes in asia. sharp turn by automakers pushed by tighter pollution regulations, leading automakers are aiming to scrap internal combustion engines within the next decade or sharply cut their production as they shift towards all-electric futures. roads are still crowded with polluting cars: electric vehicles only make up five percent of new units sold. the international energy agency says consumers continue to prefer big suvs -- they accounted for 42 percent of sales in 2020 -- that pollute more than smaller models. hydrogen from australia to china to the eu, more and more nations are setting their sites on green hydrogen for lorries and factories. while burning hydrogen as a fuel emits just water, most of the gas is made in a process that produces harmful emissions. finding cost effective ways to produce hydrogen cleanly and developing the infrastructure for its use will require more effort, with the iea urging a quadrupling of investments in the sector. carbon pricing in mid-2020 some 44 countries and 31 cities accounting for 60 percent of global economic output had carbon pricing (taxes or quotas) schemes in place, according to the i4ce think tank. carbon prices aim to make polluters pay for some of the social costs of emissions such as health care costs due to poor air quality and crop damage due to climate change. experts say the price needs to be between $40 and $80 per tonne of co2 to push polluters to increase efficiency or shift to renewable energy sources. however, the price is under $10 for 75 percent of covered emissions. pandemic investment the ren 21 think tank said the covid pandemic provided an opportunity to shift public policy, but countries provided six times as much investment money to fossil fuel than renewable energy projects in their economic recovery plans. after dropping by seven percent thanks to the pandemic, co2 emissions are expected to hit new records by 2023 if those investments are not shifted. emerging difficulties investment in renewable energy has been sliding for several years in emerging and developing nations except for china, and the covid pandemic has done nothing to change the situation. these countries hold two-thirds of the world's population and are responsible for 90 percent of the growth in emissions, but they are receiving only 20 percent of investments into clean energy, according to the iea. king coal still reigns long ago baptised ""king coal"" for its outsize role in powering the world economy, the fuel remains in wide use in asia to meet the growing needs for electricity in the region. the global economic recovery means that coal demand is likely to surpass its 2019 level and thus also retain its crown of being the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions.   china, which has been a major financer of coal projects in other nations, announced in september it is halting the practice.

""us citizens who are at or near the serena hotel should leave immediately,"" the us state department said, citing ""security threats"" in the area. ""in light of the increased risks you are advised not to stay in hotels, particularly in kabul (such as the serena hotel),"" britain's foreign, commonwealth and development office added. since the taliban takeover, many foreigners have left afghanistan, but some journalists and aid workers remain in the capital. the well-known serena, a luxury hotel popular with business travellers and foreign guests, has twice been the target of attacks by the taliban. in 2014, just weeks before the presidential election, four teenage gunmen with pistols hidden in their socks managed to penetrate several layers of security, killing nine people, including an afp journalist and members of his family. in 2008, a suicide bombing left six dead. us aid pledge discussed in august, during a chaotic evacuation of foreign nationals and at-risk afghans, nato countries issued a chorus of warnings about an imminent threat, telling people to stay away from kabul airport. hours later, a suicide bomber detonated in a crowd gathered around one of the airport gates, killing scores of civilians and 13 american troops. the attack was claimed by is, which has since targeted several taliban guards, and claimed a devastating bomb attack in kunduz city on friday that ripped through a mosque during friday prayers -- the bloodiest assault since us forces left the country in august. in recent years, the isis's afghanistan-pakistan chapter has been responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in those countries -- massacring civilians at mosques, shrines, public squares and even hospitals. the terror threat has partly overshadowed taliban efforts to improve their international standing. over the weekend, senior taliban and us delegations held their first face-to-face talks in the qatar capital doha since the us withdrawal. the talks ""focused on security and terrorism concerns and safe passage for us citizens, other foreign nationals and our afghan partners,"" according to state department spokesman ned price. ""human rights, including the meaningful participation of women and girls in all aspects of afghan society,"" were also raised, price said in a statement. according to the state department, the discussions were ""candid and professional"" and us officials reiterated that ""the taliban will be judged on its actions, not only its words"". the taliban said the united states had agreed to send aid to afghanistan, though the us said the issue had only been discussed, and that any assistance would go to the afghan people and not the taliban government.   ""us representatives stated that they will give humanitarian assistance to afghans and will provide facilities for other humanitarian organisations to deliver aid,"" the taliban's foreign ministry said, warning that the aid should not be linked to political issues.

31,Mon Oct 11 04:39:18 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: Can Nuclear Power Save Us From Climate Change? Experts Weigh In https://t.co/hCSLGKLaxk https://t.co/Kc5WBRapzq,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/can-nuclear-power-help-save-us-from-climate-change-know-it-from-experts-2571147,2,0,Can Nuclear Power Save Us From Climate Change? Experts Weigh In,"for its supporters, nuclear energy is the world's best -- perhaps only -- hope to avoid catastrophic climate change. opponents say it is too expensive, too risky and totally unnecessary. standing between the two camps are those who see atomic power as a necessary evil that will buy the time needed to develop cleaner and safer alternatives. ""we don't have the luxury of choosing one or the other,"" said fatih birol, executive director of the international energy agency, which advises developed countries. it's a hotly contested debate that continues to divide specialists and policymakers alike. unlike wind, solar and hydropower, nuclear plants do not depend on often unreliable climatic factors. a combination of drought and low winds, for example, has been blamed for the recent surge in natural gas prices that is stoking demand for dirty alternatives such as coal and oil. still, nuclear stations are plagued by high construction costs -- with recent projects taking longer to complete and blowing out budgets -- as well as the thorny problem of disposing of highly toxic waste and decommissioning power stations. on the plus side, nuclear reactors create massive amounts of power with no direct emissions of carbon dioxide. even taking into account the emissions associated with mining uranium for fuel and the concrete, steel and other materials used in construction, nuclear power emits very few greenhouse gases: much less than coal or gas, and even less than solar, according to some studies. 'absolutely vital'  ""everything that brings emissions down is good news,"" said birol. the iea says nuclear power has avoided about 55 gigatonnes of co2 emissions over the past five decades -- about two years of global energy-related emissions of the greenhouse gas. for those reasons, nuclear energy accounts for a bigger share of the world power mix in most of the scenarios put forward by the ipcc -- the un's climate experts -- to hold average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees celsius above where they were at the end of the 19th century.  the international atomic energy agency -- whose mission includes the promotion of nuclear power -- has raised its projections for the first time since the 2011 disaster at japan's fukushima power plant, and now expects installed capacity to double by 2050 under the most favourable scenario. nuclear power is ""absolutely vital in our efforts to achieve net zero emissions,"" iaea director general rafael mariano grossi said.  that's a central objective of the next major climate conference, cop26, to be held in glasgow in november.  but while some countries -- most notably china -- are building new reactors, others are shuttering old ones: 5.5 gigawatts of capacity were installed worldwide in 2019 while 9.4 gw were permanently closed, the iea says. the divide runs through the european union: while germany decided to phase out nuclear power after fukushima, countries such as poland and the czech republic see it as a way to reduce dependence on coal.  ""in the czech republic, nuclear energy is seen as a reliable and relatively cheap source of electricity,"" said wadim strielkowski, an energy expert at the prague business school. this division is reflected in the debate in brussels about whether or not to include nuclear power in the green ""taxonomy"", the classification of activities deemed good for the climate and the environment.
false economy opponents of nuclear power such as greenpeace have put aside their traditional arguments -- stemming from pacifism and fears about nuclear waste -- to focus on efficiency calculations.   the costs of renewables have been falling steadily while major nuclear projects are expensive and have suffered major overruns. ""spending money today on new nuclear power worsens the climate crisis, because investments are not being made in what is cheaper, faster and therefore more efficient,"" said mycle schneider, author of a critical annual report on nuclear. however, the nuclear industry has another trick up its sleeve.   for some years now, it has been betting heavily on small modular reactors (smrs): simpler, mass-produced in factories, they are less likely to go awry than huge construction sites.
so far, only russia has commissioned this technology -- for a groundbreaking floating plant. still, there are signs of interest from other countries.
""the future of nuclear energy, whether in the czech republic or elsewhere in the world, could be small reactors,"" said strielkowski.  (except for the headline, this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

""it will take us at least three months, and perhaps as long as six months, to get there,"" lee said in an address to the nation, which has largely kept the virus at bay since last year with masks, contact tracing and a closed border. ""after this surge stabilises, we may still see future surges, especially if new variants emerge. we may have to tap on the brakes again if cases again grow too fast, to protect our healthcare system and healthcare workers,"" lee said. the government will tighten rules for those who remain unvaccinated from wednesday, barring them from entering malls and eating at the country's ubiquitous hawker centres. it will review some covid curbs in a week or two. singapore's travel programme for fully vaccinated people began in september with germany and brunei, and will include south korea from next month. up to 3,000 travellers will able to enter daily through the vaccinated travel lanes, a far cry from the record 19.1 million travellers to the city-state in 2019. borders remain largely closed to key asian countries. singapore is discussing two-way quarantine-free travel with several more countries, the government said. ""we hope this further easing of measures and expansion of singapore's border reopening will spur other markets to similarly navigate their pathways towards restarting air travel,"" said philip goh, asia-pacific vice president for the international air transport association. singapore airlines said in a statement that it will expand its vaccinated travel lane networks to 14 cities. the flagship carrier, which relies solely on international travel, lost a record s$4.27 billion ($3.15 billion) in the year to march, its second year in the red. singapore's changi airport was among the world's busiest in 2019, with more than 68 million passengers, before travel crashed last year due to the pandemic. ""since the singapore economy is extremely dependent on external demand for our goods and services, very simply put, any moves that help to lift the number of flights handled by changi airport will add to our gdp,"" said song seng wun, an economist at cimb private banking. the country has hit some hiccups on its transition to an endemic covid as the population was focussed on avoiding it for nearly two years. its leader said the high vaccination coverage meant people will be better protected from the virus, which is likely to infect nearly everyone.   ""let us go about our daily activities as normally as possible, taking necessary precautions,"" lee said. ""we should respect covid but we must not be paralysed by fear.

""a shortage of workers can mean people's health and well being. it's scary,"" greyson said. however, greyson added, ""we're in an ethical situation where it's also scary not to ensure that all health workers are vaccinated. so it's a bit of a catch-22."" to tackle staff scarcity, at least one province is offering signing bonuses to nurses. provinces including quebec and british columbia have made it mandatory for healthcare workers and nursing staff to be vaccinated to continue working in their respective fields. modi justin trudeau also unveiled one of the strictest vaccine mandates in the world last week, saying unvaccinated federal employees will be sent on unpaid leave and making covid shots mandatory for air, train and ship passengers. layoffs have are started to hit, with one hospital in southern ontario last week dumping 57 employees, representing 2.5% of staff, after its vaccine mandate came into effect. a long-term care home in toronto put 36% of its staff on unpaid leave after they refused to get vaccinated, the canadian broadcasting corp reported. british columbia will place staff at its long-term care and assisted living sector on unpaid administrative leave if they fail to get at least one shot by monday. some 97% of long-term care staff in vancouver and the surrounding areas have at least one dose as of oct. 6, the province said. but northern b.c. has only 89% of staff with at least one dose, although the data was still being updated. the province recently changed the deadline, giving more time for people to receive their second vaccine dose. ""it is because we know we have a very limited healthcare resource,"" dr. bonnie henry, the province's medical officer, said. 'political' decision quebec is offering c$15,000 bonuses to help attract and retain about 4,300 full-time nurses. some 25,000 healthcare workers who are yet not fully vaccinated ahead of an oct. 15 deadline risk suspension without pay, said christian dubã©, the province's health minister. some 97% of all staff in university health network, which operates medical facilities in and around toronto, ontario, has been vaccinated ahead of oct. 22, with efforts underway to find backup for the remaining. daniel lublin, a toronto-based employment lawyer, called the mandates ""very political"" and based on the majority view that vaccines are good. ""the fallout is that it's another segment of the canadian workforce that is going to be faced with job loss if they choose not to vaccinate."" the public service alliance of canada (psac), which represents 215,000 federal workers, said while the union supports the government's vaccination stance, its members who do not get inoculated should not be punished. ""especially when remote work options are available that do not jeopardize the health and safety of co-workers and allow our members to continue to serve canadians,"" said chris aylward, psac president. treasury board, which oversees the public administration, is engaged with psac and other labor representatives about the implementation of the mandate, a government source said. louis hugo francescutti, an emergency room physician in edmonton, said he worked with several people who were continuing to refuse vaccination, even though it would cost them their jobs when the mandate takes effect on oct. 31. alberta has one of the lowest vaccination rates in canada, and its hospitals have been overwhelmed by the fourth wave.   ""we're so under the water right now that losing a couple of people who don't want to get vaccinated - it's going to be sad (but) the impact will be minimal,"" francescutti said.

""if coal supply doesn't improve, there will be a blackout in delhi in two days,"" the national capital's power minister satyendra jain said today. ""the coal-fired power plants that supply electricity to delhi have to keep a minimum coal stock of one month, but now it has come down to one day,"" mr jain said.

""there is politics going on. if you create a crisis, it will seem that some great work has been done by solving it,"" the delhi minister said. delhi has a 1,300 megawatt (mw) gas-fired power plant in bawana on the city's outskirts. ""all three companies in delhi are distributors and not power producers. we depend on the centre's plants. if the supply does not come, then after two days there will be a blackout in the whole of delhi,"" mr jain said. a reuters analysis of daily load despatch data from the central grid regulator showed india's power supply deficit in the first seven days of october amounted to 11.2 per cent of the country's total shortages throughout the year.   the data is publicly available but the analysis provides a first concrete indication of the extent of the problem. energy supplies are under strain globally as prices surge and demand and supply chains are strained by the recovery of consumption following lockdowns to contain the pandemic. mr kejriwal today tweeted he has written to modi modi for his intervention in making adequate arrangements of coal and gas to power plants supplying electricity to the city.

""a shortage of workers can mean people's health and well being. it's scary,"" greyson said. however, he added, ""we're in an ethical situation where it's also scary not to ensure that all health workers are vaccinated. so it's a bit of a catch-22."" to tackle staff scarcity, at least one province is offering signing bonuses to nurses. provinces including quebec and british columbia have made it mandatory for healthcare workers and nursing staff to be vaccinated to continue working in their respective fields. modi justin trudeau also unveiled one of the strictest vaccine mandates in the world last week, saying unvaccinated federal employees will be sent on unpaid leave and making covid shots mandatory for air, train and ship passengers. layoffs have are started to hit, with one hospital in southern ontario last week dumping 57 employees, representing 2.5% of staff, after its vaccine mandate came into effect. a long-term care home in toronto put 36% of its staff on unpaid leave after they refused to get vaccinated, the canadian broadcasting corp reported. british columbia will place staff at its long-term care and assisted living sector on unpaid administrative leave if they fail to get at least one shot by monday. some 97 per cent of long-term care staff in vancouver and the surrounding areas have at least one dose as of october 6, the province said. but northern bc has only 89% of staff with at least one dose, although the data was still being updated. the province recently changed the deadline, giving more time for people to receive their second vaccine dose. ""it is because we know we have a very limited healthcare resource,"" dr bonnie henry, the province's medical officer, said. 'political' decision quebec is offering c$15,000 bonuses to help attract and retain about 4,300 full-time nurses. some 25,000 healthcare workers who are yet not fully vaccinated ahead of an october 15 deadline risk suspension without pay, said christian dube, the province's health minister. some 97% of all staff in university health network, which operates medical facilities in and around toronto, ontario, has been vaccinated ahead of october 22, with efforts underway to find backup for the remaining. daniel lublin, a toronto-based employment lawyer, called the mandates ""very political"" and based on the majority view that vaccines are good. ""the fallout is that it's another segment of the canadian workforce that is going to be faced with job loss if they choose not to vaccinate."" the public service alliance of canada (psac), which represents 215,000 federal workers, said while the union supports the government's vaccination stance, its members who do not get inoculated should not be punished. ""especially when remote work options are available that do not jeopardize the health and safety of co-workers and allow our members to continue to serve canadians,"" said chris aylward, psac president. treasury board, which oversees the public administration, is engaged with psac and other labor representatives about the implementation of the mandate, a government source said. louis hugo francescutti, an emergency room physician in edmonton, said he worked with several people who were continuing to refuse vaccination, even though it would cost them their jobs when the mandate takes effect on octobr 31. alberta has one of the lowest vaccination rates in canada, and its hospitals have been overwhelmed by the fourth wave.   ""we're so under the water right now that losing a couple of people who don't want to get vaccinated - it's going to be sad (but) the impact will be minimal,"" francescutti said.

Expert Explains,"mental health or psychological disorders are quite common in this day and age we are living in. surveys suggest that around 14% of the population or 1 out of 7 individuals suffer from a psychological disorder. in india, this translates roughly to 200 million individuals. the most common mental health disorders are depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and substance abuse. about 50 million individuals in india suffer from depressive disorders and an equal number of people suffer from anxiety disorders. they can be seen across different stages in an individual's lifespan. however, depression, anxiety and eating disorders may be more commonly seen in women whereas substance abuse is more common in men. the elderly may be more prone to depressive disorders. it has also been seen that the underprivileged and uneducated population, may be more prone to psychological disorders. in children, an additional category of disorders such as developmental disorders may be seen. these include adhd (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), learning disabilities and autism spectrum disorders. the causes of psychological disorders can be clubbed into two main categories: biological and psychosocial. biological causes include factors such as heredity, medical conditions including neurological and endocrinological conditions and infectious diseases, instances of substance abuse in the family. most psychological disorders run in families. if one family has a psychological disorder, the chances of other family members having psychological disorders increases. many medical conditions are linked to mental health issues, these include parkinson's disease, dementia, stroke, endocrinological conditions such as thyroid and diabetes, other medical conditions as well as certain infections. substance abuse may lead to psychological problems and disorders. certain medications are also known to cause psychological problems. the other broad category includes psychosocial stressors. these include stresses early on in life during childhood such as physical, emotional and sexual abuse or neglect, dysfunctional family, parents suffering from substance abuse, too frequent changes of the environment such as change of schools. all of these can attribute to psychological issues later in life. the nature of our stressors changes as we progress into the later stages in our lives. later in life issues such as financial problems, job problems, relationship problems, health-related problems start creeping in. these may also lead to psychological problems or disorders. we have also recently witnessed how covid has become one of the most important stressors of our lives. it has led to psychological issues in a reasonable amount of people. despite the progress we have made, there continues to be stigma related to psychological issues. people do not recognize signs and symptoms as suggestive of a psychological disorder. they refuse to recognize these are serious illnesses just like medical disorders which can be treated by pharmacological and psychological methods. hence, there is a delay in seeking treatment. some attribute mental health problems to weakness of one's character. there are also a lot of myths related to the treatment of mental health issues. many believe these disorders do not have any treatment, while others believe medications are dangerous and can cause side effects. they think these medications are damaging to the brain or may numb the brain or be addictive. this is when people think willpower or strength and courage will help the individual 'deal with it. this again is quite toxic and delays proper treatment and resolution. some believe yoga and meditation alone can heal a mental health disorder. and while there is no doubt about the benefits of these activities, one must also understand the role that counselling, and medication cannot be replaced. they exist to help the individual in ways that cannot be substituted. some people also believe that they will need to take the medications for the rest of their lives, which is not the case. mental health can manifest themselves in these forms: 1. sleep disturbances: some people may have increased sleep, while some might have increased sleep 2. appetite: some might eat less, however, many might eat more. stress eating is extremely common, particularly, sweets and chocolates 3. mood disturbance: persistent sadness, persistent anxiety, dip in energy levels, irritable behaviour, easily triggered, easy fatigue, overthinking, negative thinking, crying spells 4. attention deficit, confusion, inability to take the decision 5. suicidal thoughts in more severe cases 6. heart palpitations 7. vague aches and pains in the body 8. headaches 9. gastrointestinal problems such as acidity, burning, bloating, nausea, pain in the upper abdominal area, diarrhoea and constipation 10. difficulty in breathing 11. suffocation coping mechanisms stress impacts us all. it is now a part of our lives. people deal with it in unique ways. however, the most impactful is timely and the right amount of sleep and nutrition. exercise is also known as an effective stress buster. around 30-40 minutes of exercise per day, half of it vigorous does wonders for our body and mind. adding meditation to these routines calms down the mind. social connectivity and interactions also help immensely. sharing and venting can be activities that take out half the stress out of the equation. so, connect with people, learn to be firm about impossible tasks and take care of your body through regular exercise. these can help an individual to sail through. however, when needed, do not shy away from asking for help. this is an awareness piece about common mental health issues and stress. there are many other serious mental health disorders such as psychosis disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders which require immediate medical attention. this awareness piece has touched upon some common methods by which you can keep your stress in control. this should not be seen as an exhaustive list. for more details, one should approach mental health professionals. never hesitate to seek help from a mental health expert. also encourage people around you to consult an expert if required.

""currently, most countries are spending orders of magnitude more funds subsidising activities that destroy biodiversity than we are spending on conserving it - this will have to change,"" he said. the united nations wants countries to commit to protecting 30% of their land by 2030, a pledge already agreed to by the united states and others. china has not yet made the commitment, despite implementing an ""ecological protection red line"" system that already puts 25 per cent of its territory out of the reach of developers. cooper told reporters that it was important all countries protected more of their ecosystems, but that would not be enough in itself to fix biodiversity loss, saying more commitments were required to manage the other 70 per cent. he said the global pandemic had injected new urgency into biodiversity protection, but warned that this was not yet reflected in ""business-as-usual"" covid stimulus measures.   ""we have to make sure... (the stimulus) is strengthening biodiversity and not adding to the problem,"" he said. ""globally, if you look around, the stimulus packages are making it worse rather than better.""

""get out there and vote, change your reality, for iraq and for your future,"" urged kadhemi, whose political future hangs in the balance, with few observers willing to predict who will come out on top after the lengthy backroom haggling that usually follows iraqi elections. but analysts are already predicting a record-low turnout for these polls, held a year early in a rare concession to the youth-led protest movement. dozens of anti-government activists have been killed, kidnapped or intimidated over the last couple of years, with accusations that pro-iran armed groups, many of which are represented in parliament, have been behind the violence.

""the election will likely result in another fragmented parliament, followed by opaque, corrupt horse-trading among factions to form the next government,"" said researchers bilal wahab and calvin wilder in an analysis published by the washington institute.   ""few expect this election to amount to more than a game of musical chairs, and the (october 2019 protest) movement's core demands -- curbing systemic corruption, creating jobs and holding armed groups accountable -- are unlikely to be met.""

""the more we achieve, the greater the pressure we face from china,"" tsai said in a speech marking taiwan's national day, adding: ""nobody can force taiwan to take the path china has laid out for us."" she described taiwan as ""standing on democracy's first line of defence"". ""we hope for an easing of... relations (with beijing) and will not act rashly, but there should be absolutely no illusions that the taiwanese people will bow to pressure,"" she added. the two sides have been ruled separately since the end of the chinese civil war in 1949. tensions have risen to their highest in decades under chinese president xi jinping, who broke off official communication with taipei following tsai's election five years ago and ramped up economic, diplomatic and military pressure. the latest flare-up has been a surge in flights by chinese fighter jets and nuclear-capable bombers into taiwan's air defence identification zone (adiz). some 150 sorties were made into the zone in the days surrounding china's own national day on 1 october -- a record number. ""complete reunification"" xi has made taking taiwan a key goal of his leadership which he looks set to extend to a third term in 2022. on saturday, he declared in a speech that ""the complete reunification of our country will be and can be realised"". he said he favoured ""peaceful reunification"" but his words come after months of increased military threats, including the recent surge in air incursions as well as heavily publicised military drills simulating an invasion of taiwan. last year, there were a record 380 sorties. there have already been more than 600 this year. the adiz is not the same as taiwan's territorial airspace. it includes a far greater area that overlaps with part of china's own air defence identification zone and even includes some of the mainland. tsai, who has won two elections, is loathed by beijing because she regards taiwan as an ""already independent"" country, not part of ""one china"". but she has also made no move to declare formal independence, something beijing has long warned would be a ""red line"" that would trigger an invasion. she has also made offers for talks with beijing that have been rejected. during sunday's speech, tsai reiterated her call for beijing ""to engage in dialogue on the basis of parity"" and said she supported maintaining the current status quo between the two neighbours. but she warned what happens to taiwan would have major regional and global repercussions. ""every step we take will influence our world's future direction, and our world's future direction will likewise affect the future of taiwan itself,"" she said. polling shows the vast majority of taiwanese have no desire to be ruled by beijing. most favour maintaining the status quo although there is a growing taiwanese nationalist sentiment, especially among younger people. china's crackdown in hong kong, a city beijing said would be a model for how it would rule taiwan, has also done little to endear taiwanese to assurances that their way of life would continue under communist party rule. ""as a taiwanese i don't think we can accept (reunification), just look at what happened in hong kong,"" hung chen-lun, who came with his two children to watch sunday's national day celebrations, told afp. chan yun-ching, another spectator, said many taiwanese simply felt helpless.   ""reunification now is not appropriate. but we are in no position to declare independence because the international community will not recognise us. it's useless,"" he said.

""jufri jawhar is the younger brother of adnan hasan damudi who was arrested for isis-related activities in 2016 and is currently under detention in a separate nia case,"" the agency said. jufri jawhar damudi was in touch with isis leadership, currently operating out of afghanistan-pakistan (af-pak) region who provided him propaganda material and also gave directions for its dissemination. ""for this purpose, jufri had created multiple pseudonymous ids on encrypted chat platforms and was also a member of various online propaganda channels of isis,"" the agency added. during earlier searches in the 'isis-voice of hind' case, nia claimed to have seized a large number of digital devices such as mobile phones, hard disks, sd cards etc. however, the second case in which the nia has been conducting raids is linked to bathindi ied recovery in which the agency had carried out searches on september 21 this year at eight locations in jammu and kashmir's anantnag, baramulla, kulgam, srinagar, doda and kishtwar districts. the case was initially registered on june 27 this year at bahu fort district jammu relating to the recovery of five kg ied from a lashkar-e-taiba terrorist in jammu's bathindi area on the same day.   the conspiracy by let was aimed at causing an explosion in jammu using the ied. nia had re-registered the case on july 19, and had earlier arrested three persons in this case. the investigation has revealed that pakistan-based handlers of proscribed terror outfit let and their associates based in j-k were planning terrorist activities in the union territory using the pseudo-acronym 'the resistance front', an offshoot of let, so as to maintain plausible deniability."

""reality of apartheid"" advocates for the palestinians have urged germany to demand an end to israel's occupation of the west bank and gaza strip that began in 1967. more than 600,000 israeli settlers have moved into the west bank and east jerusalem, which palestinians hope will become part of a future state. israel has maintained a blockade on gaza's two million residents since the islamist movement hamas seized control in 2007. omar shakir, israel and palestine director at human rights watch, criticised merkel for regarding israel's 54-year occupation as ""temporary"". ""maintaining this fiction has allowed the merkel government to avoid dealing with the reality of apartheid and persecution of millions of palestinians,"" he said in a statement. ""the new german government should put human rights at the centre of its israel and palestine policy,"" he added. after merkel's christian democratic union performed poorly in elections last month, the centre-left social democrats (spd) appear poised to head a new coalition as party negotiations continue. a rare point of difference between germany and israel is a 2015 deal that berlin signed to lift sanctions on iran in exchange for greater supervision of its nuclear programme.   israel is opposed to efforts by germany, the united states and other signatories to revive the deal after then us president donald trump withdrew from it in 2018.

""if coal supply doesn't improve, there will be a blackout in delhi in two days,"" the national capital's power minister satyendra jain said today. ""the coal-fired power plants that supply electricity to delhi have to keep a minimum coal stock of one month, but now it has come down to one day,"" mr jain said. ""our request to the centre is that railway wagons should be arranged and coal should be transported to the plants soonest. all the plants are already running in only 55 per cent capacity,"" the minister in chief minister arvind kejriwal's aam aadmi party (aap) government said. the centre today said it will ensure gas supply to power plants in delhi amid concerns over coal shortage. mr jain alleged the coal crisis appears to be ""man-made, just as the crisis of medical oxygen supply during the covid second wave."" ""there is politics going on. if you create a crisis, it will seem that some great work has been done by solving it,"" the delhi minister said. delhi has a 1,300 megawatt (mw) gas-fired power plant in bawana on the city's outskirts. ""all three companies in delhi are distributors and not power producers. we depend on the centre's plants. if the supply does not come, then after two days there will be a blackout in the whole of delhi,"" mr jain said. a reuters analysis of daily load despatch data from the central grid regulator showed india's power supply deficit in the first seven days of october amounted to 11.2 per cent of the country's total shortages throughout the year.   the data is publicly available but the analysis provides a first concrete indication of the extent of the problem. energy supplies are under strain globally as prices surge and demand and supply chains are strained by the recovery of consumption following lockdowns to contain the pandemic. mr kejriwal today tweeted he has written to modi modi for his intervention in making adequate arrangements of coal and gas to power plants supplying electricity to the city. ""delhi could face a power crisis. i am personally keeping a close watch over the situation. we are trying our best to avoid it. in the meanwhile, i wrote a letter to hon'ble pm seeking his personal intervention,"" mr kejriwal tweeted."

""the nfsa quota ration is for distribution through fair price shops and it's a countrywide policy. before making a long statement, aap leader saurabh bharadwaj should know that even the delhi high court had said that the government can start the doorstep ration scheme but it should never stop ration distribution through fair price shops,"" he said. the kejriwal government has been at loggerheads with the l-g and the centre over the implementation of its ambitious scheme, which was initially named ''mukhyamantri ghar-ghar ration yojana'', for a long time. the delhi government had made all preparations to roll out the scheme on march 25 but could not do so after the union ministry of consumer affairs said that foodgrains allotted by the centre for distribution under the nfsa cannot be used for running a state-specific or any other scheme by any name.   considering the objection, the delhi government dropped the word ''mukhyamantri'' from the scheme's name and decided to implement it under the existing nfsa act, 2013. however, the file of the scheme sent to the lg failed to get his approval."

""we were both suspended two months ago,"" cosimo, one of the protesters, told afp. he and his wife morena are both nurses. the couple say they have immunity and allergy problems and were exempted from the vaccination requirement by their family doctor. but both were suspended without pay. stefano, who came from como in the north to join saturday's protest, said he would take the test.

""we need stability,"" the 35-year-old conservative said, adding it would be ""irresponsible"" to allow austria to ""slide into months of chaos or gridlock"" while the eu member of almost nine million fights the pandemic. pressure on kurz to resign, including from his own junior coalition partner the greens, started after prosecutors on wednesday raided several locations linked to his people's party (oevp). they announced that kurz and nine other individuals were under investigation over claims that government money was used between 2016 and 2018 in a corrupt deal to ensure positive media coverage. kurz has denied any wrongdoing, reiterating on saturday that allegations against him were ""false."" ""i will be able to clarify it; i'm sure about that,"" he said calmly. - 'important step' kurz said he would suggest foreign minister alexander schallenberg as new chancellor, while he would stay on as oevp leader and a lawmaker in parliament. vice chancellor and greens leader werner kogler said he would meet schallenberg sunday to discuss how the coalition would continue to govern, calling kurz's resignation a ""right and important step"". kogler on friday had asked the oevp to name another chancellor, saying kurz was ""no longer fit for office"". but opposition parties criticised the greens for continuing to work with the oevp despite the corruption allegations. social democrats (spoe) leader pamela rendi-wagner said kurz would continue to pull the strings ""from the shadows"". by stepping down, kurz avoids having to face a parliamentary no-confidence motion, which he was expected to lose after the greens turned against him. in 2019, his coalition with the far-right freedom party (fpoe) collapsed after his ally became engulfed in a corruption scandal dubbed ""ibizagate"". but fresh elections once again saw kurz's oevp come out on top. 'human with emotions and mistakes' in the latest scandal, according to prosecutors, the core allegation is that between 2016 and 2018, finance ministry resources were used to finance ""partially manipulated opinion polls that served an exclusively party political interest"". this correlates to the time period in which kurz, already a government minister, took over the leadership of the oevp and later that of the alpine nation at the helm of a coalition with the fpoe. prosecutors allege that payments were made to an unnamed media company -- widely understood to be the oesterreich tabloid -- in return for publishing these surveys. while kurz has denied any wrongdoing, he said some of the text messages he wrote that have been leaked from the investigation files were composed in ""the heat of the moment"". ""i'm just human with emotions and mistakes,"" he said. the oevp-green coalition -- a first at a national level -- entered office in january 2020 and has already been put under strain several times by the fallout from other corruption scandals and differences over questions such as refugee policy.   thousands demonstrated in front of the oevp headquarters in central vienna late on thursday, calling for kurz's resignation while waving signs that read ""against corruption"" and ""shame on you"".

""let us concede that we need to allow other voices to come forward, but what are these voices saying? if the voices are saying muslims were bad 500 years ago and therefore, today's muslims have to suffer for it, and we will do this and we will do that and we will change this and we will change that, then i have a problem,"" the former union minister said in a session, titled ""bulls in our memory shop: debating heritage, history, hubris"". ""i would say what are you doing to today's india? why can't we focus on making a better india for all...instead of fighting these old battles? history for today's political misuse is what i have a problem with,"" he added. to buttress his point, mr tharoor gave the example of the present government declaring august 14 as ""partition horrors remembrance day"", which he stated was a ""very clear demonisation of one community"". ""this seemed to me targeting specifically healed wounds and scratching them,"" he said. modi modi this year declared august 14 as partition horrors remembrance day in the memory of the struggles and sacrifices of millions of people who were displaced and who lost their lives due to the mindless hate and violence caused by the country's partition. again, though in favour of memorialising what happened during the partition, mr tharoor claimed that there are people who want to revive the memories of what people have forgotten, and instead of forgiving, want to ""punish the supposed descendant of those who perpetrated those wrongs"". ""i have talked about memorialising the atrocities of colonialism, not because today, i want us to go and revolt against the british. that is over. that is history... but we should understand, as i have said talking about my book here, we must definitely forgive but we must not forget,"" said the best-selling author of several books, including ""an era of darkness: the british empire in india"" and ""pax indica"". ""now the problem is, here we have people who are not only prepared not to forget, who even want to revive memories real or imagined of what people have forgotten and then, instead of forgiving, want to punish the supposed descendants of those who perpetrated those wrongs. you cannot correct the wrongs of yesterday by creating new wrongs for tomorrow,"" he added. according to the 65-year-old congress mp from thiruvananthapuram, this is happening in the country today as a ""different ethos"" is in power, which states that india is fundamentally a ""hindu country"" and everyone else is ""a guest or an interloper"". ""and that the institutions of the state, the laws of the state and the practices of the state must reflect an allegiance to a certain cultural, civilisational understanding of india, which has nothing to do with the idea of india enshrined in the constitution, and that i think is a fundamental faultline,"" he said. mr tharoor was interjected by his fellow panellist in the discussion, historian vikram sampath, who said the wounds have not been healed so far, adding that there is a ""false assumption today that talking about the truth would upset contemporary social issues"". ""history worldwide offers the spaces to heal, to relive the past, get over it, make peace with it and move on. i think we have not done that. that is one reason these battles keep on happening, what we saw in ayodhya, what we keep seeing all the time. these are manifestations of that,"" mr sampath, who wrote two volumes on the life and works of hindutva ideologue veer savarkar, said.   he also accused the congress of unwittingly giving away the space of historiography to ""marxist historians"" post independence.

""the bsp, if voted to power, will not stop the developmental work of the current bjp government, which followed the footsteps of the bsp, in ayodhya, varanasi, mathura and other religious places,"" said mayawati.

""despite trumpeting about making a dalit the punjab chief minister and dramatics to woo the sikhs, people of that community cannot forget the pain of the anti-sikh riots under its rule,"" she said. she also lashed at the aam aadmi party accusing its government in delhi of doing little in facilitating the movement of up-bound migrant workers to their native state during the covid lockdown. she also dismissed the aap's promise of providing free power and water in up and punjab as ""promises made in air"". addressing the function at kanshi ram smarak sthal, the bsp chief also demanded a bharat ratna the bsp founder. insinuating that media houses take up pre-poll surveys only to influence popular mandate, mayawati said she would soon write to the election commission of india to ban pre-poll surveys by media for at least six months before the elections. mayawati's remarks came a day after a news channel survey showed that the bjp is poised to win most of the up assembly seats in 2022 and retain power. she also alleged that the bjp centre and up governments were misusing the state machinery to make the atmosphere in their favour for the elections in the most populous state. ""it is known to everyone that when these tactics do not work, the bjp will eventually give the election a hindu-muslim colour and try to take full political advantage in its garb. elections have to be fought keeping this in mind,"" she said. taking on the aap for its pre-poll promises of providing free water and power etc in up, mayawati said, ""the bjp sp and congress along with the aap, shiv sena and party of (asaduddin) owaisi are making various types of promises to the people of the state to get votes.""

""it's unbelievable that you can build a factory like this without permission,"" said 69-year-old local activist gurdrun luebeck. mr musk, expected to appear later at the ""giga-fest"", tweeted simply ""giga berlin-brandenburg fun party today"" in german on saturday morning. the company has laid on a big wheel, electronic music and vegetarian food trucks -- an event conceived in the image of berlin, europe's party capital. thousands are expected to attend, with locals given priority for the guest list announced by tesla earlier this week. environmental concerns tesla began construction at the site in gruenheide in 2019 after receiving preliminary approval under a special procedure. but local authorities are still in the process of evaluating the environmental impact of the factory, despite construction being all but done. the special treatment afforded to the company angered some residents, who are concerned about the impact the plant could have on the water supply and biodiversity. supported by ngos, opponents have sent letters, held protests and gone to court to try and stop the project. ""tesla has to follow the same procedures as other companies,"" the green league campaign group said recently. last year, work at the tesla site was temporarily stopped after ngos requested an injunction to protect the nearby natural habitat of endangered species of lizards and snakes while they were in their winter slumber. a residents' consultation, part of the approval process, is due to close on october 14. until the survey is completed, final approval cannot be given and production at the factory will not be allowed to begin. even then, the state environment ministry in brandenburg, where the plant is located, told afp ""no date has been fixed"" for this authorisation. despite local resistance, construction has been completed in double-quick time, replacing a swathe of pine forest with an enormous concrete-paved expanse accessed via ""tesla road"". economies of scale about 500,000 cars a year should roll off the line at the factory just outside berlin, tesla's first production location in europe. not all the attendees at saturday's party were convinced the region can take it. ""i'm sort of critical. there's not enough roads, not enough space for a factory like this here,"" said 35-year-old marlen winkler. on the same 300-hectare plot, mr musk also plans to build ""the world's biggest battery factory"". and the site will equally boast the ""world's largest die-casting machine"", said ferdinand dudenhoeffer, director of the center for automotive research in germany. the custom-built equipment should allow tesla to ""significantly reduce production costs"", mr dudenhoeffer said. in the event that the factory is not approved, the carmaker will be compelled to dismantle the entire works at its own cost. such a turn of events is, however, ""unlikely"", said mr dudenhoeffer, since the project has considerable ""political support"". ""every political party is in favour,"" the car expert explained, while noting that changes to the factory facade could be requested by authorities, delaying the beginning of production further. first planned for july 2021, the start has already been pushed back to the end of this year as a result of the company's administrative troubles. tesla was ""irritated"" by these setbacks, as it wrote in an open letter in march, in which the company called for a ""reform"" of germany's planning procedures. despite the country's reputation for efficiency, major infrastructure projects are often slowed down by excess bureaucracy.   berlin's new international airport opened in october 2020, eight years later than first planned, while the construction of a new train station in stuttgart is not yet finished, having begun in 2010.

""i feel very cheerful about coming to kabul and being able to visit qargha for the first time ... the people welcomed me and my companions in a brotherly manner,"" halimi, 24, a fighter from the central maidan wardak province, told reuters, asking not to give his full name. the fighters, who were all heavily armed at the park, sipped tea and bought snacks from stalls dotted along the shoreline. some queued up to try the amusement park rides, which included a pirate ship and a flying chairs carousel. behind halimi, ziaul haq, 25, also from maidan wardak, beamed as he went for a horse ride. most of the fighters had never been to kabul until the taliban took control of the capital on augsut 15, and some were eager to visit the amusement park before returning to their duties around the country. ""we're proud to have fought and now they (the americans) are gone, that's the most joyful thing we've experienced yet,"" halimi said, adding that he had met a cousin at the park and had a picnic to celebrate the taliban's comeback. the taliban waged a 20-year war against a western-backed government before returning to power in august after president ashraf ghani fled afghanistan. the fighters are now tasked with ensuring nationwide security, which has become increasingly fragile following at least three attacks on religious institutions in the last week. a suicide bombing on friday at a mosque in northwestern afghanistan killed at least 46 people and injured more than 140.   the attack was claimed by the isis in khorasan, a name taken from the ancient name for the region that includes modern afghanistan.

""if coal supply doesn't improve, there will be a blackout in delhi in two days,"" the national capital's power minister satyendra jain said today. ""the coal-fired power plants that supply electricity to delhi have to keep a minimum coal stock of one month, but now it has come down to one day,"" mr jain said. ""our request to the centre is that railway wagons should be arranged and coal should be transported to the plants soonest. all the plants are already running in only 55 per cent capacity,"" the minister in chief minister arvind kejriwal's aam aadmi party (aap) government said. the centre today said it will ensure gas supply to power plants in delhi amid concerns over coal shortage. mr jain alleged the coal crisis appears to be ""man-made, just as the crisis of medical oxygen supply during the covid second wave."" ""there is politics going on. if you create a crisis, it will seem that some great work has been done by solving it,"" the delhi minister said. delhi has a 1,300 megawatt (mw) gas-fired power plant in bawana on the city's outskirts. ""all three companies in delhi are distributors and not power producers. we depend on the centre's plants. if the supply does not come, then after two days there will be a blackout in the whole of delhi,"" mr jain said. a reuters analysis of daily load despatch data from the central grid regulator showed india's power supply deficit in the first seven days of october amounted to 11.2 per cent of the country's total shortages throughout the year.   the data is publicly available but the analysis provides a first concrete indication of the extent of the problem. energy supplies are under strain globally as prices surge and demand and supply chains are strained by the recovery of consumption following lockdowns to contain the pandemic. mr kejriwal today tweeted he has written to modi modi for his intervention in making adequate arrangements of coal and gas to power plants supplying electricity to the city. ""delhi could face a power crisis. i am personally keeping a close watch over the situation. we are trying our best to avoid it. in the meanwhile, i wrote a letter to hon'ble pm seeking his personal intervention,"" mr kejriwal tweeted."

""we are prepared for any such eventuality. we have a very strong counter-infiltration grid to stop them at the border. we have a very strong counter-terrorism grid in the hinterland to take care of any such actions. just as we dealt with them in the early 2000s, we will deal with them now also should they venture anywhere near us,"" he said. there have been increasing concerns in the indian security establishment over the possibility of terror spillover from afghanistan into jammu and kashmir through pakistan and rise in terrorist activities, particularly by groups such as lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed following the taliban wresting power in kabul. on the targeted killings in jammu and kashmir, the army chief said this is a matter of ""concern"" and described it as ""reprehensible"". ""they do not want normalcy. it is a last-ditch attempt to stay relevant,"" he said referring to terrorist groups. ""the people will revolt. if they (terrorists) say that they are doing all these for the people, then why you are killing your own people who are your support base. it is just an attempt to spread terror which is totally unacceptable,"" gen naravane said. about the ceasefire agreement between india and pakistan, gen naravane said it was observed in ""totality"" for four months from february. ""but from the end of july onwards to september and now the beginning of october, the sporadic incidents have again started. i think again, it is following the pattern of 2003 when it would start with one odd incident and rising to as good as not having a ceasefire,"" he said. ""over the last month or so, we are again seeing renewed attempts at infiltration. we have eliminated two or three such infiltration attempts,"" he added. in a sudden and significant move aimed at reducing tensions, the indian and pakistani armies on february 25 announced that they would cease firing across the loc while recommitting themselves to a 2003 ceasefire agreement.   ""apart from the infiltration bids, there have been three incidents of proper ceasefire violations that is one post firing at the other post,"" he said.

""there were all kinds of people"". the scale of the accident was not clear until it was reported by media late on friday, and confirmed on saturday by provincial authorities. magbado said the mongala authorities had informed kinshasa of the sinking just after it occurred, but had waited for more information about the number of casualties. search and rescue operations are continuing, but hopes are fading of finding more survivors, he said, adding that rescue efforts were hamstrung by the limited resources available to the authorities. ""we are struggling to make do with what we have,"" he said, adding that hopes of finding survivors were ""fading with every passing day"". provincial authorities have declared three days of mourning from monday.   the vast country in central africa, covering an area of 2.3 million square kilometres (900 million square miles), has very few passable roads and trips are often made on the congo river and its tributaries as well as on the eastern lakes, kivu and tanganyika in particular.

""our security requirements, environmental health and economic development are ensured by keeping india's maritime zones safe, secure and pollution-free. i am really happy to say that the icg is addressing all these challenges successfully,"" he noted. india is very quickly moving on the path of development and unhindered maritime access is one of its primary requirements, he said. ""our prosperity is largely linked to our seas since we are an arriving maritime power. that is why security and development of not just ourselves but of countries in the entire region is our primary aim,"" mr singh mentioned. according to the vision of the indian government, the icg has been at the forefront in promoting regional cooperation, maintaining peace in the indian ocean region, and working with international maritime agencies, he stated. ""i am really happy to say that the icg's gallant acts to ensure the maritime security has not only affected our region but our neighbourhood too. each of your successful missions show your efficiency and your effective response,"" mr singh added. whether it is the accident involving very large crude carrier new diamond or container ship x-press pearl, the icg has made a major contribution by firefighting and pollution control response by running operation sagar aaraksha 1 and 2, he said. ""had you (icg) not taken timely action, it would caused massive destruction in the indian ocean region,"" he said.   ""the country has received international recognition after the icg conducted these brave operations. moreover, the country's position as responsible and capable maritime power has also been strengthened because of it,"" he added. in september last year, the icg had sent its ships and aircraft to conduct firefighting mission and search and rescue mission at new diamond, which had caught fire around 37 nautical miles off the south-eastern sri lankan coast."

""the president absolutely wants to address the delays in the green card processing system as well,"" white house press secretary jen psaki told reporters at her daily news conference on friday. she was responding to a question on the wastage of some 80,000 unused employment-based green card numbers, which is officially lled legal permanent residency on october 1, as the us citizenship and immigration services (uscis) is unable to allocate them to several million people waiting in line for a green card. the inordinate delay in the green card process of hundreds and thousands of talented indian technology professionals, at times running into several decades, is one of the major issues of concern among the indian-americans and their dependent children living here. the h-1b visa, the most sought after among indian it professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows us companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like india and china. indian technology professionals had urged the biden administration and the us congress to make necessary legislative changes to not let those green card slots expire. earlier this week, congress mariannette miller-meeks introduced the preserving employment visas act that would allow the uscis to preserve unused employment-based visas for use in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. the legislation is the house companion to s. 2828, introduced by senator thom tillis in september. ""ensuring that our immigration system is fair and orderly is one of my top priorities in congress these visas are already authorised by congress and would have been used if not for the covid pandemic,"" said miller-meeks. ""my legislation would fuel the american recovery from covid contribute to long-term economic growth, and provide relief for healthcare providers by reducing the green card backlog,"" she said. in fiscal 2020; a total of 122,000 family-preference visas went unused. this caused the number of employment-based visas available in fy21 to rise to 226,000. this dramatic increase in employment-based visas represents a unique opportunity to reduce the green card backlog and improve american competitiveness through legal immigration. processing delays at the uscis could put these much-needed employment-based visas to waste. according to recent court filings, uscis is currently at risk of wasting almost 83,000 employment-based visas, which expired on october 1 this year. this is in addition to 9,100 unused employment-based visas from fy20.   wasting these visas would be a major loss to american economic competitiveness and to the healthcare industry. american businesses and healthcare providers were already struggling to fill both skilled and unskilled jobs before covid and continue to face labour shortages during recovery from the pandemic, said the congress (except for the headline, this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

""i can assure you that the candy desk is now, and will continue to be, well stocked,"" the current incumbent, pennsylvania's pat toomey, told afp. you'll have to take the republican senator's word for it, as pictures of the mahogany bureau, with its writing box, bookshelves and ventilation grills, are extremely rare thanks to a senate rule proscribing photography. senators enjoy oratory -- especially their own -- and keep unconventional hours. a vote on even the most ostensibly straightforward issue can take all night. the idea of the candy desk isn't really to keep the legislators well-nourished during these never-ending debates. but with almost a third of senators well into their 70s and beyond, the august body needs all the ambrosia it can get to keep the members perky in the small hours. tradition during donald trump's first impeachment trial in 2020, an important procedural priority was the transfer of large boxes of candy through the corridors of power to toomey's workstation. the senator has been the candy desk's gatekeeper-in-chief since 2015, and it is clear he considers trust bestowed in him to oversee this most sacred of duties a personal honor. ""but it is also just the natural order of things that the senator from pennsylvania would have the candy desk, since we lead america, and the world, in candy-making,"" he enthuses. toomey makes a strong case: some 200 candy-makers including the world-renowned hershey's operate in the keystone state, in a sector employing some 10,000 workers. senators are generally not allowed to accept gifts but there are exceptions, such as for low-value products that are sent from their home states to be handed out free-of-charge. the tradition began in 1968, when california republican george murphy, an accomplished actor and dancer with an eye for a crowd-pleasing gesture, was allocated the desk. known for his sweet tooth, he would invite colleagues to share the treats he had stashed to get through the long hours of speechmaking. the ritual was kept alive by subsequent custodians, including republican presidential candidates john mccain of arizona and rick santorum, who sat there during bill clinton's impeachment trial. ""keeping senators awake"" ""it's actually a very important part of keeping senators awake during these long hours of testimony,"" santorum, another pennsylvanian, told public radio station npr last year. santorum regales colleagues with a lesser-known controversy from clinton's 1999 acquittal for lying under oath during the monica lewinsky scandal -- when the 42nd president's legal team complained that they were being denied their rightful access to the candy. to the wider public it may not have been the most consequential point of order, but santorum was keenly aware of the injustice, and made a point of ensuring confectionary equity in even this most adversarial of scenarios. to argue that the candy desk is some totem of bipartisan comity might be to sugar-coat the issue, however. in washington, even over-indulging on candy can be a party political issue, and the democrats have thrown down the gauntlet with their own operation to rival toomey's. ""my desk is now the candy desk. yes, he's on the republican side. i'm on the democratic side,"" asserts cory booker, who generously doled out m&ms, the brightly colored morsels of americana made in his home state of new jersey, during donald trump's impeachment trials. booker, though, says he's open to contributing some of his bounty to toomey's trove of delights.   ""small acts of kindness make the world go round,"" he says with a grin. (except for the headline, this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

""establishing, for the first time in history, a strong global minimum tax will finally even the playing field for american workers and taxpayers, along with the rest of the world,"" joe biden said in a statement. the deal aims to stop large firms booking profits in low-tax countries such as ireland regardless of where their clients are, an issue that has become ever more pressing with the growth of ""big tech"" giants that can easily do business across borders. out of the 140 countries involved, 136 supported the deal, with kenya, nigeria, pakistan and sri lanka abstaining for now. the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd), which has been leading the talks, said that the deal would cover 90 per cent of the global economy. ""we have taken another important step towards more tax justice,"" german finance minister olaf scholz said in a statement emailed to reuters.""we now have a clear path to a fairer tax system, where large global players pay their fair share wherever they do business,"" his british counterpart rishi sunak said.but with the ink barely dry, some countries were already raising concerns about implementing the deal. the swiss finance ministry demanded in a statement that the interests of small economies be taken into account and said that the 2023 implementation date was impossible, while poland, which has concerns over the impact on foreign investors, said it would keep working on the deal. ""increased prosperity"" central to the agreement is a minimum corporate tax rate of 15% and allowing governments to tax a greater share of foreign multinationals' profits. us treasury secretary janet yellen hailed it as a victory for american families as well as international business. ""we've turned tireless negotiations into decades of increased prosperity - for both america and the world. today's agreement represents a once-in-a-generation accomplishment for economic diplomacy,"" yellen said in a statement. the oecd said that the minimum rate would see countries collect around $150 billion in new revenues annually while taxing rights on more than $125 billion of profit would be shifted to countries where big multinationals earn their income. ireland, estonia and hungary, all low tax countries, dropped their objections this week as a compromise emerged on a deduction from the minimum rate for multinationals with real physical business activities abroad. ""no teeth"" but some developing countries seeking a higher minimum tax rate say their interests have been sidelined to accommodate the interests of richer countries like ireland, which had refused to sign a deal with a minimum tax rate higher than 15 per cent. argentine economy minister martin guzman said on thursday that the proposals forced developing countries to choose between ""something bad and something worse"". while kenya, nigeria and sri lanka did not back a previous version of the deal, pakistan's abstention came as a surprise, one official briefed on the talks said. india also had qualms up to the last minute, but ultimately backed the deal, they added. there was also dissatisfaction among some campaign groups such as oxfam which said that the deal would not end tax havens. ""the tax devil is in the details, including a complex web of exemptions,"" oxfam tax policy lead susana ruiz said. ""at the last minute a colossal 10-year grace period was slapped onto the global corporate tax of 15 percent, and additional loopholes leave it with practically no teeth,"" ruiz added in a statement. companies with real assets and payrolls in a country can ensure some of their income avoids the new minimum tax rate. the level of the exemption tapers over a 10-year period. the oecd said that the deal would next go to the group of 20 economic powers to formally endorse at a finance ministers' meeting in washington on october 13 and then on to a g20 leaders summit at the end of the month in rome for final approval. there remains some question about the us position, which depends in part on domestic tax reform negotiations in congress   countries that back the deal are supposed to bring it onto their law books next year so that it can take effect from 2023, which many officials have said is extremely tight. french finance minister bruno le maire said paris would use its european union presidency during the first half of 2022 to translate the agreement into law across the 27-nation bloc.

""our findings highlight an urgent need to strengthen mental health systems in order to address the growing burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders worldwide,"" said lead study author damian santomauro, from the university of queensland's school of public health.

""the leaders reinforced their commitment to deepening joint cooperation and interoperability between the us and indian militaries to work more seamlessly together, including strengthening cooperation in new defence domains, such as space and cyber,"" semelroth added. the 2+2 dialogue between india and the us would be held in november this year, foreign secretary harsh vardhan shringla had said last month. the last meeting of the 2+2 was held in new delhi and the next meeting is to be hosted by the us. the dialogue takes place between foreign and defence ministers of both sides. on september 24, us president joe biden hosted the first-ever in-person summit of quad leaders that vowed to strive for an indo-pacific region that is free, open, inclusive, anchored by democratic values and unconstrained by coercion, sending an apparent message to china. china claims sovereignty over all of the south china sea. vietnam, malaysia, the philippines, brunei and taiwan have counter claims. china is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the south china sea and the east china sea. beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade. at president biden's invitation, modi modi and his counterparts scott morrison from australia and yoshihide suga from japan attended the first in-person quad summit during which they announced a slew of new initiatives to take on common challenges, amidst muscle flexing by an assertive china in the strategic region. in 2016, the united states designated india as a major defence partner. commensurate with this designation, in 2018, india was elevated to strategic trade authorisation tier 1 status, which allows india to receive license-free access to a wide range of military and dual-use technologies regulated by the department of commerce. us-india defense trade cooperation continues to expand with the logistics exchange memorandum of agreement, communications, compatibility and security agreement and the industrial security agreement now in place.   the bureau of political-military affairs supported the increase in total defense trade with india from near zero in 2008 to over usd 20 billion in 2020, according to the state department (except for the headline, this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

""this is about using the power of the government to silence 'trump' and our make america great again movement, the greatest such achievement of all time,"" he said.

""we will not allow any witness to defy a lawful subpoena or attempt to run out the clock, and we will swiftly consider advancing a criminal contempt of congress referral,"" thompson said. the committee has held one hearing so far, on july 27, when four capitol and washington police officers testified about defending the senate and house of representatives from the mob on january 6. trump has consistently refused to acknowledge his defeat to biden and make unfounded claims that he won the election.   the real estate mogul was impeached by the democratic-controlled house in january for inciting insurrection but was acquitted by the senate.

""this meeting is a continuation of the pragmatic engagements with the taliban that we've had ongoing on matters of vital national interest,"" said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""this meeting is not about granting recognition or conferring legitimacy. we remain clear that any legitimacy must be earned through the taliban's own actions. they need to establish a sustained track record,"" the official said. the united states' two decades-long occupation of afghanistan culminated in a hastily organized airlift in august which saw more than 124,000 civilians including americans, afghans and others being evacuated as the taliban took over. but thousands of other u.s.-allied afghans at risk of taliban persecution were left behind. washington and other western countries are grappling with difficult choices as a severe humanitarian crisis looms large over afghanistan. they are trying to formulate how to engage with the taliban without granting it the legitimacy it seeks while ensuring humanitarian aid flows into the country. many afghans have started selling their possessions to pay for ever-scarcer food. the departure of u.s.-led forces and many international donors robbed the country of grants that financed 75% of public spending, according to the world bank. while there was an improvement for humanitarian actors get access to some areas that they haven't been in a decade, problems still persisted, the u.s. official said, adding that the u.s. delegation would press taliban to improve. ""right now, we are facing some real access issues....there are a lot of challenges in ensuring that female aid workers are provided unimpeded access to all areas,"" the official said and added that washington needed to see an improvement by the taliban on this front ""if we are to contemplate even more robust humanitarian assistance."" pressure on women's rights while the taliban has promised to be more inclusive than when it led the country from 1996 to 2001, the united states has repeatedly said it will judge the new taliban government based on its deeds not its words. the taliban drew from its inner high echelons to fill top posts in afghanistan's new provisional government announced last month, including an associate of the islamist terrorist group's founder as premier and a wanted man on a u.s. terrorism list as interior minister. there were no outsiders and no women in the cabinet. the european union foreign policy chief said on sunday its behavior up to now was ""not very encouraging."" ""we will certainly press the taliban to respect the rights of all afghans including women and girls and to form an inclusive government with broad support,"" the u.s. official said. he added that there were discrepancies between the taliban's promises of continued safe passage and implementation. ""as a practical matter, their implementation of their commitments have been uneven. it is true that sometimes we receive assurances from certain levels but then follow through on those assurances has truly been uneven,"" the official said. the united states has directly facilitated the departure of 105 u.s. citizens and 95 lawful permanent residents out of afghanistan since aug. 31, when u.s. withdrawal was completed, state department spokesperson ned price said on thursday.   he declined to provide a precise figure for those remaining, but said the agency was in contact with ""dozens of americans in afghanistan who wish to leave"" but that the number was dynamic and constantly changing.

""the registration of a regular case can have disastrous consequences for the career of an officer, if the allegations ultimately turn out to be false. in a preliminary enquiry, the cbi is allowed access to documentary records and speak to persons just as they would in an investigation, which entails that information gathered can be used at the investigation stage as well."" it said. the bench added that conducting a pe would not take away from the ultimate goal of prosecuting accused persons in a timely manner and ""we once again clarify that if the cbi chooses not to hold a preliminary enquiry, the accused cannot demand it as a matter of right"". it said that earlier verdicts of the top court had clarified that a pe is valuable in corruption cases but it does not vest a right in the accused and only ensure that there is no abuse of the process of law in order to target public servants. it said that it has been thus held in earlier verdicts that a pe is not mandatory when the information received discloses the commission of a cognizable offence. ""even when it is conducted, the scope of a preliminary enquiry is not to ascertain the veracity of the information, but only whether it reveals the commission of a cognizable offence. the need for a preliminary enquiry will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. as an illustration, ''corruption cases'' fall in that category of cases where a preliminary enquiry ''may be made'',"" it said. the bench said that the cbi manual as held by this court earlier is not a statute enacted by the legislature and it is a compendium of administrative orders for the internal guidance of the cbi and the use of the expression ""may be made"" goes to emphasize that holding a preliminary enquiry is not mandatory. it said the precedents of this court and the provisions of the cbi manual make it abundantly clear that a pe is not mandatory in all cases which involve allegations of corruption. it added that similarly, the cbi manual notes that a pe is required only if the information (whether verified or unverified) does not disclose the commission of a cognizable offence. ""even when a preliminary enquiry is initiated, it has to stop as soon as the officer ascertains that enough material has been collected which discloses the commission of a cognizable offence,"" the bench said. the proposition that a pe is mandatory is plainly contrary to law, for it is not only contrary to the decision of the constitution bench but would also tear apart the framework created by the cbi manual, it added. the bench said the single judge of the telangana high court has acted completely beyond the settled parameters which govern the power to quash an fir. ""the single judge has donned the role of a chartered accountant. the single judge has completely ignored that the court was not at the stage of trial or considering an appeal against a verdict in a trial"", it said.   the cbi in its fir registered on september 20, 2017 has claimed that the couple has acquired assets worth over â‚¹ 5.55 crore against the income of over â‚¹ 4.84 crore during the check period of april 1, 2010 to february 29, 2016. it has said there was a 22.86 per cent jump in their income to the tune of assets worth â‚¹ 1,10,81,692."

This Year Too,"all eight winners of the 2021 nobel prizes in medicine, chemistry, physics and literature have been men, re-igniting a recurring debate about diversity in the highly coveted awards, particularly those in science. ardem patapoutian and david julius received the nobel for medicine on monday. giorgio parisi, syukuro manabe and klaus hasselmann won the physics gong for their work deciphering chaotic climate, while benjamin list and david macmillan received the chemistry accolade for developing a tool for molecule building. tanzanian novelist abdulrazak gurnah, 72, on wednesday became only the second writer of color in sub-suharan africa ever to win a nobel prize for literature. the last black recipient of the prize was toni morrison in 1993. ""abdulrazak gurnah meets at least one of the criterion of a writer from a non-traditional cultural circle - a non-european with a colonial background, but he's no woman,"" said anne-marie morhed, head of the swedish association of female academics. ""two prizes remain, the peace prize and the economy prize. the (norwegian) nobel committee... still have a chance to honor a woman."" exiled belarus opposition leader sviatlana tsikhanouskaya and greta thunberg are at least two women seen to be in contention when the nobel peace prize is awarded in norway on friday. the norwegian nobel committee is led by a woman and the majority of the members are women. ditto the previous committee: led by a woman and with a majority of women on it. there has also been a real push in recent years to not give the prize to only white men from north america and western europe, as was the case in the earlier decades. in comparison to the dozen black peace laureates in the nobel's history, there has never been a black recipient of the prizes for medicine, chemistry and physics, points out professor winston morgan, a toxicologist at the university of east london who has looked at representation in the prizes as part of his research on inequality in the sciences. ""in terms of the gap between the world's population and the winners - the biggest gap is a gender one,"" morgan said. ""the number of female prize winners is really, really tiny."" scientists of both genders have already taken to social media to decry the lack of women recognized so far this year. genderavenger, a non-profit group dedicated to advancing women's voices in public dialog, said the prizes were ""like a terrible mystery where you know the ending halfway through the book. 4 out of 6 categories announced and nary a woman in sight, @nobelprize. is the story of the 2021 nobel prize that the men did it? (spoiler: women are also doing amazing work).""   some, including ellie murray, an assistant professor of epidemiology at boston university school of public health, expressed disappointment that this year's awards excluded the contributions of katalin kariko and kizzmekia corbett, key scientists behind the development of mrna vaccines that are changing the course of the pandemic. nobel watchers, however, said it was entirely likely that kariko and corbett would be recognized in years to come. the committee, they said, tended to reward recipients after a period of time. ""the issue for the nobel prize is it has a criteria and a tradition and it is hard for them to break away from that,"" morgan said, adding that the committee would likely respond to scientific innovation during the pandemic in three or four years. he added that if you looked at the general trajectory of nobel prize winners, the number of women scientists was growing as were those given to men from japan and china. ""we are not seeing that same trajectory for black scientists. that concerns me more,"" he said. ""you need to ask are there enough black scientists in universities and are they being supported."" asked why there were so few black nobel prize winners for literature, gurnah told reuters the world was changing. jesper haeggstrom, chairman of the nobel assembly that awarded the prize in physiology or medicine, said there was no simple explanation for the lack of female prize winners, but that it reflected the representation of women in science. ""there has been an under-representation of women historically in science, so the further back in time you look, the fewer female candidates there are,"" he said. haeggstrom declined to say whether gender played a role in the committee's selection process. ""i'm not at liberty to give you any details on this, but in general terms, i can say that scientific competence is the deciding factor,"" he said. critics, however, point to the makeup of the scientific selection committees. only 25% of the 50 professors on the medicine selection committee are women.   the committee for physics at the royal swedish academy of sciences consists of six members, of which one is a woman, and two co-opted members, both men. the chemistry committee consists of six members, all male, and two co-opted members, both women.

""he has harassed and intimidated the mother both before her departure to england and since,"" said the judge, and ""is prepared to countenance those acting on his behalf doing so unlawfully in the u.k."" sheikh mohammed denied the allegations in a statement to bloomberg. the case concerns ""supposed operations of state security"" and ""it was not appropriate for me"" to provide evidence on such sensitive matters, he said. ""the findings are therefore inevitably based on an incomplete picture"" and are also based on evidence ""not provided to me or my minders,"" said the sheikh. ""i therefore maintain that they were made in a manner which was unfair."" lawyers for princess haya declined to comment. the rulings by one of britain's most senior judges add to the embarrassment facing the dubai royal family. mcfarlane ruled early last year that sheikh mohammed conducted a campaign aimed at ""intimidating and frightening"" his estranged wife. nso's software has been found on phones belonging to journalists and activists with human rights groups accusing the israeli firm of using the technology to eavesdrop on conversations and track messages. the firm says its product is sold to law enforcement and intelligence agencies of vetted governments only. an nso document previously published by security researchers describes pegasus as a tool that can ""remotely and covertly extract valuable intelligence from virtually any mobile device."" it can be installed on a phone by tricking a targeted person into clicking a link, according to the document, or by forcing a phone to download the spy tool without any user interaction, usually by exploiting security vulnerabilities on the device. sheikh mohammed had stated that it was hard to see how the hacking allegations made a ""substantial difference"" to the issue of his contact with his children, according to mcfarlane. the judge said in wednesday's ruling that he considered the matter to be of the ""utmost seriousness,"" saying it may have a profound impact on his ability to trust the sheikh with anything but the ""most minimal and secure arrangements"" for contact with his children.   in a separate judgment, the judge also said that agents acting for the sheikh had tried to buy a 30 million-pound ($40.7 million) estate next to the princess's own property west of london. the judge said the princess rightly feared that the sheikh could use the estate in an attempt to abduct the children by offering a transport hub for a helicopter. the police, he said, have been given copies of the court orders preventing abduction."

""this has life-changing potential in a world where the global environmental crisis causes more than nine million premature deaths every year,"" said david boyd, un special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, who called the decision a ""historic breakthrough"". the text, proposed by costa rica, the maldives, morocco, slovenia and switzerland, was passed with 43 votes in favour and four abstentions from russia, india, china and japan, prompting a rare burst of applause in the geneva forum. britain, which was among the critics of the proposal in recent intense negotiations, voted in favour in a surprise, last-minute move. its ambassador to the un in geneva, rita french, said the uk was voting 'yes' because it shared supporters' ambition to tackle climate change but added that states would not be bound to the resolution's terms. the united states did not vote since it is not currently a member of the 47-member council. costa rica's ambassador, catalina devandas aguilar, said the decision will ""send a powerful message to communities around the world struggling with climate hardship that they are not alone"". critics had raised various objections, saying the council was not the appropriate forum and citing legal concerns. environmental defenders had said britain's earlier critical stance was undermining its pledges ahead of the global climate conference it is hosting in glasgow next month. john knox, a former un special rapporteur, said ahead of the vote that those who had criticised the resolution were ""on the wrong side of history"". the world health organization estimates that some 13.7 million deaths a year, or around 24.3% of the global total, are due to environmental risks such as air pollution and chemical exposure.   another proposal led by the marshall islands to create a new special rapporteur on climate change was also approved by the council on friday.

""it has been less than two months since the taliban took afghanistan and it is quite obvious that things are far from settled even in kabul. i would urge some patience, some deliberations and some caution,"" he said. to a question on whether india is adopting a wait-and-watch approach on engagement with the taliban after indian envoy to qatar deepak mittal's meeting with taliban leader sher mohammad abbas stanekzai in doha in late august, mr jaishankar did not give a direct reply and generally replied that he would prefer to make due diligence on issues of policy-making. he said there could be things happening which he may not be able to speak about and that india's primary contact has been in doha. ""that's where it is,"" he said. on the overall situation, mr jaishankar said it is still unfolding and india is responding to the evolving situation as it is hard to take a ""very definitive position"" beyond that because of lack of clarity. ""there is still a lot of lack of clarity. obviously, some of the more visible changes are apparent. so you have to take your positions, make your decisions on the basis of what you have. now the general sense in the international community is that there are some basic expectations which the world has of afghanistan,"" mr jaishankar said. ""the most basic of them is actually the fact that afghan soil will not be used for terrorism against other countries. there are also expectations about the nature of the government that it will be inclusive in some form,"" he said. he also noted that there are questions over how the minorities, women and children are dealt with. ""these are all live issues and we are actually quite involved in shaping the thinking of the international community on that, partly because we also happen to be at this time a un security council member,"" mr jaishankar said. on thursday, speaking at a conclave of the dd news, jaishankar had said the afghan people know ""what india has done for them, what kind of friends we have been."" ""i am sure they're contrasted with what pakistan did for them in the same period. and i think the differences are obvious. and in terms of where our relationship with pakistan goes, everybody wants to be friends with their neighbours', but you want to be friends on terms which a civilized world will accept,"" he said. the external affairs minister said, ""terrorism is not one of those terms"".   ""so, you know, neighbours' are supposed to trade with you, neighbours' are supposed to give you connectivity, neighbours' are supposed to promote contacts, to increase travel,"" he said. ""now, all of that hasn't happened with this neighbour. so, i think they have an important choice whether to be a normal neighbour, to us, a lot of it the next 75 years would depend on the choice that they make,"" he added."

""i will return to power and form government again,"" mr gehlot had said, in a clear message that he holds the reins in rajasthan. mr pilot had so far not commented on the swipe, and even went campaigning with mr gehlot and congress leader ajay maken for a by-election to be held on october 30. a photo of the three leaders shared by the congress was seen by many as the party's attempt to present a united face in the state leadership. however, mr pilot seemed to have broken his silence. at a book release in jaipur on thursday, when a participant commended mr pilot for ""covering so many work in such a short span"", the congress leader replied, ""i am here for 50 years and i am not going anywhere. i will complete all the unfinished work."" mr gehlot has been under pressure for a while to go for a cabinet expansion to accommodate mr pilot's loyalists. so far the chief minister has resisted making the changes that his party leadership had promised to mr pilot, who was deputy chief minister till june last year when he was forced to resign.   mr gehlot - already a two-time chief minister by 2018 - was made the chief minister again after the congress won the assembly election that year. but it was not an easy decision for the party as mr pilot was also eyeing the top post. the younger congress leader is credited with rebuilding the party after its washout in the 2013 state election. last year, mr pilot supported by 18 congress mlas ended a month-long revolt against mr gehlot only after a meeting with the gandhis, who apparently assured him that their grievances would be heard."

maria ressa: i think it's just starting to, it has been an insane frantic period that's gone up and down first unbelievable. and then stunning. and then it makes you just go back. overall the last few years have been so difficult and now, hopefully, more energy for the future. ndtv: absolutely. and, maria, your fight has been something watched by so many journalists around the world and also being lived by so many journalists around the world today, as we speak, both of yours and of dmitry and so many others. it is wonderful what the nobel committee actually said that this represents really an ideal for all those journalists. what would you say? maria ressa: i think this is something that journalists were embattled like me, like dmitry, like many in india as well. right. women, in particular, have been attacked online in the philippines at least 10 times more. the way that news organisations have lost our gatekeeping powers to technology platforms which have made facts available has rippled through our society. so i think this is a recognition of the importance of facts in any shared reality to find solutions and facts. with journalists holding that line. this recognizes not only how difficult it has been to continue doing what we used to do, the job of holding power to account, but at the same time, i think will give us more energy to try to crafts the years ahead. ndtv: right. and, maria, just that point you made because we talk about even in india. and of course, at ndtv, we identify with some of that because you only see government agencies go after journalist organizations when you see funding methods being set off. when you see government agencies doing tax raids and you as well were convicted for libel, you faced a jail term, you actually went to jail, got out only on bail. there are so many different ways of attacking people. media houses, organizations speak truth to power. nowadays, it's almost impossible to keep up. maria ressa: well, the first thing that we're seeing is really how american social media platforms have been used. their weaknesses, the algorithms are used to attack the truth-tellers. and once you weaken the facts, then that creates an enabling environment where journalists trying to hold power to account are attacked and attacked in my case with the law. look, i had the philippine government file 10 arrest warrants against me in less than two years. i spent more time with lawyers than i did managing rappler. here's the thing. when i was convicted of cyber libel last year, i was convicted for a story in 2012 that i didn't write, edit or supervise at a time when the law i supposedly violated didn't even really exist. this is a time where power is consolidating power, where the very platforms that deliver the news, the social media platforms have become behaviour modi systems that actually change the beliefs people have. so in many ways, journalists are on a quick stand. our credibility is under attack. trust is under attack. and the very same platforms where we're being attacked are the ones that are also siphoning away our business model, the advertising dollars. so it's an existential moment. and i think what the nobel committee did is to show that without facts, you can't have the truth. without truth, you can't have trust. if you don't have any of these things, you can't have a functioning democracy, much less try to solve the complex problems we're dealing with today in the world, like the covid then this information problem, the anti-vax issues, the conspiracy theories that come through or climate change. this is a problem that's global in scope. ndtv: in fact and without freedom of expression. i mean, it seems such a simple concept, but really, to award freedom of expression, the fight for it as a fight. there's a global battle for peace and for democracy, i think, is so important as well. and you, of course, maria, have taken on the president of the philippines, not him personally. what he's been saying, the drugs scandals, issues of corruption, issues of misogyny. sometimes when you take on the president of a state, especially one who's often authoritarian or very popular with almost cult-like figures, it's seen as anti-national. that's the word very popularly used in india. it's seen as anti-national. it's seen as that you're against the country rather than against a government. how have we come to this stage where you made the point that you know, perhaps at one point, journalists as truth-tellers as holding power to account now are themselves under scrutiny as being enemies of the state are anti-national. maria ressa: i think this is a part of the way we are being attacked, to make our work, to hold power, to account inconsequential. right. and that's tearing down, shooting the messenger, if you will. the problem, of course, is it's also a form of gaslighting in the sense that we come under attack because we're trying to do our jobs calling us anti-national. president duterte, for example, in the state of the nation address, said that rapper was owned by americans. that's not true. and yet when it comes out of the president's mouth, you expect it to have to be true. this is another problem, right? and again, that connects back to our information ecosystem. when you make facts debatable and instead of being held accountable, power then can just lie we're in a different world. and that's, i think, part of what the choices of the nobel committee showed is that journalists like us will continue to try to hold the line, to try to hold power, tremendous power to account. then it has become even more difficult to do that. and with dmitry, i hope we stand for all of the journalists around the world who are doing our very best to keep power in check. ndtv: absolutely. and i think it's something really doing our best. i mean, journalists are trying their best, extremely challenging circumstances. your win and dmitry's win have given all of us at any tv and many of our counterparts much, much hope. but just tell me, maria, did you ever think, especially in the last five or six years, when you decided to set up your own investigative journalism website? and when you face death threats and at that point, you made about women journalists? because i do think the kind of abuse we face is something which is specifically targeted and very, very different to what male journalists often face. did you ever think it's time you should do something else?   maria ressa: no. and this is the crazy thing. rappel came under government attack when i'm old. this is my 35th year as a journalist. and so when we came under attack, my co-founders and i, we already knew why we were doing what we were doing. and we understood the mission of journalism. so in the beginning, it was kind of like it was in disbelief that the government would try to do these things, try to file cases against us, try to call us foreign influences. and yet, as we move forward, you have no choice but to continue to challenge these things. and you realize that the mission of journalism is more important today than ever. and as in january 20, when the government tried to shut us down by taking away our licence to operate, we challenged it in court. we continued to operate. and it actually gave our small company or about 100 journalists, 63 per cent young women, 23 years oldest, a median age. so i gave our small company a real mission, it made it come alive. you don't know who you are until you're really forced to fight for it. and in that sense, in some ways, i can almost say we know who we are. we'll continue to hold the line. and now, as we move towards presidential elections in may 2022, it signals the end of six years term of president duterte. i think we're at this moment where we must make sure that we keep democracy alive, that we shore up our failing institutions because, in the end, we do get the democracy we deserve. ndtv: well, maria is an inspiration to all of us at ndtv and journalists around the world. the nobel going to two very, very brave journalists, maria ressa and dmitry muratov. thank you so much for joining me on tv tonight. thank you."

""in ap, the covid power demand increased by 15 per cent in the last six months and by 20 per cent in the last one month. the power sector is being pushed into turmoil because of coal shortage. it has become increasingly difficult for us to meet the grid demand and the circumstances are pushing us towards load shedding,"" the chief minister pointed out. the state has been currently meeting a demand of about 185-190 million units of power daily. the chief minister said thermal power generating stations of ap genco, which meet 45 per cent of the state's energy needs, hardly have coal stocks for one or two days. the genco plants were operating at less than 50 per cent of their 90 million units per day capacity. ""the central generating stations have also not been able to supply more than 75 per cent of their 40 mu per day capacity. the state has not been executing contracts with coal-based plant to absorb energy from renewable sources (8,000 mw) and, as such, is heavily dependent on market purchases to bridge the shortfall,"" mr reddy said. the daily average market price of power in the open market increased from â‚¹ 4.6 per kwh on september 15 to â‚¹ 15 per kwh on october 8. ""the rates in day-ahead and real-time power markets are soaring by the day and have reached a peak of â‚¹ 20 per unit at most time. power is also not available at certain hours due to less generation in the country,"" the chief minister lamented. he apprehended that the situation was ""quite alarming"" and finances of power distribution companies would deteriorate further if the situation persisted. since it was harvesting season, more water was required for crops and denial (of power and water) would cause the fields to dry up.   ""unplanned power cuts once resorted to will lead to chaotic conditions in the society as witnessed in (the year) 2012. i therefore request your urgent personal attention to monitor the scenario to avert (such) chaotic conditions,"" the chief minister urged the modi the chief minister also requested that banks and lending institutions be instructed to provide working capital loans liberally to the power distribution companies to make coal payments and also undertake market purchases."

""under these circumstances, this court is inclined to take up the writ petition for the purpose of determining the rights of the parties. the high court is empowered to entertain the writ proceedings under article 226 of the constitution and the power conferred is also emphasised by the supreme court of india,"" the judge pointed out and directed the iffco-tokio general insurance company limited here to pay the compensation of â‚¹ 10 lakh to the remaining claimants under the third party insurance category.

""i'm scared. i have small children, my mother and wife. for them i have to leave,"" he said. vinod bhat, 39, returned to the valley 10 years ago after getting a job under the pm's special scheme. in all that time, he said he had never felt unsafe. now, after the attacks, around a third of the neighbourhood have left. ""thirty per cent must have left... they are leaving quietly. who will stay here in such an atmosphere?"" he asked. around 400 pandit families had been living in sheikhpora but, since yesterday, the area resembles a ghost town. the story is the same in other pandit settlements, where families have left for jammu. ""our entire family is going to jammu because of the worsening situation here. two-three pandits have been killed... we can't take the risk anymore,"" khushi said. over the last five days seven civilians have been killed in kashmir. one was a sikh school principal, supunder kour. today hundreds of sikhs joined her funeral procession and took out a protest march, shouting slogans against the trf (the resistance front, a terror outfit j&k police say is to blame for her killing) and demanding justice. sikh leaders will decide on what to do after meeting other gurdwara committees. ""it is not that we will leave kashmir... we feel like staying here (but) there is uncertainty. we all will sit and discuss,"" jagdish singh azad, a sikh leader, said. both sikhs and pandits have found support in local muslim communities, many of whom joined the mourners and urged them to stay. some of those targeted over the recent days were muslims. ""please don't leave. we will fight it together. we have been fighting this war together for last 30 years, and we have fight it again. my appeal is don't come under pressure or give in to propaganda,"" nasir sogami, a national conference leader, said. police have said that of the 28 civilians killed since january, seven are non-muslims. while muslims have usually been the targets of such attacks, the fact that a kashmiri pandit, a sikh and two non-local hindus have now been killed has led to outrage  the killings have also alarmed the authorities - enough for home minister amit shah to hold a high-level meet yesterday and reportedly pull up local officials.   sources say the police are clueless and have launched a massive crackdown to see if they can uncover something. dozens of youth have been rounded up for questioning, but that approach has its own problems. the biggest challenge now is to prevent further attacks and stop the exodus of pandits, who are leaving the valley out of fear."

""everything is torn"" from his head, he said, complaining that he was the only one in the dock. allegations against schuetz include aiding and abetting the ""execution by firing squad of soviet prisoners of war in 1942"" and the murder of prisoners ""using the poisonous gas zyklon b"". the sachsenhausen camp detained more than 200,000 people between 1936 and 1945, including jews, roma, regime opponents and gay people. tens of thousands of inmates died from forced labour, murder, medical experiments, hunger or disease before the camp was liberated by soviet troops, according to the sachsenhausen memorial and museum. 'no man like you' schuetz's defence had said at the opening of the case on thursday that he would not speak about his time at the camp, but would only provide details about his personal life. arriving alone at the hearing with his walking aid, schuetz recounted in detail his past, including his work at his family's farm in lithuania with his seven siblings before his enrolment in the army in 1938. after the war, he was transferred to a detainees camp in russia before he was sent to brandenburg state in germany where he worked as a farmer and later as a locksmith. speaking with a clear voice, he spoke about his past birthdays with his daughters and grandchildren, or about his late wife. ""my wife always said that 'there's no other man in the world like you',"" said the widower since 1986. schuetz remains free during the trial. even if convicted, he is highly unlikely to be put behind bars given his age. more than seven decades after world war ii, german prosecutors are racing to bring the last surviving nazi perpetrators to justice. the 2011 conviction of former guard john demjanjuk, on the basis that he served as part of hitler's killing machine, set a legal precedent and paved the way to several of these twilight justice cases. since then, courts have handed down several guilty verdicts on those grounds rather than for murders or atrocities directly linked to the individual accused. among those brought to late justice were oskar groening, an accountant at auschwitz, and reinhold hanning, a former ss guard at auschwitz. both were convicted at the age of 94 of complicity in mass murder, but died before they could be imprisoned. most recently, former ss guard bruno dey was found guilty at the age of 93 last year and was given a two-year suspended sentence. separately in the northern german town of itzehoe, a 96-year-old former secretary in a nazi death camp is on trial for complicity in murder.   she dramatically fled before the start of her trial, but was caught several hours later. her trial resumes on october 19.

""while alzheimer's is primarily characterised by harmful build-up of amyloid protein and tangles in the brain, there is also extensive inflammation in the brain that highlights the importance of the immune system in alzheimer's,"" said study lead author dervis salih from university college london (ucl) in the uk. ""we have found that some of the same immune system changes can occur in both alzheimer's disease and covid mr salih said. in patients with severe covid infection there can also be inflammatory changes in the brain, the researchers said. the newly identified gene can contribute to an exaggerated immune response to increase risks of both alzheimer's and covid they said. the oas1 gene is expressed in microglia, a type of immune cell that constitutes around 10 per cent of all cells found within the brain. the researchers sequenced genetic data from 2,547 people, half of whom had alzheimer's disease. they found that people with a particular variation, called rs1131454, of the oas1 gene were more likely to have alzheimer's, increasing carriers' risk of the disease by an estimated 11 to 22 per cent. their findings add oas1, an anti-viral gene, to a list of dozens of genes now known to affect a person's risk of developing alzheimer's disease. the researchers investigated four variants on the oas1 gene, all of which dampen its activity. they found that the variants increasing the risk of alzheimer's disease are inherited together with oas1 variants recently found to increase the risk of needing intensive care for covid by as much as 20 per cent. in immune cells treated to mimic the effects of covid the researchers found that the gene controls how much the body's immune cells release pro-inflammatory proteins. they found that microglia cells where the gene was expressed more weakly had an exaggerated response to tissue damage, unleashing what they call a 'cytokine storm', which leads to an autoimmune state where the body attacks itself. oas1 activity changes with age, so further research into the genetic network could help to understand why older people are more vulnerable to alzheimer's, covid and other related diseases, the researchers said.   ""our findings suggest that some people may have increased susceptibility to both alzheimer's disease and severe covid irrespective of their age, as some of our immune cells appear to engage a common molecular mechanism in both diseases,"" ucl phd student naciye magusali added.

""on an exciting october dawn in 1932, a puss moth and i soared joyfully from karachi with our first precious load of mail, on an inaugural flight to bombay,"" jrd tata later recalled.

Had They Allowed Me..."": Navjot Sidhu's Latest Googly","navjot sidhu's tantrums continue to embarrass the congress at a time the party high command is trying to focus on setting its house in order ahead of the 2022 punjab assembly election. the latest headache for the ruling party was on thursday after sidhu - who hasn't yet formally withdrawn his resignation as chief of the congress punjab unit - decided to lead party workers from mohali to up's lakhimpur kheri, to protest the brutal killing of farmers. in visuals of the contingent as they prepared to set out on their protest, sidhu, who today began a fast demanding the arrest of union minister ajay mishra's son, looked visibly upset because he had to wait for chief minister charanjit channi's arrival. the former cricketer - whose threat to quit last month left the congress scrambling, particularly since the party had backed him in his bitter and public feud with former chief minister amarinder singh - was then caught on camera criticising his party. the video in question shows sidhu's close aide and cabinet minister pargat singh trying to pacify him by saying mr channi would join them soon. sukhwinder singh danny, one of the punjab congress working president, then tells sidhu the march will be successful. the response appears bitter; he says: ""where is the success? if bhagwant sidhu's son (a reference to his father) was allowed to lead, then you would have seen... congress is in a dying stage..."" the remark has also been condemned by the opposition akali dal, which has said it showed sidhu's lack of respect for the dalit community. the akalis have also declared the comment had revealed the congress ""caste card"" - ahead of the election - had been exposed. ""persons who keep own ambition above people's welfare cannot give any direction to the state. they stand exposed... congress president sonia gandhi should tell punjabis why she tried to fool them by making a scheduled caste chief minister... but simultaneously reposes faith in sidhu,"" akali dal leader dr daljit singh cheema said. sidhu and amarinder singh have waged an increasingly public and hostile spat over the past few months, culminating in mr singh declaring himself ""humiliated"" and quitting. as he did so, amarinder singh repeatedly warned the congress not to trust mr sidhu and declared that he was committed to ensuring his rival did not ascend to his former post. the amarinder-sidhu spat dates back to the 2017 election, after which sidhu expected to be made deputy chief minister but that was reportedly blocked by amarinder singh. the congress high command appointed sidhu as state unit chief and charanjit channi as chief minister (punjab's first dalit sikh leader, and appointment made in light of the fact that dalits constitute nearly a third of the state's population) in the hopes it would quell in-fighting.   however, sidhu seems as unwilling to work with channi as he was with amarinder singh. his threat to quit as punjab congress chief was apparently triggered by the chief minister not consulting him over key appointments, including those for the chief of the state's police."

""on an emotional note, air india, under the leadership of mr jrd tata had, at one time, gained the reputation of being one of the most prestigious airlines in the world. tatas will have the opportunity of regaining the image and reputation it enjoyed in earlier years. mr jrd tata would have been overjoyed if he was in our midst today,"" mr tata said in the statement he tweeted alongside the old photo. air india, the airline that gave wings to a nation, was born of jrd tata's love for aviation. not only did jrd tata pioneer aviation in india, he was also the recipient of the first licence ever issued to an indian.  jrd tata was 24 when a flying club opened in his home town bombay. though he wasn't the first person to register, he did become the first indian to pass out with 'no. 1' endorsed on his flying licence, according to a blog post from tata group.  on october 15, 1932, jrd tata famously piloted the first flight in the history of indian aviation. the tata air services flight took off from karachi's drigh road aerodrome and flew to mumbai's juhu airstrip. the aircraft was a single-engined de havilland puss moth.  ""on an exciting october dawn in 1932, a puss moth and i soared joyfully from karachi with our first precious load of mail, on an inaugural flight to bombay,"" jrd tata later recalled. ""we were a small team in those days. we shared successes and failures, the joys and headaches, as together we built up the enterprise which later was to blossom into air-india and air-india international."" hearing ""air india"" today conjures up images of its iconic mascot: the portly maharaja.  this now familiar lovable figure first made his appearance in air india way back in 1946, when bobby kooka as air india's commercial director and umesh rao, an artist with j.walter thompson ltd., mumbai, together created the maharaja, according to the airline. jrd's 46-year aviation career spanned an era from the little two-seater puss moth to the 400-seater giant boeing 747. a perfectionist himself, mr tata demanded that there should be no compromise on operating and maintenance standards or on service. an executive with the airline recalled how the chairman once called him in the middle of the night to offer suggestions on how to improve the wording on a publicity hoarding. jrd tata once told the airline's employees, ""i want that the passengers who travel with us do not have occasion to complain. i want to establish that there is no airline which is better liked by passengers, that is safer and more punctual, where the food and services is better, and which sets a better image than air india.""   in fact, pandit jawaharlal nehru once wrote to mr tata to praise the high quality of the airline. ""i think that air india international has played not an unimportant part in raising the prestige of india abroad,"" the former modi said in his letter.  tata sons won a bid of â‚¹ 18,000 crore to regain control of the government airline nearly 70 years after its nationalisation."

""we assure our shiite brothers that in the future, we will provide security for them and that such problems will not happen to them,"" he said. residents of kunduz, the capital of a province of the same name, told afp the blast hit the mosque during friday prayers, the most important of the week for muslims. one witness, rahmatullah, said 300 to 400 worshippers were inside. frightened crowds graphic images shared on social media, and which could not immediately be verified, showed several bloodied bodies lying on the floor. pictures showed plumes of smoke rising into the air over kunduz. a female teacher in kunduz told afp the blast happened near her house, and several of her neighbours were killed.

""the buddhas were destroyed by the taliban authorities in 2001,"" reads a bronze plaque set in the stone, while the white flag of the country's new leaders flutters on a nearby gatehouse. two young fighters loiter listlessly just yards away. afghanistan's new modi mohammad hassan akhund was ""one of the architects of the destruction of buddhas"", according to historian ali a. olomi of penn state abington university. asked if it had been a good idea to blow up the statues -- regarded as one of the greatest crimes against world heritage -- young taliban member saifurrahman mohammadi does not hide his embarrassment. ""well... i can't really comment,"" said mohammadi, recently appointed to the bamiyan province cultural affairs office. ""i was very young,"" he told afp. ""if they did it, the islamic emirate must have had their reasons. ""but what is certain is that now we are committed to protecting the historical heritage of our country. it is our responsibility."" mohammadi said he recently spoke with unesco officials who fled abroad after the taliban takeover to ask them to return to afghanistan and guarantee their safety. local officials and former unesco employees formerly based there told afp that around a thousand priceless artefacts once stored in nearby warehouses were stolen or destroyed following the taliban takeover. ""i confirm that looting did take place, but it was before our arrival,"" mohammadi said, blaming the thefts on the vacuum left by the old authorities after they fled. ""we are investigating and we are trying to get them back,"" he added. crossroads of civilisations the bamiyan valley is nestled in the heart of the hindu kush mountain range and marks the westernmost reach of buddhism from its birthplace in the indian subcontinent. persian, turkish, chinese and greek influences have also intersected there over the centuries and left behind an extraordinary built environment, much of which remains unexplored. the statues survived a 17th-century incursion by mughal emperor aurangzeb, and later those of persian king nader shah, who damaged them with cannon fire. traces of them remain lying around the bamiyan site under canvas tents, torn by the winds of the valley. world heritage specialists are highly doubtful they will ever be rebuilt. but the new taliban regime insists that it wants to protect the country's archaeological heritage, despite the global shock triggered by the images of the buddhas disappearing in clouds of dust. with the country's economy reeling ""they realise that the work to protect heritage provides regular income,"" said philippe marquis, the director of the french archaeological delegation in afghanistan. labourers are working at bamiyan to put the final touches on a cultural centre and museum as part of a $20 million unesco-backed project that was to be inaugurated with great fanfare this month. ""now we have to see how it will work,"" said philippe delanghe, chief of the culture program at unesco's kabul office, currently based in france.   ""the current administration wants us to come back to work together. it seems pretty secure,"" he added. (this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

""while not yet a crisis of famine proportions, the negative trend, combined with external factors such as low yields in the previous year and flood damage to the northeastern croplands and crop transport infrastructure, aggravate the food insecurity in the country,"" the center for strategic and international studies said in a report released on monday. for the first time in months this week there were signs that north korea was accepting international aid, united nations agencies saying some shipments had entered the country and were now in quarantine in north korean ports. health and nutrition supplies from the united nations children's fund (unicef), and medical supplies to support anti-pandemic work from the world health organisation were among the aid that had reached north korea. the aid shipments have been pending for a long time, and don't likely signal a broader opening of borders as north korea has been letting in other goods for months, said chad o'carroll, ceo of the seoul-based korea risk group, which monitors north korea. ""north korea has been letting other goods into the country since may, including large volumes of what appears to be humanitarian assistance from china,"" he said. china's exports to north korea rose for the third straight month in august, to $22.5 million. that was a fraction of the $219 million of exports in august 2019, before the pandemic lockdowns. o'carroll said he thinks north korea will still be able to stave off major food shortages through the aid and imports from china.

""yes, the authorities should have done the needful..."" mr salve told a bench headed by chief justice nv ramana, on a day that one of the accused - ashish mishra, who has yet to be arrested - brazenly skipped summons from the police, leaving a senior official waiting. ashish mishra is union minister ajay mishra's son, and has been accused by farmers of being in the convoy that ran over a group of protesting farmers in up's lakhimpur kheri on sunday.  he has been accused of murder and negligence in a fir filed by the police. four farmers died as an suv rammed into a group of people who had their backs to the speeding oncoming vehicle. four others, including a journalist, died in the violence that followed. ""we are not satisfied with action taken by up government so far. we expect responsible government and police. the allegations are very serious, including gunshot injuries,"" the chief justice said. mr salve said the post-mortem did not show bullet wounds, but added ""... if the allegations (about the car running over farmers) are true... it is possibly section 302 (murder)"". to this justice hima kohli, part of the bench, responded: ""possibly?"" ""i said possibly because i don't want the accused to say tomorrow i made up my mind even before the appeared... evidence is strong (and) if true then it is section 302,"" mr salve said. ""what is the message you (the up government) are sending. even in normal circumstances will police not go immediately and apprehend the accused?"" the chief justice then asked mr salve. ""whosoever is involved... will they not be taken into custody. law should take its course,"" justice surya kant, also on the bench, added. the court also appeared to rule out a cbi probe at this stage (which was part of the pil's demands), noting ""cbi is not a solution... because of the persons (involved)"". on tuesday a top police official told ndtv the delay in arresting, or even questioning, ashish mishra was because the force is ""busy with negotiations....postmortems... cremations"". asked if the delay could be linked to the accused's obvious connections, sn sabat (adgp, lucknow zone) said: ""attitude of the police is towards the victim and not the accused."" ashish mishra was finally called for questioning yesterday, after the supreme court pulled up the up government and police, asking how many had been arrested and demanding a status report.   both ashish mishra and his father have denied all charges. mr mishra told ndtv that the car belonged to his family but neither he nor his son were in it when the incident took place. there have also been demands for ajay mishra to resign. mr mishra met his boss, union home minister amit shah, this week, after which government sources ruled out his quitting."

Zuckerberg Amid Profits Over Safety Charge","time magazine has featured mark zuckerberg on its cover in its latest issue amid claims facebook fuels division, harms children and puts profits over safety. the cover photo comes with an illustration of a phone app deletion icon and a seemingly simple question - ""delete 'facebook'?"" - and two options - ""cancel"" or ""delete"". whistleblower frances haugen, a former product manager on facebook's civic misinformation team, this week told us lawmakers how the company pushed for higher profits while being cavalier about user safety. she said facebook had also done too little to prevent its platform from being used by people planning violence. the time cover article, published on the magazine's website, is titled ""how facebook forced a reckoning by shutting down the team that put people ahead of profits"". the article speaks extensively of facebook's civic integrity team and points out to how the social media giant's decisions alienated many members of the critical team that fights misinformation and hate. facebook dissolved the team in december 2020, which eventually led frances haugen to blow the whistle. ""whatever the future direction of facebook, it is clear that discontent has been brewing internally. haugen's document leak and testimony have already sparked calls for stricter regulation and improved the quality of public debate about social media's influence,"" writes billy perrigo, the author of the article. earlier this week, mark zuckerberg hit back at the whistleblower's claims, saying they are ""just not true"".   ""the argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical,"" zuckerberg wrote in a note to facebook employees that he then posted on his account. ""i don't know any tech company that sets out to build products that make people angry or depressed. the moral, business and product incentives all point in the opposite direction."""

""he has harassed and intimidated the mother both before her departure to england and since,"" said the judge, and ""is prepared to countenance those acting on his behalf doing so unlawfully in the u.k."" sheikh mohammed denied the allegations in a statement to bloomberg. the case concerns ""supposed operations of state security"" and ""it was not appropriate for me"" to provide evidence on such sensitive matters, he said. ""the findings are therefore inevitably based on an incomplete picture"" and are also based on evidence ""not provided to me or my minders,"" said the sheikh. ""i therefore maintain that they were made in a manner which was unfair."" lawyers for princess haya declined to comment. the rulings by one of britain's most senior judges add to the embarrassment facing the dubai royal family. mcfarlane ruled early last year that sheikh mohammed conducted a campaign aimed at ""intimidating and frightening"" his estranged wife. nso's software has been found on phones belonging to journalists and activists with human rights groups accusing the israeli firm of using the technology to eavesdrop on conversations and track messages. the firm says its product is sold to law enforcement and intelligence agencies of vetted governments only. an nso document previously published by security researchers describes pegasus as a tool that can ""remotely and covertly extract valuable intelligence from virtually any mobile device."" it can be installed on a phone by tricking a targeted person into clicking a link, according to the document, or by forcing a phone to download the spy tool without any user interaction, usually by exploiting security vulnerabilities on the device. sheikh mohammed had stated that it was hard to see how the hacking allegations made a ""substantial difference"" to the issue of his contact with his children, according to mcfarlane. the judge said in wednesday's ruling that he considered the matter to be of the ""utmost seriousness,"" saying it may have a profound impact on his ability to trust the sheikh with anything but the ""most minimal and secure arrangements"" for contact with his children.   in a separate judgment, the judge also said that agents acting for the sheikh had tried to buy a 30 million-pound ($40.7 million) estate next to the princess's own property west of london. the judge said the princess rightly feared that the sheikh could use the estate in an attempt to abduct the children by offering a transport hub for a helicopter. the police, he said, have been given copies of the court orders preventing abduction."

This Year Too,"all eight winners of the 2021 nobel prizes in medicine, chemistry, physics and literature have been men, re-igniting a recurring debate about diversity in the highly coveted awards, particularly those in science. ardem patapoutian and david julius received the nobel for medicine on monday. giorgio parisi, syukuro manabe and klaus hasselmann won the physics gong for their work deciphering chaotic climate, while benjamin list and david macmillan received the chemistry accolade for developing a tool for molecule building. tanzanian novelist abdulrazak gurnah, 72, on wednesday became only the second writer of color in sub-suharan africa ever to win a nobel prize for literature. the last black recipient of the prize was toni morrison in 1993. ""abdulrazak gurnah meets at least one of the criterion of a writer from a non-traditional cultural circle - a non-european with a colonial background, but he's no woman,"" said anne-marie morhed, head of the swedish association of female academics. ""two prizes remain, the peace prize and the economy prize. the (norwegian) nobel committee... still have a chance to honor a woman."" exiled belarus opposition leader sviatlana tsikhanouskaya and greta thunberg are at least two women seen to be in contention when the nobel peace prize is awarded in norway on friday. the norwegian nobel committee is led by a woman and the majority of the members are women. ditto the previous committee: led by a woman and with a majority of women on it. there has also been a real push in recent years to not give the prize to only white men from north america and western europe, as was the case in the earlier decades. in comparison to the dozen black peace laureates in the nobel's history, there has never been a black recipient of the prizes for medicine, chemistry and physics, points out professor winston morgan, a toxicologist at the university of east london who has looked at representation in the prizes as part of his research on inequality in the sciences. ""in terms of the gap between the world's population and the winners - the biggest gap is a gender one,"" morgan said. ""the number of female prize winners is really, really tiny."" scientists of both genders have already taken to social media to decry the lack of women recognized so far this year. genderavenger, a non-profit group dedicated to advancing women's voices in public dialog, said the prizes were ""like a terrible mystery where you know the ending halfway through the book. 4 out of 6 categories announced and nary a woman in sight, @nobelprize. is the story of the 2021 nobel prize that the men did it? (spoiler: women are also doing amazing work).""   some, including ellie murray, an assistant professor of epidemiology at boston university school of public health, expressed disappointment that this year's awards excluded the contributions of katalin kariko and kizzmekia corbett, key scientists behind the development of mrna vaccines that are changing the course of the pandemic. nobel watchers, however, said it was entirely likely that kariko and corbett would be recognized in years to come. the committee, they said, tended to reward recipients after a period of time. ""the issue for the nobel prize is it has a criteria and a tradition and it is hard for them to break away from that,"" morgan said, adding that the committee would likely respond to scientific innovation during the pandemic in three or four years. he added that if you looked at the general trajectory of nobel prize winners, the number of women scientists was growing as were those given to men from japan and china. ""we are not seeing that same trajectory for black scientists. that concerns me more,"" he said. ""you need to ask are there enough black scientists in universities and are they being supported."" asked why there were so few black nobel prize winners for literature, gurnah told reuters the world was changing. jesper haeggstrom, chairman of the nobel assembly that awarded the prize in physiology or medicine, said there was no simple explanation for the lack of female prize winners, but that it reflected the representation of women in science. ""there has been an under-representation of women historically in science, so the further back in time you look, the fewer female candidates there are,"" he said. haeggstrom declined to say whether gender played a role in the committee's selection process. ""i'm not at liberty to give you any details on this, but in general terms, i can say that scientific competence is the deciding factor,"" he said. critics, however, point to the makeup of the scientific selection committees. only 25% of the 50 professors on the medicine selection committee are women.   the committee for physics at the royal swedish academy of sciences consists of six members, of which one is a woman, and two co-opted members, both men. the chemistry committee consists of six members, all male, and two co-opted members, both women.

""but this can't become a norm where citizens are saying that we have have a right o virtual hearing. in any event , their rights would be protected. if the judgement of this court is implemented and there is a telecast of the proceedings those fears are allayed .citizens right to continue virtual hearing does not appear o be reasonable. they want access to justice. access to justice is sitting in their hometowns and watching the proceedings,"" the bench said. mr swarup argued that there is another dimension, what if the citizen wants to access the justice himself and wants to address the court in person? the top court then asked ,""in how many parties in person are addressing this court. we have one or two persons in month."" mr swarup said that by adopting the virtual hearing, the citizen gets justice at much lower cost.

""steps are being taken to look into the matter in details and give the reply...the government is planning to implement the project on a time-bound manner after including it in its priority list,"" mr vijayan said. detailing the progress of the project, he said, the kerala state industrial development corporation had been appointed as the nodal agency for land acquisition and dpr preparation for the construction of the airport. the greenfield airport was proposed in pathanamthitta district for the convenience of sabarimala pilgrims and considering various criteria, the malayalam plantation, also known as cheruvally estate, was selected for the project, he said, adding that an in-principle nod was given by the government for the same in 2017. devaswom minister k radhakrishnan read out the reply of the chief minister in the house in his absence. according to sources, the dgca had raised certain issues about the proposed site for the sabarimala airport and had required modi could be carried out to address the concerns last month. they submitted the comments to the ministry of civil aviation on the site clearance approval for developing the airport after an inspection conducted by its officials. the airport is planned to be developed in the more than 2,200-acre cheruvally estate and would be about 48 kilometres away from the famed sabarimala lord ayyappa temple, a hill shrine visited by lakhs of pilgrims every year. noting that the proposed site is basically a hilly terrain, dgca said the site topography is similar to the calicut and mangaluru airports, and that also needs to be kept in mind while considering the proposal. in its submissions to the ministry, the watchdog said there may be a ""constraint in runway length and associated facilities"" and result in restriction on aircraft operation. another aspect is that the proposed airport falls within 150 kilometres aerial distance of two existing international airports -- cochin and thiruvananthapuram.   under the union government's greenfield airports policy, no greenfield aerodrome would be allowed within an aerial distance of 150 kilometres of an existing civilian airport.

""during the investigation, we found the girl's parents opposed the relationship. they gave money to maharaj punadleeka to murder arbaz,"" a senior police officer said. arbaz's mother, nazeema mohammad sheikh, had filed a complaint that arbaz was being threatened by the girl's family members. nazeema told police that fearing the safety of her son, she shifted to belagavi city, about 31 km away from khanapur where they were based earlier. on september 26, nazeema claimed, the girl's family called arbaz and her to khanapur, where they were asked to end the relationship, citing religious differences. during the meeting, the girl's family allegedly snatched arbaz's mobile and deleted the pictures and destroyed the sim card and threatened him, she alleged.   two days later, arbaz was called back by the girl's father and maharaj and murdered, police officials said. in order to destroy the evidence, they threw the body on the railway track, they added.

""mr salve, we have respect for you. we hope state will take necessary steps, due to the sensitive issue. we are not making comments (but) cbi is not a solution,"" the cji responded. the top court's reluctance to hand over the case to the cbi could be seen as concern over the agency's ability to conduct an impartial investigation, given that a union minister's son is among those accused. violence broke out in lakhimpur kheri this weekend after a convoy of cars - at least one of which belonged to union minister ajay mishra - rammed into a group of farmers holding a protest. four farmers were killed in the crash and four others, including a journalist and a bjp worker, died in the fight that broke out and left two vehicles ablaze. farmers have alleged the lead car - a suv - was driven by the minister's son, ashish, who has been charged with murder but has yet to be arrested. nearly a week after the incident, and after the supreme court questioned the up government and police, ashish mishra was summoned for questioning today. however, he skipped the summons, leaving a senior up police official waiting. senior up police officials have told ndtv there is no question of anyone being ""spared"".

""off for the by-elections,"" mr maken wrote in hindi, tagging the three leaders. the picture is seen by many as the party's attempt to present a united face in the state leadership, barely a week after mr gehlot's sharp political, message to opponents where he said, ""i am here to stay, i am not going anywhere for the next 15 to 20 years. some people may not like that but it can't be helped"". last month, sachin pilot's meeting with congress leaders rahul gandhi and priyanka gandhi vadra - days after a leadership change in punjab, a state ruled by the congress - had set off speculation of plans of a similar exercise in the state. mr pilot's meeting with the gandhis was his second meeting in less than a week. days later, mr gehlot - in his first public appearance after he recovered from an angioplasty - put to rest any speculation of a leadership change in rajasthan. ""for 15-20 years, nothing will happen to me. now if you want to be sad, be sad, it's not in my hands. nothing will happen to me),"" he said, asserting that his government will not only get re-elected to power in the next assembly elections, but that he himself will be around for the next 15-20 years. ashok gehlot has been under pressure for a while to go for a cabinet expansion to accommodate mr pilot's loyalists. so far the chief minister has resisted making the changes that his party leadership had promised to mr pilot, who was deputy chief minister till june last year when he was forced to resign.   mr gehlot - already a two-time chief minister by 2018 - was made the chief minister again after the congress won the assembly election that year. but it was not an easy decision for the party as mr pilot was also eyeing the top post. the younger congress leader is credited with rebuilding the party after its washout in the 2013 state election. last year, mr pilot supported by 18 congress mlas ended a month-long revolt against mr gehlot only after a meeting with the gandhis, who apparently assured him that their grievances would be heard by a three-member committee that includes priyanka gandhi."

""we are inclined to accept the guidelines and make them a part of the order of the court for the benefit of the courts below,"" the bench said. the category a offences include: a) ordinary summons at the 1st instance/including permitting appearance through lawyer; b) if such an accused does not appear despite service of summons, then bailable warrant for physical appearance may be issued; c) nbw on failure to failure to appear despite issuance of bailable warrant. further, nbw may be cancelled or converted into a bailable warrant/summons without insisting physical appearance of accused, if such an application is moved on behalf of the accused before execution of the nbw on an undertaking of the accused to appear physically on the next date/s of hearing. lastly, in category a, bail applications of such accused on appearance may be decided w/o the accused being taken in physical custody or by granting interim bail till the bail application is decided. the guidelines were issued for ""categories/types of offences"" which include offences punishable with imprisonment of seven years or less not falling in category b and d; offences punishable with death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for more than seven years; offences punishable under special acts containing stringent provisions for bail like narcotics drugs and psychotropic substances act, prevention of money-laundering act, unlawful activities (prevention) act, companies act and economic offences not covered by special acts. the requisite conditions include those not arrested during investigation, cooperated throughout in the probe including appearing before investigating officer whenever called, the sc said. the category would also include bail applications of such accused on appearance may be decided without the accused being taken in physical custody or by granting interim bail till the bail application is decided. category b and d would include appearance of the accused in court pursuant to process issued bail application to be decided on merits. the category c would include, ""same as category b and d with the additional condition of compliance of the provisions of bail under ndps, pmla, 212(6) companies act 43 d(5) of uapa, posco etc."" category a deals with both police and complaint cases. the top court said trial courts and high courts will keep in mind the aforesaid guidelines while considering bail applications. ""the caveat which has been put by asg is that where the accused have not cooperated in the investigation nor appeared before the investigating officers, nor answered summons when the court feels that judicial custody of the accused is necessary for the completion of the trial, where further investigation including a possible recovery is needed, the aforesaid approach cannot give them benefit, something we agree with,"" the bench said. the top court also noted that while issuing notice to consider bail, the trial court is not precluded from granting interim bail taking into consideration the conduct of the accused during the investigation which has not warranted arrest. ""on this aspect also we would give our imprimatur (a person's authoritative approval) and naturally the bail application to be ultimately considered, would be guided by the statutory provisions. the suggestions of asg which we have adopted have categorized a separate set of offences as ''economic offences'' not covered by the special acts,"" the bench said. the top court said that in determining whether to grant bail both aspects have to be taken into account-- seriousness of the charge and severity of punishment.

""republicans played a dangerous and risky partisan game, and i am glad that their brinksmanship did not work,"" he said on the senate floor. republican senate minority leader mitch mcconnell offered the deal wednesday as his party was set to vote against house-passed democratic plans for a hike in the nation's borrowing cap of more than a year. rather than solving the crisis, the new arrangement kicks the can down the road to coincide with another major funding deadline -- a shutdown that would kick in from december 3 when the government's coffers theoretically run out, closing federal services and properties and paralyzing much of washington and beyond. the house is expected to rubber-stamp the debt ceiling bill -- which passed the senate along party lines with no republican backing -- and send it to president joe biden's desk around the middle of next week. ""what is needed now is a long-term solution so we don't go through this risky drama every few months, and we hope republicans will join in enacting a long term solution to the debt limit in december,"" schumer added. ""we are ready to work with them."" ""manufactured crisis"" democrats will use the brief lull in hostilities to work on their multi-trillion dollar social spending package, the cornerstone of biden's economic agenda. mcconnell is hoping to use biden's sweeping proposals to campaign against ""reckless"" democratic spending and will bank on the prolonged debt uncertainty counting in republicans' favor ahead of next year's midterm elections. ""republican and democratic members and staff negotiated through the night in good faith,"" mcconnell said. ""the senate is moving toward the plan i laid out yesterday to spare the american people a manufactured crisis."" the lifting of the republican blockade ends for now an impasse that risked leaving the federal government incapable of securing and servicing loans after october 18. the united states spends more money than it collects through taxation so it borrows money via the issuing of government bonds seen as among the world's most reliable investments. around 80 years ago lawmakers introduced a limit on how much federal debt could be accrued. the ceiling has been lifted dozens of times to allow the government to meet its spending commitments -- usually without drama and with the support of both parties. even the threat of a default can spook financial markets and damage the economy. a first-ever actual default would have been felt around the globe. but republicans in both chambers of congress have been objecting this time round in protest at biden's social spending package, which is likely to have a final ticket price in excess of $1.5 trillion. it isn't legal however to raise the debt limit to cover future spending; it could only pay for past obligations and much of the $28 trillion national debt was accrued by republican administrations. mcconnell had been insisting since july that democrats suspend the debt limit with no republican help, through a laborious and partisan process known as budget reconciliation. but he reportedly became skittish over democratic calls wednesday to solve the issue via the ""nuclear option"" of modi the filibuster -- which normally requires 60 votes to pass legislation. ""uncertainty"" the legislative band-aid passed on thursday buys the democrats who control the white house and both chambers of congress time to pass a longer term debt limit extension, although they are still refusing to pursue reconciliation. they say the process would be too complex and risky. and since it requires no help from republicans, they worry that they will be forced to carry the political stigma of the $28 trillion-and-rising federal debt alone. but the olive branch has left some senators on both sides of the aisle -- and high-profile observers from near and far -- unsatisfied. across washington's national mall, the white house noted that it represented a deferment rather than a solution. the administration said biden ""looks forward to signing legislation"" but only after voicing its frustration with congress on wednesday, when press secretary jen psaki complained that the details presented ""more complicated, more difficult options"" than a straightforward longer-term solution would have. former president donald trump issued a statement from his home in florida endorsing the democratic interpretation of developments as a tactical retreat by the republicans.   ""republican senators, do not vote for this terrible deal being pushed by folding mitch mcconnell. stand strong for our country,"" he said.

""from orbital images, we knew it had to be water that formed the delta,"" williams said in a press release. ""but having these images is like reading a book instead of just looking at the cover."" finding out whether life may have existed on mars is the main mission of perseverence, a project that took decades and cost billions of dollars to develop. 'profound' mission over the course of several years, the multi-tasking rover will collect 30 rock and soil samples in sealed tubes, to be eventually sent back to earth sometime in the 2030s for lab analysis. last month mission scientists announced perseverance had collected two rock samples in jezero that showed signs they were in contact with groundwater for a long period. their hope is that the samples might at one point have hosted ancient microbial life, evidence of which could have been trapped by salt minerals. learning that mars might once have harboured life would be one of the most ""profound"" discoveries ever made by humanity, williams said. she also expressed wonder at having a window onto an ancient river system on another planet. ""it's really eye-opening to see something no one on earth has ever seen before,"" she said. perseverance landed on february 18, and the study looks at long-distance images it captured during its first three months on mars. about the size of an suv, it is equipped with 19 cameras, a two metre (seven foot) long robotic arm, two microphones, and a suite of cutting-edge instruments. one of them is called the supercam, a tool that laser-zaps rocks from a distance in order to study their vapour with a device that reveals their chemical composition. it took seven months for perseverance to travel from earth to mars with its sister craft ingenuity, a tiny helicopter whose rotors have to spin five times faster than earth versions to get lift in the far-less-dense atmosphere.   the plan is for the rover to cross the delta, then the ancient lake shore, and finally explore the edges of the crater.

""many parents are foregoing food so that their children can eat,"" she has said. in recent days, western diplomats and officials have stepped up efforts to establish a cash lifeline. the united nations world food programme has distributed about 10 million afghanis ($110,000) in cash via a local bank and intends to disburse more soon, said one person with knowledge of the situation. the cash runs are a trial for larger air deliveries of dollars from pakistan, the person said. a senior diplomat said two approaches are under consideration that would inject cash into the afghan economy. both are in the planning stages. under the first plan, the world food programme would fly in cash and distribute it directly to people to buy food, expanding on something the agency already has been doing on a smaller scale. the second approach would see cash flown in to be held by banks on behalf of the united nations. that would be used to pay salaries to the staff of u.n. agencies and non-governmental organizations, the diplomat said. a third person said u.n. officials had talked with afghan banks about opening up cash distribution channels. ""if the country collapses, we will all pay the consequences,"" said a senior european union official. ""no one wants to rush into a recognition of the taliban, but we need to deal with them. the question is not if ... but how."" a spokesperson for the world food programme said it had helped almost 4 million people in september, nearly triple the august number, chiefly with food, and some cash assistance had been given out in kabul. the spokesperson said the cash shortage was also affecting the millers and truckers it worked with. he said that the agency was not flying cash into afghanistan. nine-billion-dollar leverage separately, the european union, britain and the united states have discussed setting up an international trust fund to bypass the afghan government and help finance local services, according to two officials with knowledge of the matter. the taliban did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the cash airlift plans. a u.s. treasury spokesperson said it would allow humanitarian assistance through independent international and non-governmental organisations while ""denying assets"" to the taliban and sanctioning its leaders. the kabul government has little to fall back on. the central bank, with assets of $9 billion frozen offshore, has burnt through much of its reserves at home. shah mehrabi, an official who helped oversee the bank before the taliban took over and is still in his post, recently appealed for a release of the overseas reserves. ""if reserves remain frozen, afghan importers will not be able to pay for their shipments, banks will start to collapse, food will be become scarce,"" he said. but there is also a debate about whether strings should be attached to cash releases. in a paper written last month and seen by reuters, french and german officials outline their aim of using money as a ""lever"" to pressure the taliban. ""countries could condition recognition of the political ... legitimacy of the taliban to the commitments they would be ready to take,"" officials said in the two-page report. ""economic and trade levers are among the strongest we have,"" the note said, raising the prospect of releasing the afghan reserves held abroad. in a separate diplomatic note, french and german officials outline five demands that could be made of the taliban.   those include allowing afghans who want to leave the country to do so, ""breaking ties with ... terrorist organisations"", allowing access to humanitarian aid, respect for human rights and establishing an ""inclusive government"".

""the decision was taken after close technical cooperation between our ministries taking public health factors into account,"" a british high commission spokesperson said in a statement on thursday. the spokesperson said the uk keeps efficacy data and information on vaccine rollout internationally under review, and has kept visa rules under constant review throughout the pandemic to keep borders open whilst gradually and safely restarting travel. if a person isn't fully vaccinated with one of the four uk-recognised vaccines -  oxford/astrazeneca, pfizer biontech, moderna and janssen - or any formulation of these vaccines, including covishield, the person must take a pre-departure test, and must take a covid test on or before day 2 and on or after day 8, and self-isolate for 10 days. india's foreign secretary harsh shringla had called the uk rules ""discriminatory"" and warned that ""reciprocal action"" may be warranted.   british officials had told ndtv that the issue was not the vaccine itself but the issues with india's ""vaccination certification"" process and the two sides announced ""progress"" in recognising each other's certificates after high-level talks. dr rs sharma, ceo of india's national health authority, said certification after covid vaccinations in india is a centralised national system managed through the cowin app and portal and there are ""no issues"" with the platform which is entirely compliant with world health organisation standards."

""so, we're in a situation where we're facing a really extraordinary dilemma that it's going to be tough for us to mitigate the humanitarian crisis without empowering the taliban,"" he said in response to a question on wednesday. ""i don't think we should give any assistance to pakistan at all. i think pakistan has had it both ways for way too long. i think pakistan should be confronted with its behaviour over the years that has actually resulted, i think, in large measure in this outcome,"" said mr mcmaster, who served as national security advisor during the trump administration. it was during the trump administration that the us had blocked all security assistance to pakistan. the biden administration has not resumed the security aid yet. ""i think we ought to hold imran khan responsible for his comments when kabul fell and he said that the afghan people have been unshackled. why should we send a dime to pakistan under any conditions? i think that they should be confronted with international isolation because of their support for jihadist terrorists, who are threats to humanity, including haqqani network, the taliban, and groups like lashkar-e-taiba,"" he said. pakistan-based lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed as well as afghanistan-based haqqani network are proscribed terror entities under unsc resolution 1267 concerning isil (da'esh), al-qaeda, and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities. pakistani radical cleric hafiz saeed's jamat-ud-dawa (jud) is the front organisation for the lashkar-e-taiba which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 mumbai terror attack that killed 166 people, including six americans. responding to a question from congress scott perry, during the congress hearing convened by the house foreign affairs committee, mcmaster said that it is a good idea to remove pakistan's status as a major non-nato ally. ""i would say the only time i think we have ever laid out a very clear and realistic assessment of south asia and prioritised the strategy was president trump's speech in august of 2017. now, he abandoned it and he doubled down on the flaws of the obama administration. i don't know how that happened. but i think if you go back to that august 2017 speech, that was the proper approach to pakistan as well, which called for a suspension of all assistance to pakistan until pakistan fundamentally changed its behaviour,"" mr mcmaster said. congress bill keating said pakistan remains a problem and the us needs to assess it. ""its long standing activities, by many accounts, have been negative. i think that's putting it mildly. for decades, though, for decades, whether you go back to '96 when the taliban took control, pakistan was one of the first to recognise them,"" he said. ""when you go through the change in 2001 in afghanistan and then the reconstruction of the taliban starting around 2005, they were there giving assistance, by all accounts, and i believe those accounts are accurate. and indeed, right up into this current change in the government, pakistan, there were many people that suggested their intelligence was embedded with them,"" mr keating said. pakistan's relationship with the haqqani network is one that is of great concern. ""that may indeed affect our relations with india in that respect. but can you comment on that? i think they have been duplicitous, not just recently, not just in the few months of this administration, but for decades in this with many administrations, republican and democratic alike,"" he said. former us ambassador to pakistan ryan croker acknowledged that pakistan worked against the us in some very fundamental aspects with their support for the taliban. ""earlier, i tried to present their narrative as to why. we were going to walk out, and they did not want to be left with the taliban as a mortal enemy. they may get that anyway. and as satisfying as it would be to a lot of us, myself included, to do something to punish pakistan for this, i don't think we have the luxury. they are already worried over the repercussions inside their own country of the taliban's so-called victory in afghanistan,"" he said. ""now, we can say, 'yeah. well, they deserve whatever they get'. but again, a blow-up in kashmir is going to bring a regional war. so, i think reassessment is always good, but let's reassess with a clear eye on the dangers now that the taliban takeover of afghanistan has created throughout the region. we do not need a completely destabilized pakistani state with nuclear weapons,"" mr croker said. mr mcmaster told the lawmakers that the taliban was backed by isi and that's why they recaptured afghanistan. ""the taliban's differential advantage was the backing by the isi of other groups. but it was the unscrupulous units who are willing to terrorise. they didn't give up their differential advantage. and so, i don't think it's a mystery at all why they collapsed. and i think it should be unacceptable, to disparage the afghans who did fight, and over 60,000 of them made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve the freedoms we're now seeing,"" he said. the taliban, he said, went around to the afghan units, and they said, ""hey, here's how this is going to go."" with the backing of the pakistani spy agency isi, intertwined with the haqqani network and al-qaeda, what they did is they told those commanders, ""hey, listen. you accommodate us. we give you the signal, or we kill your family. how does that sound?"" he said. ""and that's why the afghan forces collapsed in addition to the withdrawal of us intelligence support, the withdrawal of our airpower, which was the afghan forces' differential advantage,"" mr mcmaster said.

""he is not accused of having shot anyone in particular, but of having contributed to these acts through his work as a guard and of having been aware such killings were happening at the camp,"" a court spokeswoman said. thomas walther, a lawyer representing several camp survivors and victims' relatives in the case, said that even 76 years on from the war, such trials were necessary. ""there's no expiry date on justice,"" he told afp. one of his clients is antoine grumbach, 79, who hopes schuetz will shed light on the methods used to kill people in the camp, but also that the accused ""will say 'i was wrong, i am ashamed'"". - 'symbolic' - the nazi ss guard worked at the sachsenhausen camp which detained more than 200,000 people between 1936 and 1945, including jews, roma, regime opponents and gay people. tens of thousands of inmates died from forced labour, murder, medical experiments, hunger or disease before the camp was liberated by soviet troops, according to the sachsenhausen memorial and museum. little is known about the accused, beyond the fact that he was released from captivity as a prisoner of war in 1947 and went to work as a locksmith in the brandenburg region of what was then communist east germany, the bild newspaper reported. the file against him was transferred by the central unit investigating nazi crimes to the state of brandenburg, where he lives, in april 2019, and charges were eventually filed on january 26 this year. co-plaintiff christoffel heijer, 84, told afp his father was shot dead in the camp in may 1942.

""biodiversity is declining at unprecedented rates,"" cbd executive secretary elizabeth maruma mrema told afp in an interview. ""about one million animal and plant species out of 8.1 million are threatened with extinction -- more than ever before in human history."" humanity's expanding footprint is also undermining the ecosystems that produce the clean air, drinkable water, food, medicine and raw materials we need to survive. ""our relationship with nature must change,"" said maruma mrema. the covid pandemic, thought to have originated from a virus in wild animals, is a ""brutal reminder"" of the price we can pay for neglecting or abusing nature, she said. - what has the cbd achieved? - at the 2010 biodiversity summit in aichi, japan, cbd member states laid out 20 goals to preserve biological diversity and reduce human pressures on the environment, setting a 2020 deadline for achieving them. none of the objectives was fulfilled by that deadline, and -- with a few exceptions -- conditions are generally worse today than when the goals were first set. this year's negotiations will likely see a new set of targets designed to allow our species to ""live in harmony with nature"", with a 2050 deadline and 2030 checkpoints. - what are this year's goals? - the draft text under negotiation, the framework biodiversity convention, provisionally sets 21 ""targets"" for 2030. these include according protected status to 30 percent of lands and oceans, a measure supported by a broad coalition of nations, including france and costa rica. another goal is to halve the use of fertilisers so that less of the nitrogen-rich substance leaches into fresh and ocean waters. the draft pact also calls for reducing pesticide use by at least two thirds, and for halting the discharge of plastic waste entirely. another measure would see subsidies for environmentally harmful industries reduced by ""at least $500 billion per year"". without money and enforcement, however, these measures risk becoming empty promises, experts warn. - are cop15 and cop26 linked? - yes and no. negotiations under the two conventions unfold on separate tracks and do not intersect. but parties to both treaties are increasingly looking for overlapping solutions. ""we cannot solve climate change without biodiversity and we cannot solve biodiversity loss without climate change,"" maruma mrema said. ""they are two intertwined crises and they need to be addressed together."" healthy ecosystems -- especially forest and oceans -- make better carbon sinks to absorb co2 pollution. these in turn are vital to keep global warming down to levels that are survivable for humanity and other species. - what is china's role? - maruma mrema says that china's status as host for the negotiations means the world's top carbon polluter and most populous nation will be ""taking global leadership on the biodiversity agenda"". a statement known as the kunming declaration to be unveiled at the opening next week will set the tone for china's leadership, said li shuo, global policy advisor for greenpeace china. ""beijing has the task of rescuing a weak environmental convention from the verge of a reputational collapse,"" he said.   ""it carries the mission to boost biodiversity protection to the same rank as climate change, a task that has proven beyond its reach so far.""

""if they disappear, we'll disappear with them,"" he says of the vibrant corals on the reef, a species-rich ecosystem just below the turquoise waters that is beloved by diving enthusiasts worldwide. coral reefs -- often dubbed the ""rainforests of the oceans"" for their rich biodiversity -- are under threat everywhere as rising sea temperatures and acidification cause catastrophic ""bleaching"" events. along with pollution and dynamite fishing, global warming wiped out 14 percent of the world's coral reefs between 2009 and 2018, says a new survey by the global coral reef monitoring network, the biggest ever carried out. some studies have suggested that many species of coral in the red sea -- which is also bordered by the saudi peninsula, sudan and eritrea -- are unusually heat-resistant, but local professionals say they have already witnessed the damage. ""we can see the effects of global warming before our eyes,"" said islam mohsen, 37, another local diving instructor at the resort town of sharm el-sheikh. ""we can see the coral discolouring and turning white."" - biodiversity hotspots - coral reefs cover only a tiny fraction -- 0.2 percent -- of the ocean floor, but they are home to at least a quarter of all marine animals and plants. the red sea and gulf of aden boast the most biologically diverse coral reef communities outside of southeast asia. the red sea -- with just over five percent of the world's coral reefs -- is home to 209 types of coral, according to egypt's environment ministry. the new global survey said that live hard coral cover in the region fluctuated over recent decades but declined overall, from 36.1 percent in 1997 to 34.3 percent in 2019. causes for the degraded reefs varied by location but included tourism activities, coastal development, land runoff and overfishing, the report said. steps have been taken in egypt to protect reefs and marine life that are crucial to the local tourism sector. egypt's chamber of diving and water sports -- which oversees 269 diving centres and over 2,900 professional divers -- has protected fragile areas with buoys to keep boats from mooring. it has also suspended beginners' diving classes in some areas to allow damaged reefs to recover. but the largest looming threat, far harder to fix, is global warming. - marine heatwaves - oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions, shielding land surfaces but generating huge, long-lasting marine heatwaves. these are pushing many species of corals past their limits of tolerance. ""when the temperature of the ocean goes up, it absorbs more carbon dioxide, which creates carbonic acid,"" said cairo-based climate change consultant katherine jones. ""so not only will the temperature increase, but the ph level will change too,"" affecting all animals with shells, she said. ""we will lose a lot of wildlife, and the ecosystem will be changing in a way that affects us as humans in terms of resources. ""the coral reefs are nurseries to baby fish and a feeding ground to bigger fish ... it's an essential part of the ecosystem."" sharm el-sheikh hosted a united nations agencies conference in 2018 that called for the protection of coral reefs ""before it's too late"". egypt also plans to host the climate conference of the parties (cop27) in november next year. a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change has warned that up to 90 percent of coral reefs ""may be gone by mid-century"" even if the rise in temperatures stabilises below 1.5 degrees celsius. jones warned that, as things stand now, climate change and its impacts can no longer be reversed -- only slowed -- to prevent the worst consequences.   ""even if humans completely disappear from earth tomorrow or we stopped producing any kind of emissions,"" she said, ""the temperature will continue to rise by itself.""

""social media has become a coward's palace where people can go on there, not say who they are, destroy people's lives, and say the most foul and offensive things to people, and do so with impunity,"" morrison told reporters in canberra. ""they should have to identify who they are, and the companies, if they're not going to say who they are, well, they're not a platform anymore, they're a publisher. you can expect us to be leaning further into this,"" he added. a facebook spokesperson did not directly respond to a reuters question about morrison's remarks, but said the company was actively engaging with the review. ""we support modernisation of australia's uniform defamation laws and hope for greater clarity and certainty in this area,"" the spokesperson said. ""recent court decisions have reaffirmed the need for such law reform."" a representative for twitter inc's australian unit did not address the question of potential liability but said ""anonymity or pseudonymity is not a shield against terms of service violations, and twitter will take action against any accounts that are in violation of the twitter rules"". since the court ruling, cnn, which is owned by at&t inc, has blocked australians from its facebook pages https://www.reuters.com/technology/cnn-quits-facebook-australia-citing-defamation-risk-2021-09-29, citing concern about defamation liability, while the australian arm of british newspaper the guardian says it has disabled comments below most articles posted to the platform. australia has butted heads with facebook previously, enacting a new law this year that forces it and google to pay for links to media companies' content. review in focus federal attorney-general michaelia cash said in an oct. 6 letter to state counterparts that she had ""received considerable feedback from stakeholders regarding the potential implications of the high court's decision"". ""while i refrain from commenting on the merits of the court's decision, it is clear ... that our work to ensure that defamation law is fit-for-purpose in the digital age remains critical,"" said the letter which was seen by reuters. no timeline has been given for how long the review might last. new south wales state attorney general mark speakman, who is leading it, said media, social media and law firms attended three consultations in the past month. the review, which has been running through 2021, has published 36 submissions on its website, including one from facebook which says it should not be held liable for defamatory comments since it has relatively little ability to monitor and remove content posted under publishers' pages. while news outlets were among the first to criticise the ruling, lawyers have warned all australian sectors which rely on social media to interact with the public are potentially liable. ""the decision has significant implications for those who operate online forums ... which allow third-parties to make comments,"" a law council of australia spokesperson said. ""it is not limited to news organisations.""   the leaders of the state of tasmania and the australian capital territory, home to canberra, are among those who have disabled comments from facebook pages, citing the high court ruling.

""the light at the end of the tunnel is now very, very close,"" modi scott morrison said thursday, hailing the reopening announcement. from monday, pubs, restaurants and shops will throw open their shutters and welcome back the fully vaccinated. five-kilometre travel restrictions will also be lifted, although state and international borders will remain closed for now. the reopening -- described by many as ""freedom day"" -- is both ""exciting"" and ""nerve-racking"" according to alyce murphy, general manager of the carrington, a sydney pub now hustling to get staff and deliveries back on site. ""obviously going from doing nothing for months, and then the prospect of having a few weeks to get the venue there was a little bit daunting,"" she said. murphy tried to fill the almost four-month lockdown with activities such as painting and gardening. but like millions of australians, she ""also just sat on the couch and watched tv a lot"". lockdown under australia has been spared the worst of the pandemic -- recording 1,379 deaths in a population of around 26 million. but for the last 18 months, under-vaccinated australian cities have endured several gruelling lockdowns to limit the spread of the virus. jobs have been lost, kids have missed being at school for a large portion of the academic year, and restrictions have sparked a string of mostly small but noisy protests and a flood of online misinformation. there is growing evidence that locked-down australians have been drinking more and existing mental conditions have worsened, according to a recent report by the country's mental health think tank. in recent months, australia's repeated imposition of restrictions and efforts -- now abandoned -- to reach covid zero"" have brought it international attention.  the conservative-run country has become an unlikely lightning rod for the american right keen to vent against vaccine mandates and lockdowns everywhere. florida governor ron desantis -- whose state has recorded 55,000-plus deaths in a population slightly smaller than australia -- even suggested breaking off diplomatic relations. ""it's not a free country at all,"" he said. ""is australia freer than communist china right now? i don't know."" thousands of australian residents have also chafed at the restrictions, and some have voted with their feet. the country's population has shrunk for the first time since world war i, as expatriates returned home in droves. that has hit the hospitality and retail sectors which report staff shortages and logistics bottlenecks at warehouses that could make reopening difficult. 'critical time' some medical experts are also concerned that new south wales state, of which sydney is the capital, may be reopening too soon. the government's own health advice from the doherty institute recommended widespread reopening when vaccination rates reached 80 percent rather than the current 70 percent. the australian medical association warned thursday that infections will rise with reopening and underfunded hospitals risk being overwhelmed. ""new south wales must not be reckless at this critical time,"" the group's president omar khorshid said. ""that would cost more lives, cause more suffering, and put the economies of new south wales and the nation at risk.""   but recently installed state premier dominic perrottet was adamant about the reopening. on thursday, he brought forward the date for most schools to resume and said masks would not be needed in offices.    both measures are designed to get people back to work.

""there can be no doubt that this deliberate behaviour, both in negotiating a purchase and then withholding information about it, by those who are acting for the benefit of the dubai ruling family, will have had the effect of intimidating this mother to a very marked degree,"" he said in a ruling published on wednesday. haya said she feared the plans would allow the sheikh - who the judge has also ruled hacked her phone and those of her lawyers - to spy on her or possibly try to abduct their two children. ""it feels like i am being stalked ... the prospect of sheikh mohammed, or those on his behalf buying the properties around castlewood is terrifying and utterly wearing,"" she said in a written statement to the court. haya's lawyers said they first became aware of the sheikh's plans in late 2019, and unsuccessfully sought confirmation from his legal team that he would not to buy any properties near her castlewood home in berkshire, close to windsor great park where queen elizabeth's son prince andrew's home is located. in late 2020, haya received information that a trust connected to mohammed was trying to buy the 72-acre parkwood estate immediately abutting castlewood, which had been left to her by her father, the late king hussein of jordan. after the sheikh's lawyers failed to reply to requests from haya's legal team about the intended purchase, in november 2020 they responded to a direct request from the high court to confirm the trust was in the process of buying parkwood and it might well take place in the next few weeks. the same month, those acting for the sheikh confirmed they would not go ahead with the purchase of the estate, which mcfarlane said ""comprises, according to press reports, the most expensive development land currently on the market"". ""quite simply, if it were not for the mother's persistence and my lord's assistance in demanding an answer, the purchase of a property sitting right on top of the mother would have gone ahead,"" haya's lawyer charles geekie said. ""it is an absolute game changer when the threat is on your doorstep."" mohammed's lawyer told the court that the trust behind the property dealings regularly sought commercial opportunities in the area. the following month, the judge agreed to extend a ""non-molestation order"" against mohammed. this included a 100-metre exclusion zone around castlewood for the father or those acting for him, a no-fly zone to stop aircraft or drones flying between the ground and 1,000ft above her estate, and a wider area in which he could not buy or rent any property.   the sheikh's lawyers had argued that haya's initial request for a 14.8 km (9 mile) exclusion zone would have prevented him from being able to access windsor and ascot racecourses and windsor castle, queen elizabeth's residence to the west of london, and mcfarlane said he agreed to ""radically"" reduce its size.

'ideal time' ""india is the second-largest country in the world and has one of the fastest-growing economies,"" 7-eleven's president and chief executive officer joe depinto said in the statement. ""it's an ideal time for the largest convenience retailer in the world to make our entry into india."" 7-eleven's entry also comes at a fortuitous moment as india enjoys a relative lull of covid infections after a devastating wave battered the country just months ago. daily cases are now hovering near a 7-month low and lockdown restrictions have largely been lifted across the country as india's vaccination drive gains momentum. many foreign firms have long coveted access to india's market of about 1.4 billion people in a country where discretionary spending in on the rise. however, they have faced considerable hurdles to entry and political opposition given the ubiquity of the kirana store, small-scale mom-and-pop shops that account for about three-quarters of india's retail landscape. ""to make a dent, reliance will need to have similar penetration over time,"" said utkarsh sinha, managing director of mumbai-based bexley advisors ltd. ""one tailwind in their favor is going to be the market's affinity for brands: as long as they are able to build it up, they can cause a shift in shopping behavior."" changing landscape the deal between the two companies is a ""good fit"" that can harness reliance's digital reach and gives mr ambani a ""last-mile linkage to the consumer,"" according to saloni nangia, president at retail consultancy technopak advisors pvt.

""the aftereffects of covid are substantial,"" said ziyad al-aly, director of the clinical epidemiology center at the veterans affairs st. louis health care system in missouri, who led the research. ""governments and health systems must wake up to the reality that covid will cast a tall shadow in the form of long covid and has devastating consequences. i am concerned that we are not taking this seriously enough."" the chances of a heart attack, stroke, or other major cardiovascular event in the first 12 months of covid recovery increase with the severity of the initial illness, the researchers found. they compared the risks of heart complications in 151,195 veterans who survived covid to the risk in more than 3.6 million of their peers who didn't contract the pandemic disease. the data were collected from the largest integrated health-care system in the u.s. most of its users are are white and male, which may limit how generalizable the study's findings are to other groups, the authors said. they found non-hospitalized covid patients had a 39% increased risk of developing heart failure and a 2.2-fold increased risk of a potentially deadly blood clot, known as a pulmonary embolism, in the following year, compared with someone who didn't develop the disease. that works out to an extra 5.8 cases of heart-failure and 2.8 cases of pulmonary embolism for every 1,000 covid patients who were never hospitalized. intensive care being hospitalized for covid is associated with a 5.8-fold increased risk of cardiac arrest and almost a 14-fold greater chance of myocarditis, or inflammation or the heart muscle, the study found. covid patients who needed intensive care are at significantly greater risk, with almost one in seven suffering a major adverse cardiac event that they wouldn't have otherwise had within a year.   researchers are still trying to unravel the causes of heart damage in covid patients. possible mechanisms include lingering damage from direct viral invasion of heart-muscle cells and the cells that line blood vessels, blood clots and aberrant and persistent inflammation, the authors said. the findings from natural disasters and previous pandemics suggest indirect effects of covid including social isolation, financial distress, changes in dietary habits and physical activity, as well as trauma and grief, may also influence the risks for cardiovascular disease, they said."

""it is the responsibility of all to observe health protocols at the places of worship in view of the covid pandemic,"" he said. the chief minister said he prayed to goddess mumba devi to eradicate the covid completely. he said the trustees and priests of all places of worship should ensure that devotees follow discipline while offering prayers, and the shrine premises are cleaned and sanitised frequently and proper social distancing is followed. ""we can set an example in this regard,"" he said. he also praised places of worship like the famous siddhivinayak temple in mumbai for using qr code and other technologies to facilitate online darshan for devotees. after the first covid wave waned, places of religious worship were reopened in maharashtra in november last year, but they were closed again for people after the second wave started in the state in march 2021. for long, the opposition bjp had been demanding reopening of temples and other places of worship in maharashtra. the party staged protests in august in several cities of maharashtra in support of its demand. the maharashtra government last month announced reopening of all religious places from october 7 in the state with covid protocols, a move that comes amid indication that the second wave of the pandemic is ebbing. besides mumbai, religious places in other parts of the state also reopened on thursday.

""i would be more than surprised if we are not going to start to see a lot of breakthrough infections in the united states,"" among those who have received just two doses, regev-yochay said. the israel findings were bolstered by a second real-world study from qatar, published in the same journal, that found the efficacy of the pfizer-biontech shot faded over a similar time period. protection fell from 77.5% during the first month after the second dose to 20% in months five to seven after the second dose. still, the research found, prevention of severe and fatal infections remained strong throughout the study period, reaching 96% in the first two months after the second dose and persisting at roughly this level for six months. consistent data ""the data is consistent,"" said laith abu-raddad, a coauthor of the paper who studies infectious disease epidemiology at weill cornell medicine-qatar.

""obviously the two countries, france and australia, share a number of common interests, particularly in our work together in the region. so, let's hope we can get that relationship back on track,"" he told channel 9 television. french president emmanuel macron reacted furiously to australia's announcement on september 15 that it had secretly lined up a new, nuclear-powered submarine deal with the united states and britain. french foreign minister jean-yves le drian accused australia of back-stabbing and the united states of betrayal, calling the move reminiscent of the unilateralist attitude of former president donald trump. paris recalled its envoys to both australia and the united states over the furore. but macron later ordered the ambassador to washington to return to his post after a call with us president joe biden, which helped soothe tensions. france, however, made clear it was not in a rush to mend fences with australia, and kept its envoy to canberra in paris.   france's anger stemmed not only from the financial loss of the submarine deal but also the shattering of an alliance with australia that it saw as a cornerstone of its indo-pacific security strategy.

""these travel measures, along with mandatory vaccination for federal employees, are some of the strongest in the world,"" trudeau told reporters. ""if you've done the right thing and gotten vaccinated, you deserve the freedom to be safe from covid there are almost 300,000 federal service workers, plus 955,000 federally regulated workers, representing about 8% of canada's full-time workforce, according to the treasury board, which manages the public service. the government's new vaccine mandates were a cornerstone pledge by trudeau during his campaign for re-election last month. the liberals returned to power in a closely contested election, but fell short of winning a majority. canada has fully vaccinated more that 80% of its eligible population ages 12 and over. canada's neighbor to the south, the united states, said last month most federal employees must be fully vaccinated against covid no later than nov. 22, while federal contractors must be vaccinated by dec. 8. the u.s. government also is drafting rules to require large employers to have their workers inoculated or tested weekly. some other countries also have pursued vaccine mandates for government employees. fiji  in august forced public workers to go on leave if unvaccinated. if still not inoculated by november, they would lose their jobs. later this month, italy will require proof of vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery from infection for all the country's workers. during his re-election bid, trudeau often faced anti-vaccine protesters, one of whom hurled a handful of gravel at him at a campaign event last month. his main opponent, conservative leader erin o'toole, opposed vaccine mandates. the mandate for federal employees is likely to be challenged in court, said daniel lublin, a toronto-based employment lawyer. ""there will be claims,"" lublin said, noting that unpaid leave could be challenged as effective termination or unjust dismissal. concerns on implementation the public service alliance of canada (psac), which represents 215,000 federal workers including 8,500 border guards, said that while the union supports the government's vaccination stance, the policy was set out without proper consultation. the union was given a draft only late on friday, said chris aylward, psac president. ""the way that this policy was announced leaves us basically with our hands up in the air saying, how is this going to be implemented?"" aylward said in a phone interview. ""this was simply an opportunity for the modi to tick off an election promise."" the national airlines council of canada, which represents the country's major air carriers, said it welcomed the rules but ""urgently"" needed to engage with officials about implementation. members of the royal canadian mounted police (rcmp) are among those who must be vaccinated, and the government has asked the head of the armed forces staff to require inoculations. a spokesman for the national police federation, which represents the nearly 20,000 rcmp employees, had no immediate comment. canada's vaccine mandate for federal workers, first promised on aug. 13, will be reassessed every six months and stay in place until the policy is no longer required, one official said. for travelers, a negative covid test will not be accepted as a replacement for proof of vaccination after nov. 30, officials said. children under 12 who are not eligible for vaccination will be exempted from the travel mandate.   the government also said it is working with industry to put a strict vaccine requirement in place for cruise ships before the resumption of the 2022 cruise season.

""while in power in the state from 2014 to 2019, the bjp was the number one party in local body elections and despite being in the opposition now, the same trend continues,"" mr patil said. he said in the 2019 assembly elections, the bjp won an absolute majority by forming an alliance (with the shiv sena). despite that it has to sit in the opposition (after the sena walked out of the saffron alliance), but the bjp still has the support of the people, the former minister said. mr patil expressed confidence that the bjp will win the upcoming assembly bypolls in deglur in nanded district. the supreme court in march this year had read down the obc quota in local bodies. following the sc order, the obc seats in dhule, nandurbar, akola, washim, nagpur and palghar zps and panchayat samitis falling under them got converted to general category seats. as a result, seats in the 85 wards of these six zps and 144 wards in the panchayat samiti fell vacant. candidate in one of these seats from dhule zp, nominees from two seats from shirpur panchayat samiti in dhule, and one from akkalkuwa panchayat samiti were declared elected unopposed. last month, the maharashtra state election commission had declared byelections to six zps and the panchayat samitis under them for the seats that fell vacant after the sc order. the sec had earlier declared that these bypolls will be held on july 19, but they were postponed due to the covid pandemic.   on september 9, the supreme court ruled that covid restrictions were not applicable for bypolls and directed the maharashtra sec to announce fresh dates.

""so, we're in a situation where we're facing a really extraordinary dilemma that it's going to be tough for us to mitigate the humanitarian crisis without empowering the taliban,"" he said in response to a question. ""i don't think we should give any assistance to pakistan at all. i think pakistan has had it both ways for way too long. i think pakistan should be confronted with its behavior over the years that has actually resulted, i think, in large measure in this outcome,"" mcmaster said. it was during the trump administration that the us had blocked all security assistance to pakistan. the biden administration has not resumed the security aide yet. ""i think we ought to hold imran khan responsible for his comments when kabul fell and he said that the afghan people have been unshackled. why should we send a dime to pakistan under any conditions? i think that they should be confronted with international isolation because of their support for jihadist terrorists, who are threats to humanity, including haqqani network, the taliban, and groups like lashkar-e-taiba,"" he said. responding to a question from congress scott perry, during the congress hearing convened by the house foreign affairs committee, mcmaster said that it is a good idea to remove pakistan's status as a major non-nato ally. ""i would say the only time i think we have ever laid out a very clear and realistic assessment of south asia and prioritised the strategy was president trump's speech in august of 2017. now, he abandoned it and he doubled down on the flaws of the obama administration. i don't know how that happened. but i think if you go back to that august 2017 speech, that was the proper approach to pakistan as well, which called for a suspension of all assistance to pakistan until pakistan fundamentally changed its behaviour,"" mcmaster said. congress bill keating said pakistan remains a problem and the us needs to assess it. ""its long standing activities, by many accounts, have been negative. i think that's putting it mildly. for decades, though, for decades, whether you go back to''96 when the taliban took control, pakistan was one of the first to recognise them,"" he said. ""when you go through the change in 2001 in afghanistan and then the reconstruction of the taliban starting around 2005, they were there giving assistance, by all accounts, and i believe those accounts are accurate. and indeed, right up into this current change in the government, pakistan, there were many people that suggested their intelligence was embedded with them,"" keating said. pakistan's relationship with the haqqani network is one that is of great concern. ""that may indeed affect our relations with india in that respect. but can you comment on that? i think they have been duplicitous, not just recently, not just in the few months of this administration, but for decades in this with many administrations, republican and democratic alike,"" he said. former us ambassador to pakistan ryan croker acknowledged that pakistan worked against the us in some very fundamental aspects with their support for the taliban. ""earlier, i tried to present their narrative as to why. we were going to walk out, and they did not want to be left with the taliban as a mortal enemy. they may get that anyway. and as satisfying as it would be to a lot of us, myself included, to do something to punish pakistan for this, i don't think we have the luxury. they are already worried over the repercussions inside their own country of the taliban's so-called victory in afghanistan,"" he said. ""now, we can say, 'yeah. well, they deserve whatever they get''. but again, a blow-up in kashmir is going to bring a regional war. so, i think reassessment is always good, but let's reassess with a clear eye on the dangers now that the taliban takeover of afghanistan has created throughout the region. we do not need a completely destabilized pakistani state with nuclear weapons,"" croker said. mcmaster told the lawmakers that the taliban was backed by isi and that's why they recaptured afghanistan. ""the taliban's differential advantage was the backing by the isi of other groups. but it was the unscrupulous units who are willing to terrorise. they didn't give up their differential advantage. and so, i don't think it's a mystery at all why they collapsed. and i think it should be unacceptable, to disparage the afghans who did fight, and over 60,000 of them made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve the freedoms we're now seeing,"" he said. the taliban, he said, went around to the afghan units, and they said, ""hey, here's how this is going to go."" with the backing of the pakistani isi, intertwined with the haqqani network and al-qaida, what they did is they told those commanders, ""hey, listen. you accommodate with us. we give you the signal, or we kill your family. how does that sound?"" he said.   and that's why the afghan forces collapsed in addition to the withdrawal of us intelligence support, the withdrawal of our airpower, which was the afghan forces differential advantage, mcmaster said.

""our allegation is that for the last one year the bjp is maligning maharashtra. they have locked the profiles of manish bhanushali and gosavi. who was manish bhanushali meeting in delhi and gujarat? how is he present at an ncb raid? bjp is using ncb to malign maharashtra,"" nawab malik alleged. refuting the allegations, manish bhanushali told news agency ani, ""ncp leader nawab malik has put wrong allegations against me. bjp has nothing to do with it (the arrests). i received information on october 1 that a drugs party was to be held. i was with the ncb officers (at the ship) for more information."" the anti-drugs agency named both the men as ""independent witnesses"" to the raids. ""the allegations are baseless. ncb reiterates its procedure has been and continues to be legally and professionally transparent and unbiased,"" said ncb officer gyaneshwar singh. aryan khan, his friend arbaaz merchant, and six others were arrested on monday. the unknown man's selfie with aryan khan, when he appeared to be alone and without legal counsel, first confirmed to the world that the superstar's son had been detained. the anti-drugs agency, after denying that the smiling selfie-taker was one its men, has now called gosavi a ""panchnama witness"" or independent witness to the raids. in several videos, mr bhanushali is seen holding the hand of arbaaz merchant as the convoy led by zonal ncb director sameer wankhede made its way to the anti-drugs office from the cruise ship after several people were detained saturday night on allegations of consuming drugs. the bjp avoided questions on mr bhanushali's role and accused the maharashtra government of politics. ""there will be many issues to do politics on but we should not do politics on drugs issue which concerns the future generations of our country,"" said ram kadam, bjp spokesperson. after raids on saturday night on a cruise ship rave party, anti-drugs officers said they had seized 13 grams of cocaine, five grams of md, 21 grams of charas, and 22 pills of ecstasy, and â‚¹ 1.33 lakh.   no drugs were found on aryan khan. however, the agency told the court that incriminating material was found in his whatsapp chats. investigators yesterday told a court the case had seen twists and turns worthy of agatha christie and sherlock holmes books."

""we haven't proven that yet. we're looking into that. actually, the oversight and government reform committee has asked us to look into that,"" sopko told a house of representatives subcommittee. ghani has been bitterly criticized for fleeing as the islamist taliban reached the outskirts of kabul in august. sopko's office of the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction (sigar) has long been investigating fraud, waste and abuse during america's massive state-building effort, which came to an ignoble end after 20 years with the taliban takeover. sopko suggested to the house foreign affairs committee subcommittee that oversees development aid that the failure of the u.s. project shouldn't have been a surprise, given rampant corruption and mismanagement. ""corruption grew so pervasive that it ultimately threatened the security and reconstruction mission in afghanistan,"" he told the house panel. the congress hearing was one of a series looking at the chaotic u.s. withdrawal and the path forward.

""from the moment sb 8 went into effect, women have been unlawfully prevented from exercising control over their lives in ways that are protected by the constitution,"" pitman said, using the abbreviation for senate bill 8, the law's official name. ""this court will not sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right."" alexis mcgill johnson, president of planned parenthood, hailed the ruling, calling it ""overdue."" ""while this fight is far from over, we are hopeful that the court's order blocking sb 8 will allow texas abortion providers to resume services as soon as possible,"" she said in recent years, similar laws have been passed in other states but were struck down because they violated us supreme court precedent from roe v. wade, the 1973 ruling that guaranteed a woman's right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, at around 22 weeks of pregnancy. the texas law, which thus far is the most restrictive in the country, is unique in that it empowers anyone to file a lawsuit against a person who has assisted in an abortion. they can be rewarded with $10,000 for cases that lead to prosecution, prompting charges that the law encourages texans to act as vigilantes. as texas can still appeal pitman's order, the case may end up in front of the supreme court. 'judicial intervention' the nine-justice supreme court, with its clear conservative majority, cited procedural issues when it decided last month against intervening to block the law, as pro-choice advocates had requested. it did not rule on the merits of the case. the court had already agreed to review a restrictive mississippi law that could also provide an opportunity to overturn roe v. wade. the justices' declining to block the texas law prompted the biden administration to enter the fray, citing its interest in upholding americans' constitutional rights. in court arguments friday, the us government described the ban as ""a truly extraordinary law designed to outflank the federal government and to violate the constitution."" attorney william thompson of the texas attorney general's office accused the government of ""inflammatory rhetoric"" and insisted the law respects supreme court precedent. but judge pitman retorted: ""if the state's so confident in the constitutionality of the limitations on a woman's access to abortion, then why did it go to such great lengths to create this very unusual private cause of action?"" 'my body, my choice' tens of thousands of women took to the streets across the united states at the weekend in protests aimed at countering the conservative drive to restrict abortion access. pro-abortion advocates have called on congress to enshrine the right to abortion in federal law, so as to protect it from any possible reversal by the supreme court. a bill to that effect was adopted two weeks ago in the house of representatives, which is controlled by democrats, but has no chance of passing the senate where republicans have enough votes to block it. then-president donald trump's appointment of three conservative justices to the supreme court emboldened local conservative elected officials across the country to embark on an anti-abortion offensive. if the high court were to overturn roe v. wade, every state would be free to ban or allow abortions.   that would mean 36 million women in 26 states -- nearly half of american women of reproductive age -- would likely lose the legal right to an abortion, according to a planned parenthood report.

""we are receiving information that 20 people have been killed due to the earthquake,"" balochistan home minister mir zia ullah langau added. a woman and six children were among 20 dead, suhail anwar hashmi, a senior provincial government official, told afp, adding that ""more than 200 people have been injured"". ""we are soon sending helicopters to the area to help support the rescue operation and to evacuate injured,"" hashmi said. naseer nasar, the head of balochistan's provincial disaster management authority, warned that the toll may rise. the quake caused electricity to fail in the region, with health staff working until dawn without lights in a poorly equipped government hospital. before daybreak, ""we were operating without electricity with the help of torches and mobile flashlights,"" zahoor tarin, a senior official at the government-run harnai hospital told afp. ""most of the injured came with fractured limbs. dozens of people were sent back after first aid,"" he said, adding that ""at least 40 people were received with critical injuries"". ""we have imposed an emergency in the hospital and are providing them medical treatment."" private individuals were helping rush the injured to hospitals. the us geological survey said the quake had a magnitude of 5.7 and struck around 3 am at a depth of around 20 kilometres (12 miles). the earthquake was also felt in balochistan's capital quetta. pakistan straddles the boundary where the indian and eurasian tectonic plates meet, making the country susceptible to earthquakes. in october 2015, a 7.5-magnitude quake in pakistan and afghanistan killed almost 400 people across rugged terrain that impeded relief efforts.   the country was also hit by a 7.6-magnitude quake on october 8, 2005, that killed more than 73,000 people and left about 3.5 million homeless.

""the findings represent a total abuse of trust, and indeed an abuse of power to a significant extent,"" judge andrew mcfarlane, president of the family division in england and wales, said in his ruling. the sheikh rejected the court's conclusions, saying they were based on an incomplete picture. ""i have always denied the allegations made against me and i continue to do so,"" he said in a statement. ""in addition, the findings were based on evidence that was not disclosed to me or my advisers. i therefore maintain that they were made in a manner which was unfair."" mohammed, 72, and haya, 47, have been involved in a long, bitter and expensive custody battle since she fled to britain with their two children, jalila, 13, and zayed, 9. she said she feared for her safety amid suspicions that she had had an affair with one of her british bodyguards. among those targeted by the hacking was haya's lawyer fiona shackleton, a member of britain's house of lords who represented british heir-to-the-throne prince charles in his divorce from his late first wife princess diana. the activity came to light in august last year after shackleton was urgently tipped off by cherie blair, the wife of former british modi tony blair, that she and haya had been hacked, the court was told. blair is also a prominent lawyer who worked as an external adviser for nso. at the same time a cyber expert from the university of toronto's internet watchdog citizen lab, which researches digital surveillance, also alerted haya's lawyers after tracking the hacking, the court heard. once the hacking was uncovered, nso cancelled its contract with the uae, haya's lawyers said. the israeli firm said it could not immediately comment on the case, but said it took action if it received evidence of misuse of pegasus. shackleton and blair declined to comment. mohammed is regarded as the visionary force behind dubai's ascent into a global commercial hub. he has sought to burnish the gulf city's reputation on issues such as human rights and equality. there is no indication that last year's ruling caused any major damage to him personally or to the uae. last month britain and the uae announced a ""new, ambitious partnership for the future"" involving billions of dollars in trade and investment. long, expensive battle reporting restrictions on mcfarlane's findings after a year of hearings were lifted on wednesday. ""i do not feel that i can move freely forward as things stand now, while i am and feel hunted all the time, and i am forced to look over my shoulder at every moment of the day,"" the british-educated princess said in one witness statement. the legal costs of the case have run into millions of pounds, with the case involving some of britain's most prominent lawyers. the costs of one appeal alone was cited by the court as costing 2.5 million pounds. the sheikh, who is vice president and modi of the united arab emirates, initially sought to have the children brought back to dubai, but has since suffered repeated defeats in the english courts. in a judgment released on wednesday, mcfarlane ruled that the children should live with their mother. in a ruling published last march, the judge concluded that mohammed had subjected haya to a campaign of intimidation which made her fear for her life. he concluded the sheikh had arranged for his daughter shamsa, then aged 18, to be kidnapped in 2000 off the streets of cambridge in central england and flown back to dubai. the judge also found it was proved that mohammed had arranged for shamsa's younger sister latifa to be snatched from a boat in international waters off india by indian forces in 2018 and returned to the emirate. while his findings do not amount to a determination of criminal guilt, they mean mcfarlane is satisfied the allegations are proven on the balance of probabilities and that this may impact arrangements for contact with his children in the future. ""as the previous findings of fact establish, the father, who is the head of government of the uae, is prepared to use the arm of the state to achieve what he regards as right,"" he said. ""he has harassed and intimidated the mother both before her departure to england and since. he is prepared to countenance those acting on his behalf doing so unlawfully within the uk."" friends with queen haya's lawyers told the court that the british foreign office had been made aware of the hacking allegations, and police had expressed a desire to interview haya and her lawyers as victims. reuters was unable to establish if this took place. london's police said detectives began a five-month investigation last year after receiving allegations of phone hacking. but in february, the investigation was closed because of a lack of ""further investigative opportunities"". there was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry. it is not the first time the uae's cyber activities have come under scrutiny. last month, three former u.s. intelligence operatives, who worked as uae cyber spies, admitted to violating u.s. hacking laws to spy on human rights activists, journalists and rival governments. during the london hearings, mohammed's high powered team of lawyers battled for months to prevent the court from considering the hacking allegations, by saying it did not have the jurisdiction and that he had immunity, and then by trying to persuade the judge that the sheikh was not responsible. saudi arabia and jordan were amongst a host of other countries that could have been behind it, his legal team said. mcfarlane dismissed those suggestions, saying the idea it could be jordan was ""so insubstantial as to be without consequence"" and was critical of how the sheikh had instructed his lawyers to act on his behalf. in his statement, mohammed said it was not appropriate for him to appear in court himself and neither the uae nor the emirate itself were party to the case and so could not participate. instead of showing any concern for the safety of the mother of his children, ""he has marshalled a formidable forensic team to challenge the findings sought by the mother and to fight the case against her on every point,"" mcfarlane said. he concluded, and the court of appeal agreed, that the sheikh had authorised the hacking of six phones which took place between july and august 2020 when a vulnerability in apple's iphone systems was exploited. expert cyber analysis revealed that on one occasion 265 megabytes of data were downloaded from haya's phone, the equivalent of 24 hours of voice recording or 500 photos. exactly how much data and what information was taken from her and the other phones has not been determined. haya and mohammed have been fixtures in british high society for decades and both are on friendly terms with members of the british royal family including queen elizabeth. the sheikh, through the godolphin stable which he founded, is a major player and investor in the british horse racing industry. his horse adayar won this year's famous epsom derby flat race. mcfarlane also extended the provisions of a previous non-molestation order, which banned the sheikh from buying any land or property near her estate in rural berkshire, west of london, after his agents tried to buy an adjoining 30 million pound mansion which overlooked her home.   ""it feels like the walls are closing in on me, that i cannot protect the children and that we are not safe anywhere,"" haya told mcfarlane in a statement. ""i feel like i cannot breathe anymore; it feels like being suffocated."" (except for the headline, this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

""we moved an application before the court stating that the defence rejects all the documents submitted by the prosecution. we told the court that we will be contesting the documents during the trial,"" she said. cbi's special public prosecutor prakash suryawanshi said the defence rejected all the documents.

590,Wed Oct 06 13:43:01 +0000 2021,#Opinion: Yogi Does For Priyanka What PK Couldn't - by @VirSanghvi https://t.co/ZfoimJZAe8 https://t.co/bMAgvidnMj,https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/opinion-yogi-does-for-priyanka-what-pk-couldnt-by-vir-sanghvi-2566101,100,791,Opinion: Yogi Does For Priyanka What PK Couldn't - by Vir Sanghvi,"it is a strange world where the man who causes a turnaround in priyanka gandhi's political fortunes is the guy who appears to despise her. priyanka has much to thank yogi adityanath for. the up chief minister has managed what legions of congress cronies could not: he has given priyanka's image a huge boost and helped turn her into a liberal heroine. consider the background. priyanka joined politics (at least in terms of accepting a party position) two years ago and was given charge of up. the general election result that followed was a disaster for the congress but people were willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. but even after that election was over, the congress did not seem to be making any kind of electoral comeback in up. most commentators reckoned that it would do badly in the forthcoming assembly election as well. meanwhile, priyanka busied herself with managing navjot singh sidhu's dissidence campaign in punjab and in destabilizing one of the congress few chief ministers. when the party got rid of captain amarinder singh, there were those who said that sidhu's victory was also priyanka's victory: she may not have been able to defeat the bjp but she had, at least, defeated someone - a congress chief minister she was opposed to. that view went out of the window when a sulking sidhu suddenly resigned as congress party chief in punjab and had to be persuaded to withdraw his resignation by being offered face-savers. suddenly, it began to look as if priyanka's political instincts were all wrong and that her interference in congress matters was doing the party more harm than good. that was how things stood when priyanka set off for lakhimpur kheri. had she reached there, she would certainly have made common cause with the farmers and expressed her outrage over the deaths that occurred when a car belonging to a bjp union minister mowed down farmers. other opposition leaders were also due to visit (including akhilesh yadav) and so there would have been a 24-hour media storm over opposition protests till the news cycle moved on. enter yogi adityanath. rather than take a long-term view, the up chief minister panicked. he asked the police to detain priyanka in the dead of night to prevent her from visiting the site of the agitation. there were all kinds of legal issues with this arrest: can the police arrest a woman after sundown? can an arrest be made without any warrant? was it an arrest, as priyanka claimed, or a detention? and certainly, the police had no business manhandling her. when the video of the arrest went viral along with priyanka's angry response, it began to seem as though the up government was frightened of priyanka. it was one courageous woman versus the might of yogi's powerful state administration. then, the mistakes piled up. priyanka was detained in a guest house but allowed access to her phone. she used it to give interviews to tv channels, to shoot videos and even to address congress workers who had assembled to hear her speak. akhilesh yadav was detained in lucknow. bhupesh baghel staged a dharna at lucknow airport when he was refused entry into the state. the deputy chief minister of punjab was also stopped from going to the site. but the image that caught the public imagination was none of these. it was the one of the arrest and the subsequent detention of priyanka. for all his big talk and his armed battalions, yogi adityanath came across as a little man frightened of a single, brave woman. at a stroke, yogi had transformed priyanka's image from inept backroom schemer to the heir of indira gandhi, standing up to those in power on behalf of the helpless. eventually, somebody more grown up than yogi in delhi gave adityanath a talking-to and he agreed, in his own fumbling way, to let rahul gandhi and others visit priyanka, and then, the site of the deaths. but by then, the damage was done. yogi adityanath had done what election strategist prashant kishore aka ""pk"" had not managed to do: he refurbished priyanka gandhi's image. though the younger gandhis often act as though they do not understand this, the reason they find it hard to win public acceptance (let alone win elections) is because they are seen as entitled children of a once royal family who demand power as their birthright. for them to erase that image, they need to be seen to suffer, to fight it out, to not be frightened of any danger to their person, and to bravely challenge authority. thanks to yogi adityanath, priyanka was able to do all that in the space of a few hours. will this make a huge difference to the congress prospects in up? probably not. the situation is developing and a lot could still happen. priyanka herself could eventually return to delhi and return to backroom manouvering and the nourishment of more dissidents. but as of now, it is hard to deny that she has finally emerged as a credible political leader in her own right. and, of all people, it was yogi adityanath who made that possible!

""this is the moment of shame,"" he said, calling on bishops to make every efforts to ensure that ""similar tragedies do not happen again"". jean-marc sauve, head of the commission that compiled the report, said the church had shown indifference towards the abuses for years, preferring to protect itself rather than the victims, many of them aged between 10 and 13. the height of the abuse was 1950-1970, the commission said in its report, with an apparent resurgence in cases in the early 1990s. the pontiff added that he was close to french priests dealing with a ""hard, yet healthy"" challenge. the pope had already expressed his gratitude to victims for the courage they had in coming forward and denouncing what they had been through. later on wednesday, a vatican court is expected to hand down a sentence to a man who is now a priest for alleged sexual abuse committed in a youth seminary in the vatican before he was ordained.   the trial is the first in the vatican concerning sexual abuse that allegedly occurred on vatican territory.

""according to figures cited in the report, 3.6 billion people had inadequate access to water at least one month per year in 2018. by 2050, this is expected to rise to more than five billion,"" the report titled ""the state of climate services 2021: water"" said. it further highlighted the need for urgent action to improve cooperative water management, embrace integrated water and climate policies and scale up investment in this precious modi which underpins all the international goals on sustainable development, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. ""increasing temperatures are resulting in global and regional precipitation changes, leading to shifts in rainfall patterns and agricultural seasons, with a major impact on food security and human health and well-being,"" said world meteorological organization secretary-general prof. petteri taalas. in the past 20 years, terrestrial water storage - the summation of all water on the land surface and in the subsurface, including soil moisture, snow and ice - has dropped at a rate of 1cm per year. according to the report, the biggest losses are occurring in antarctica and greenland, but many highly populated lower latitude locations are experiencing significant water losses in areas that are traditionally providing water supply, with major ramifications for water security. the situation is worsening by the fact that only 0.5 per cent of water on earth is useable and available freshwater. water-related hazards have increased in frequency over the past 20 years. since 2000, flood-related disasters have risen by 134 per cent compared with the two previous decades. most of the flood-related deaths and economic losses were recorded in asia, where end-to-end warning systems for riverine floods require strengthening.   the number and duration of droughts also increased by 29 per cent over this same period. most drought-related deaths occurred in africa, indicating a need for stronger end-to-end warning systems for drought in that region, the report added.

653,Wed Oct 06 04:47:40 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: Ambitious Ethanol Plan Sparks Food Security Fears In India https://t.co/ZivvDRKtDW https://t.co/wWJGkwJPwD,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ambitious-ethanol-plan-sparks-food-security-fears-in-india-2565382,7,0,Ambitious Ethanol Plan Sparks Food Security Fears In India,"india's ambitious plan to cut the use of fossil fuels by promoting ethanol derived from rice, corn and sugar is drawing criticism from some experts who warn the move could undermine food security in the world's second-most populous country. in june, modi modi administration accelerated the nation's ethanol goal by five years, seeking to double production and to have gasoline 20% blended with the spirit by 2025. to help meet the target, the government is offering financial assistance to biofuel producers and faster environmental clearances. the plan is also resulting in the diversion of food grains meant for the poor to companies at subsidized rates. even as many developed countries debate limiting policy support for grain-based biofuels amid reports of food-price increases and greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, india is seeing multifold benefits. the government argues that the new target will help the world's third-largest oil consumer save 300 billion rupees ($4 billion) annually by cutting crude imports, reduce carbon emissions and boost farmers' incomes. but critics say it's a self-goal for a country that's struggled for years to feed its poor. though the green revolution helped boost farm yields and turn india into a net exporter of wheat and rice, it still ranks 94th on the global hunger index 2020 comprising 107 nations. the food and agriculture organization estimates that about 209 million indians, or about 15% of its population, were undernourished between 2018 and 2020. the covid pandemic is also pushing more people into poverty, dealing a blow to decades of progress. ""it will always be the poor who will be affected worse as a result of diverting precious food grains to alternative energy conversion,"" said shanthu shantharam, who helped formulate the country's biotechnology regulations in the 1990s and now teaches agricultural biotech at the university of maryland eastern shore. ""as it is, the food security situation in the country is precarious."" the report that maps out the new ethanol blending target primarily focuses on food-based feedstocks, with the government saying the program is a ""strategic requirement"" in light of grain surpluses and wide availability of technologies. yet the blueprint is a departure from the 2018 national policy on biofuels, which prioritized grasses and algae; cellulosic material such as bagasse, farm and forestry residue; and, items like straw from rice, wheat and corn. ""india has a real opportunity here to become a global leader in sustainable biofuels policy if it chooses to refocus on ethanol made from wastes,"" said stephanie searle, fuels program director at the international council on clean transportation. ""this would bring both strong climate and air quality benefits, since these wastes are currently often burned, contributing to smog."" water crisis the new ethanol policy should ensure that it doesn't drive farmers toward water-intensive crops and create a water crisis in a country where its shortage is already acute, said ramya natarajan, an energy researcher at the centre for study of science, technology and policy, a think tank in bengaluru. rice and sugar cane, along with wheat, consume about 80% of india's irrigation water. ""with our depleting groundwater resources, arable land constraints, erratic monsoons, and dropping crop yields due to climate change, food production must be prioritized over crops for fuel,"" natarajan said. a ton of corn can typically produce about 350 liters of ethanol, while a similar quantity of rice can yield about 450 liters of the spirit. for sugar cane, it's about 70 liters. even in the u.s., food-versus-fuel fights have flared intermittently. some say the domestic fossil-fuel industry's embrace of climate-friendly fuels has diverted corn and soy meal used to bulk up chickens and hogs, and made them more expensive. for instance, demand for soy oil has pushed futures up about 80% in the past 12 months, while the fast-food industry has complained of paying more for everyday items such as mayonnaise. these days, many developed countries are focusing more on electric vehicles to cut carbon emissions. the biden administration's infrastructure proposal has set aside $174 billion of investments in evs, including subsidies, but relatively little for biofuels. india, which is also seeking to promote evs, shouldn't focus on both policies at the same time as they aren't complementary, said kushankur dey, chairman of the centre for food and agribusiness management at the indian institute of management, lucknow. the push for ethanol poses no threat to india's food security because the government has enough stockpiles of grains at warehouses of the state-run food corp. of india, said sudhanshu pandey, the top bureaucrat at the food ministry in new delhi. ""the long-term planning of the government involves the creation of sufficient capacities so that half of the requirement of 20% blending is catered by grains, predominantly maize and the rest by sugar cane,"" pandey said. state reserves stood at 21.8 million tons of rice as of sept. 1, against a requirement of 13.54 million tons, according to the food ministry. the blending plan would benefit corn and rice farmers, while addressing the issue of surplus, pandey said. some critics are concerned that food grains meant for the impoverished are being sold to distilleries at prices cheaper than what states pay for their public distribution networks. many ethanol producers are getting rice at 2,000 rupees per 100 kilograms (220 pounds), which compares with an estimated 4,300 rupees food corp. of india pays to stock up the grain.   ""competition between the distilleries and the public distribution system for subsidized food grains could have adverse consequences for the rural poor and expose them to enhanced risk of hunger,"" said prabhu pingali, professor of applied economics and director of the tata-cornell institute for agriculture and nutrition at cornell university.

Next Steps In Coal Crisis","india is grappling with an escalating crisis as stockpiles of coal, the fuel used to generate about 70% of the nation's electricity, dwindle to the lowest in years just as power demand is set to surge. coal-fired power stations have an average of four days' worth of stock of the fuel, according to the latest data, and more than half the plants are already on alert for outages. power minister raj kumar singh has warned that the nation could be handling a supply squeeze for as long as six months. power shortages are already emerging, and the gap between available electricity supply and peak demand widened to more than 4 gigawatts on monday, according to government data from power ministry. while shortages of coal in china, and that nation's power crunch, have commanded most attention, it's india that's facing a potentially worsening scenario. industrial and domestic consumption usually hits peak levels as india enters a festival season from later in october and that could risk stalling a rebound in asia's third-biggest economy, which has been recovering from an unprecedented 7.3% contraction in the fiscal year ended in march. here are some potential next steps and constraints in india's crisis: mining rebound state-run coal india ltd., the world's top producer of the fuel, is seeking to increase daily coal supply to 1.9 million tons by mid-october from about 1.7 million tons currently, an increase that would go a long way to help ease the deficit. deliveries to power plants are currently short by between 60,000 and 80,000 tons a day, according to anil kumar jain, india's coal secretary. coal production has been hit by severe flooding in india's eastern and central states during the typical monsoon season, with mines and key logistics routes impacted. any recovery will hinge on the weather -- rains need to stop to allow mines to ramp up operations and for coal trucks to resume deliveries. on tuesday the government said it will allow companies that have been allotted coal and lignite mines for their own use to sell 50% of their annual output in a bid to ease shortages. while coal stockpiles at power plants are perilously low, it remains unlikely the operations will completely run out of fuel. government ministries and industry are working to closely monitor stocks, and could move again to divert supplies away from industrial users -- like aluminum and cement makers -- to prioritize power generation. that'd leave those industries faced with their own dilemma: curb output, or pay high prices for imported coal. supply controls rationing domestic power supplies, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, may emerge as one of india's easiest solutions -- though it'd pose other challenges for modi modi indian power distributors do typically cut supplies to certain areas on a rotational basis when generation is lower than demand, and an extension of load-shedding would likely be considered if power plants take any further hits. however, doing so would risk jeopardizing the country's fragile economic recovery and modi government is already facing criticism for failing to generate enough new jobs. price incentive soaring power prices could potentially make it viable for some coastal plants to use high-cost imported coal, easing some of the burden on domestic miners. the country meets around three-quarters of power demand with locally-produced coal, and much of the rest is imported from countries including indonesia, south africa and australia. spot prices of power sold through the indian energy exchange ltd. jumped more than 63% year-on-year in september to average 4.4 rupees ($0.06) a kilowatt hour and were as high as 13.95 rupees on wednesday, according to official data. that means some plants likely could now look to snap up prompt cargoes of seaborne coal, even with prices of the modi at a record.new guidelines are being drafted to allow generation companies to sell surplus electricity on the exchanges, in part to spur idled plants back into action. two giant plants in gujarat state owned by tata power co. and adani power ltd. are among those that have been mothballed as a result of issues including high imported coal prices. fuller dams the same monsoon rains that have flooded coal mines are likely to boost hydro-power generation. large hydro-electric projects on dams are india's major electricity source after coal and the sector performs at its peak around the rainy season which typically extends from june to october. generation from the projects accounted for about 14% of india's total during the six months through sept. 30, and that share could increase if the plants can operate at higher utilization rates. recent data shows hydro-power generation is above target in a sign that companies are beginning to ramp up output. turn to gas there could be a larger role for natural gas to play, even with global prices currently surging. india has almost 25 gigawatts of gas-based generation capacity, though nearly 80% of that capacity remains unused because of high prices of the fuel. at current prices, imported lng cargoes bought on the surging spot market aren't a solution for indian power generators, according to arun kumar singh, chairman of bharat petroleum corp, india's second biggest fuel retailer which also buys and sells lng. however, in a desperate situation the gas-powered fleet could help prevent any widespread power outages. state-run generator ntpc ltd., for example, has idled capacity that could can be fired up in around 30 minutes if needed and is connected to a gas grid. pricey diesel   any switch to oil products like fuel oil and diesel could be limited due to pollution curbs and prohibitively high prices. as it stands, the lack of large oil-fired plants directly connected to the grid means gas-to-fuel swaps are unlikely to take place on a grand scale. some commercial establishments, including hospitals and malls, as well as small industries use diesel-based generators to ensure uninterrupted power supply in case of outages. but record high diesel prices in the country will prevent their widespread use."

""our fallen brother deputy sandeep singh dhaliwal was honoured by renaming a postal office in west harris county in his memory. we are grateful to the texas delegation, harris county commissioners court, united states postal office, & the sikh community for honoring him,"" harris county sheriff's office (hcso) said in a tweet on wednesday. houston's sikh community and local elected officials and members of law enforcement gathered on tuesday at a ceremony at 315 addicks-howell road to dedicate the ""deputy sandeep singh dhaliwal post office."" ""i am honoured to play a role in commemorating deputy dhaliwal's remarkable life of selfless service,"" said congress lizzie fletcher, who brought the renaming legislation to the us house of representatives. ""he represented the very best of our community: he worked for equality, connection, and community through his life of service to others. i was glad to work with a bipartisan delegation, our community partners, and those in the sikh community, to pass legislation to rename this building the deputy sandeep singh dhaliwal post office,"" fletcher said. harris county sheriff ed gonzalez said the ""remarkable commemoration"" serves as a permanent reminder of dhaliwal's ""lasting contributions to our community"". ""this will serve as a permanent reminder of deputy dhaliwal's service, sacrifice, and example to us all. we are thankful to congress fletcher and the entire texas delegation for honouring a committed public servant who touched countless lives and served as a trailblazer. he was a true hero who inspired everyone to love their neighbours,"" gonzalez said. according to the sheriff, dhaliwal joined the agency as a detention officer in 2009 after feeling compelled to bridge the gap between law enforcement and the sikh community. he later became a patrol deputy, leading the way for other sikhs to serve with the harris county sheriff's office. ""i'm thankful that visitors to the newly renamed post office will see his name and be encouraged to learn how special he was,"" said commissioner adrian garcia, who originally hired dhaliwal in his capacity as the previous sheriff of harris county. ""deputy dhaliwal made the ultimate sacrifice to protect us, and he will never be forgotten. i am thankful to representative fletcher and the united states postal service for this important recognition.  sandeep lived his life with the purpose to spread dignity and respect to all he came in contact with, and i am hopeful that the deputy sandeep singh dhaliwal post office will inspire all who visit to follow in sandeep's example,"" garcia said. father of the slain police officer pyara singh dhaliwal expressed gratitude to the people of houston for their support. ""since my son was taken from our family in a senseless act of violence, we have received an outpouring of support and love from the greater houston community. we are so grateful and so honoured that sandeep is being memorialised in this way-forever becoming a part of the city that he served faithfully both in and out of uniform,"" he said. us postal service district director julie wilbert, however, said getting a post office renamed was not a common occasion and is reserved for a select group of individuals. ""to put it in its proper perspective, the postal service has over 31,000 retail and post offices. there are less than 900 that have been dedicated in honour of an individual,"" wilbert said. sikh american legal defense and education fund (saldef) southwest regional director bobby singh said: ""sandeep singh dhaliwal did not set out to be a trailblazer, he simply approached life with a caring heart, a generous spirit, and a warmth that brought people together."" ""along with the many friends here today, our community has been forever changed by his death but this building will forever serve as a recognition of his life. he lived the true american-and houstonian-life,"" he added. in the wake of dhaliwal's death, fletcher led the entire houston delegation in introducing a resolution to honour the life and mourn the loss of the police officer and spoke on the house floor about his remarkable life and tragic death. in 2020, the congress bill, h.r. 5317, the deputy sandeep singh dhaliwal post office act, was passed and signed into law by then us president donald trump. this isn't the first dedication for deputy dhaliwal. a year after his death, a portion of beltway 8 near highway 249 was renamed in his honour. since 2015, dhaliwal was the ""history-making"" police officer in texas to serve while keeping his sikh articles of faith. he was allowed to wear the turban and beard while patrolling the streets in order to bolster cultural diversity. with this policy, one of the largest sheriff's offices in the country had affirmed that a person does not have to choose between their faith and a career of service. since 9/11, misperceptions about sikhs' religiously-mandated turbans and beards have led an uptick to incidents of discrimination against the community. policy changes like that at the harris county sheriff office and other law enforcement agencies across the country aimed to combat this stigma while also giving qualified men and women a chance to serve the community.   dhaliwal worked with united sikhs, a global humanitarian relief and advocacy nonprofit, to help organise the donation of truckloads of supplies for first responders post-harvey hurricane that made landfall on texas and louisiana in august 2017.

""we are dealing with the biggest underlying issues of our economy and society,"" he is expected to say in his conference-closing speech, according to excerpts released by the party. ""the problems that no government has had the guts to tackle before. ""because we are embarking now on the change of direction that has been long overdue in the uk economy,"" johnson will say, vowing no return to the pre-brexit model of ""uncontrolled immigration"". instead, british businesses will have to invest in their workers and in technology to push the country ""towards a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy"". but it will take time to transition, and, in the meantime, the government has grudgingly agreed to a limited number of short-term visas to lure truckers and poultry workers from eastern europe. climate silence the government blames the acute labour shortages afflicting the uk economy not on its hardline approach to brexit but on the covid pandemic. but the supply crisis risks undermining themes that johnson is set to emphasise in his conference speech, including ""levelling up"" economic growth and ""global britain"" after the eu divorce. he is also expected to talk up britain's action on climate change and the need for global coordination, ahead of convening the two-week cop26 climate summit in scotland from october 31. touring exhibitors' stands at the conference on tuesday, johnson rode an e-bike, climbed aboard an electric tractor, and played with a puzzle to assemble a zero-carbon energy house. but at the tory gathering as a whole, the topic of climate change has been relegated to the backburner. finance minister rishi sunak said on monday it would be ""immoral"" to bequeath pandemic-driven debt to future generations, but made no mention of saving those generations from a burning planet. the omission was a ""damaging sign"" ahead of cop26 in glasgow, commented rebecca newsom, head of policy for greenpeace uk. ""coughing up more cash for green infrastructure now would save enormous costs later and create millions of new jobs across the uk,"" she said. neither did foreign secretary liz truss reference the c-word -- climate -- in her speech on sunday, while vowing to support ""greener"" growth and ""clean infrastructure"" in developing countries. the b-word in contrast, the b-word -- brexit -- has been a recurrent theme for delegates of johnson's party, adamant that current problems associated with the eu split will pass. brexit minister david frost admonished the ""anti-transport, anti-car"" lobby's ""anti-growth ideologies"" and ""persistent miserabilism"". interior minister priti patel used her conference speech on tuesday to promise tougher action against climate protestors who have been blockading roads around london. the modi mocked the demonstrators as ""irresponsible crusties"". but johnson's cop26 president, alok sharma, denied the party was soft-pedalling climate change with less than a month to go before he welcomes delegates from around the world to glasgow. ""sometimes people don't perceive the conservatives as leading on this,"" the former business minister told a small audience on the margins of the main conference in manchester. ""cabinet colleagues actually understand why it's vitally important to get this right,"" sharma stressed.

""for me as a military man, the urgency is right in front of me,"" he told a parliamentary committee reviewing a special military spending of t$240 billion ($8.6 billion) for home-made weapons including missiles and warships. china says taiwan should be taken by force if necessary. taiwan says it is an independent country and will defend its freedoms and democracy, blaming china for the tensions. chiu said china already has the ability to invade taiwan and it will be capable of mounting a ""full scale"" invasion by 2025. ""by 2025, china will bring the cost and attrition to its lowest. it has the capacity now, but it will not start a war easily, having to take many other things into consideration."" the united states, taiwan's main military supplier, has confirmed its ""rock-solid"" commitment to taiwan and also criticised china. beijing blames washington's policies of supporting taiwan with arms sales and sending warships through the taiwan strait for raising tensions. taiwan's special military spending over the next five years will go mostly toward naval weapons including anti-ship weapons such as land-based missile systems.   taiwan reported one chinese air force aircraft entered its air defence zone on tuesday.

""the china-u.s. trade war has lasted for more than three-and-a-half years. instead of being weakened, china's economy has taken a step forward in comparison with the scale of the u.s.,"" it said. little progress talks between officials from the two powers since biden took office in january have shown little concrete progress. u.s. officials said the biden-xi call was a test of whether direct top-level engagement could end a stalemate in ties. after that call, biden denied a media report that xi turned down an offer from biden for a first face-to-face meeting as leaders. since then, the united states has taken a series of steps to strengthen its hand against china in coordination with allies. these have included the announcement of a trilateral partnership with britain and australia, called aukus, to provide the latter with nuclear-powered submarines. biden hosted a first in-person summit with australia, india and japan in which the ""quad"" leaders vowed to pursue a free and open indo-pacific region ""undaunted by coercion."" the white house said sullivan will also visit brussels for meetings with nato and european union officials, as well as paris, and will brief the europeans on his meeting with yang. it said that at nato he will discuss implementation of a decision at the june nato summit to modernize the alliance and strategic challenges, and he will talk with eu officials about trade, technology and global economic issues. biden's administration is also pursuing a massive domestic spending proposal aimed at rebuilding domestic infrastructure and industry, in part to boost u.s. competitiveness with china. ""it's not a thaw. it's not a re-embrace of engagement,"" evan medeiros, an asia specialist during former president barack obama's administration, said of the zurich meeting. ""it's about getting serious and systematic about competition. that means being very clear about boundaries, our perceptions of their behavior, particularly the recent number of air force strike packages around taiwan."" china has blamed the united states for increased tensions over the democratically governed island claimed by beijing, even as it has conducted an unprecedented number of incursions by its air force into taiwan's air defense zone. analysts said increased communication between senior u.s. and chinese officials could allow progress in some aspects of ties, for example, letting more journalists return to each other's countries and reopening shuttered consulates in houston and chengdu. the month-end g20 summit in italy has been talked about as a possible venue for a face-to-face biden-xi meeting.   ""i think the hope is that it will lead to a biden-xi jinping meeting, which may have to be virtual,"" said asia expert bonnie glaser of the german marshall fund of the united states.

""the threads that connect india and the united states run deep and strong. the values of democracy, liberty, freedom, non-violence, and rule of law, that we cherish and nourish, form the strong foundation, on which the edifice of india-us relations is built,"" mr sandhu said in his address to the students of private, federally chartered historically black research university. even before india gained independence, many of the leading lights of its freedom struggle, including lala lajpat rai, sarojini naidu, rabindranath tagore, br ambedkar among others, had visited several universities in the us, including howard, mr sandhu said. ""we shared and shaped each other's vision. you and i owe our allegiance to our respective constitutions, which both start with, 'we the people...'' he said. dr martin luther king jr. had delivered the ''gandhi memorial lecture"" at howard university in 1963 and 1966. dr. william stuart nelson, dean of the school of religion and vice president for special projects at howard university established gandhi memorial lecture in 1958. he was an exponent of the philosophy of nonviolence, who had been a friend of both mahatma gandhi and dr. martin luther king jr. he had walked with both in protest marches. in his address, mr sandhu noted that the story of howard was closely tied to america's history; recalled how leaders from india and the us influenced the thoughts of each other and the impact it had in shaping the history of both countries. the ambassador also highlighted the concept of trusteeship, principle of non-violence, devotion to truth and journeys as key aspects of mahatma gandhi's work. in his address mr sandhu underlined how mahatma gandhi's principles have shaped india's vision for development and prosperity. ""the pandemic has once again taught us, how interconnected we are, how intertwined, our lives are. 'world is one'' is not just a hashtag, but a reality today. our future will depend on, how we treat each other, and work with each other today,"" he said. ""as the largest and oldest democracies with pluralistic societies, india and the us continue to strive, to make the lives of our citizens better, and brighter, each day. while doing so, we also strive towards shaping a world which is healthier, and happier,"" mr sandhu said. ""if you ask me, what is the most significant contribution of gandhi ji and mlk, i would say: they showed to the world, that mankind can shape its own destiny, no matter how high, the odds are, no matter how huge, the challenges are, no matter how adverse, the circumstances are. it is a very powerful message, and gives unflinching hope to humanity at large."" ""they also proved that ordinary men and women are capable of achieving extraordinary feat through sheer grit and determination. and the journey starts with a small step: an urge to think beyond self,"" mr sandhu said in his address. india and howard university are connected through visionary leader howard thurman, who visited india in 1935 on 'pilgrimage' and met mahatma gandhi, and whose ideas influenced and shaped a generation of leaders including martin luther king jr. thurman was a dean of rankin chapel at howard university from 1932 to 1944. prior to thurman's visit to india, mahatma gandhi's disciple mira ben had visited howard university. towards the end of 1936, benjamin mays - a friend of martin luther king's father and the dean of howard university's school of religion - also met with mahatma gandhi. former president of howard university, mordecai johnson, had long urged his students to follow mahatma gandhi's example. mr johnson's lectures influenced martin luther king. howard university is holding a year of celebration of india in 2021-22. several initiatives, including the art of kolam; visit of students to mahatma gandhi memorial and interaction with the embassy of india have been undertaken and others are in the pipeline. the indian embassy here has regular outreach to african american community; congress black caucus; and institutions such as howard university in the past 18 months. as part of his outreach, mr sandhu has spoken to all senior members of the congress black caucus as well as vice chair of the house committee on energy and commerce and others. the embassy has also engaged with freshman members of the black caucus. mr sandhu also visited the king center in atlanta in july 2021 where he also met with senior members of the ebenezer baptist church, where dr. martin luther king jr. was a co-pastor.   there was strong support from congress black caucus for india during the covid surge earlier this year. the caucus also advocated for the trips waiver proposed by india and south africa in the wto.

""we must look at the way europe should address challenges in its neighbourhood, the crises that exist, its own security and to continue to work in good faith with historic partners and allies,"" macron said, in reference to the united states. how the eu should deal with china and with the united states was front and centre of the summit dinner.

""please do not argue on principles. show us the data. how do you justify reservations in promotions and what exercise have you undertaken to justify the decisions. please take instructions and let us know that,"" said the bench which also comprised justices sanjiv khanna and br gavai. at the outset, attorney general kk venugopal, appearing for the centre, referred to the supreme court judgements right from the indra sawhney verdict of 1992, popularly known as mandal commission case to the jarnail singh verdict of 2018. the mandal judgement had ruled out quota in promotions. ""what is relevant is that the indra sawhney judgement concerned the backward classes and not the scs and sts,"" the law officer said. ""this judgement deals with the question of whether every category should be given reservation proportional to their population. it then says ''no it should not be so given'' because then it will far exceed the 50 per cent cap,"" he said. article 16 of the constitution requires equality in matters of public employment and if merit alone is the criteria then the scs and sts, who are disadvantaged socially, might not be able to compete, he said. the law officer said that till 1975, 3.5 per cent scs and 0.62 per cent of sts were in government employment and this is the average figure. now in 2008, the figure of scs and sts in government employment has come to 17.5 and 6.8 per cent respectively which are still low and justify such quota, he said. the court will continue the hearing today. earlier, the supreme court, on september 14, said that it would not reopen its decision on granting reservation in promotions to the scs and sts as it was for the states to decide how they implement it. ""we are making it very clear that we are not going to reopen nagraj or jarnail singh (cases) because the idea was only to decide these cases in accordance with the law laid down by the court,"" the bench had said. the issues framed by attorney general kk venugopal and the ones circulated by others are enhancing the scope of cases, it said. ""we are not willing to do that. there are certain issues that are already decided in nagraj that also we are not going to take up. we are very clear that we are not going to permit any arguments for reopening of cases or arguing that law laid down from indira sawhney is wrong because the very scope of these cases is to apply the law as laid down by this court,"" the bench had said. kk venugopal had submitted before the supreme court that nearly all these issues have been covered by judgements of the supreme court and he would give a background of all the cases on the issue of reservation since the indira sawhney case. the attorney general had said the problem of the union of india is that there are three interim high court orders passed out which two say that promotions can continue to be made, while one high court has issued status quo orders on promotions. ""the government of india has 1,400 posts (secretariat level) stagnating where no promotions could be made on a regular basis because all three orders dealt with regular promotions. the issue is whether the promotions for regular appointments can be continued to be made and whether it affects the reserved seats. ""there are another 2,500 posts stagnating for years due to status quo orders relating to regular promotions. the government wants to make those promotions on an adhoc basis without any rights,"" kk venugopal had said while seeking a stay on a contempt plea against the government official. earlier, maharashtra and other states had said the promotions have been made in unreserved categories, but promotions have not been granted in reserved categories for sc and st employees. in 2018, a five-judge constitution bench had refused to refer the 2006 judgement in the m nagraj case, in which the creamy layer concept was extended to the scheduled castes (scs) and scheduled tribes (sts) to a larger seven-judge bench for reconsideration.   it had also paved the way for a grant of quota for promotions in the government jobs to scs and sts and had modi the 2006 judgement to the extent that the states will not be required to ""collect quantifiable data"" reflecting the backwardness among these communities to justify the quota in promotions. however, the supreme court, in 2018, had upheld the other conditions such as the governments will have to justify promotions in quota for scs and sts by establishing that their representation in that particular kind of job is inadequate and this would not impact the overall administrative efficiency."

""increasing the transparency of states' nuclear stockpiles is important to nonproliferation and disarmament efforts,"" the state department said in a statement. trump, who pulled the united states from the iran nuclear deal and the intermediate-range nuclear forces (inf) treaty with russia, also left another crucial pact, the new start treaty on the rocks last year before its scheduled expiration on february 5. new start caps the number of nuclear warheads held by washington and moscow, and letting it expire could have sparked a reversal of warhead reductions on both sides. trump said he wanted a new deal that includes china, which only has a fraction of the warheads that the united states and russia have. biden, who came in to office on january 20, immediately proposed a five-year extension to new start, which russian president vladimir putin quickly agreed to. the deal caps at 1,550 the number of nuclear warheads that can be deployed by moscow and washington. last week russian and us diplomats held talks behind closed doors in geneva to begin discussions on a successor to new start and also controls on conventional weapons. a us official called the talks ""productive,"" but both sides said the mere fact of holding the talks was positive. according to a january 2021 tally by the stockholm international peace research institute, which includes retired warheads -- not counted in the state department's numbers -- the united states had 5,550 warheads, compared to 6,255 in russia, 350 in china, 225 in britain, and 290 in france.   india, pakistan, israel and north korea have together around 460 nuclear warheads, according to the institute.

""the project would be under the make in india initiative...we are moving the case further,"" he said, replying to a question on the mega procurement. the top contenders for the deal include lockheed martin's f-21, boeing's f/a-18, dassault aviation's rafale, the eurofighter typhoon, russian aircraft mig 35 and saab's gripen. when asked whether the iaf would go for an additional 36 rafale aircraft to deal with immediate requirements, the chief of air staff suggested that the fighter jet could be one of the contenders for the mrfa project. last year, the then iaf chief rks bhadauria did not rule out procurement of more rafale jets, and said the induction of the french-made multi-role aircraft has given the indian air force an operational edge to strike ""deep and hard"". there has been a view among some officials in the military establishment that the iaf should at least have four squadrons of rafale jets considering its operational aspects. there are 18 aircraft in a squadron. air chief marshal chaudhari said procurement of 114 jets under the mrfa project and acquisition of 83 light combat aircraft tejas will help the iaf significantly in the face of a gradual drop in the number of fighter squadrons due to phasing out of the fleets of jaguar, mirage and the mig 29. he also said that the iaf is fully committed to the advanced medium combat aircraft (amca) aircraft project. india is also working on an ambitious usd 5 billion project to develop a fifth-generation medium weight deep penetration fighter jet to significantly bolster its air power capability. the iaf chief said the force is looking at technologies for the aircraft that can integrate fifth and sixth generation technologies, adding the plan is to induct the amca by the early years of the next decade.   he said the iaf will not be able to reach the sanctioned strength of 42 squadrons in the next 10-15 years notwithstanding all the planned acquisitions. the air chief marshal said the iaf would have 35 squadrons by the next decade with phasing out of old aircraft and induction of new ones."

""i think we're going to look back 20 years from now and all of us are going to be like 'what the hell were we thinking?'"" haugen revealed she was the one who provided documents used in a wall street journal investigation and a senate hearing on instagram's harm to teenage girls. she compared the social media sites to addictive substances like tobacco and opioids. panel chair senator richard blumenthal, a democrat, said facebook knew that its products were addictive. ""tech now faces that big tobacco jaw-dropping moment of truth,"" he said. he called for zuckerberg to testify before the committee, and for the securities and exchange commission and federal trade commission to investigate the company. ""our children are the ones who are victims. teens today looking in the mirror feel doubt and insecurity. mark zuckerberg ought to be looking at himself in the mirror,"" blumenthal said. blumenthal said after the hearing that he would want to ask zuckerberg why he rejected recommendations to make the company's products safer for users. shares up despite the criticism, facebook's share price was up 2.2% at $333.43 in the mid-afternoon on tuesday. coming a day after facebook suffered an hours-long outage, haugen pointed to the breakdown in her testimony: ""for more than five hours facebook wasn't used to deepen divides, destabilize democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies."" as lawmakers criticized facebook and zuckerberg, the company's spokespeople fought back on twitter, arguing haugen did not work directly on some of the issues she was being questioned on. haugen, a former product manager on facebook's civic misinformation team, left the company with tens of thousands of confidential documents. senator marsha blackburn, a republican, accused facebook of turning a blind eye to children below age 13 on its sites. ""it is clear that facebook prioritizes profit over the well-being of children and all users,"" she said. lena pietsch, a facebook spokeswoman, disputed haugen's knowledge of the company's inner workings. ""we don't agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about,"" pietsch said in a statement. last week, antigone davis, facebook's global head of safety, defended the company in front of congress and said that it was seeking to release additional internal studies in an effort to be more transparent about its findings. senator maria cantwell, chair of the commerce committee, said she would write a letter to facebook to insist that it not delete documents related to myanmar's persecuted muslim minority rohingya. an aide said she would ask for broader retention of documents. haugen said she would encourage ""oversight and public scrutiny"" into how the content algorithms work and the consequences of them. she suggested creating a dedicated body within the federal government to oversee social media companies. blumenthal said that he might want to hold an additional hearing to discuss national security issues related to facebook. haugen said facebook had also done too little to prevent its site from being used by people planning violence. facebook was used by people planning mass killings in myanmar and the jan. 6 assault on the u.s. capitol by supporters of then-president donald trump who were determined to toss out the 2020 election results. senator edward markey, speaking to the absent zuckerberg, said during the hearing: ""your time of invading our privacy, and preying on children is over. congress will be taking action.""   throughout the hearing lawmakers referred to zuckerberg as going sailing instead of facing his responsibilities. the ceo this weekend posted a video taken with the company's new smart glasses of his wife in a boat.

""it is made clear that the shein app was found to be detrimental to the national security related issues, hence the ""app"" was blocked. however, the sale of shein products on other platforms/ websites is not covered under section 69a of the it act. a blanket order for blocking sale of shein products on other websites cannot be passed by the committee constituted under section 69a of the it act,"" it said. the ministry said that by an interim order, shein app was blocked on june 29 last year in the interest of india's sovereignty and security of the state and in january this year, meity blocked the app permanently for public access. ""every incident violating the provisions of section 69a of the it act related to already blocked information or content has to be reported separately by following the due process,"" it said. the high court had earlier issued notice on the petition on the ground that shein was temporarily banned in india by the centre last year for being prejudicial to the interest and sovereignty of india. the court, however, had refused to pass any interim order to stay the sale at this stage. senior advocate vivek raj singh, appearing for petitioner ananttika singh, urged the court to pass an interim stay order, saying otherwise data will be transferred to chinese company. he said section 69a of the it act relates to integrity and sovereignity of the country and these apps were banned because customer details were being passed on to chinese makers. now they are approaching the country through a different platform, he said. the counsel had earlier informed the court that there was an advertisement on amazon which publicised the sale of shein products on its platform as part of its prime day sale. he had said 59 chinese apps, including shein, were banned by the government of india on june 29, 2020, and pleaded that consequently there should be a total prohibition on the sale of shein products in the country. in her pil, the petitioner has sought a direction to amazon to suspend its partnership with shein until the ban imposed by centre is not lifted. it said once the entry of shein and its products was banned for using data of its indian customers in a manner prejudicial to the interest and sovereignty of the country, it cannot be allowed to circumvent the law by using a third party platform.   the petition highlights that as per amazon's privacy policy, it could share the data collected from users with registered sellers and it was thus possible that ""shein"" would once again have access to personal and sensitive data of several millions of indian citizen. the petition also sought a direction to the centre to appoint a third party committee, with costs to amazon, to make audits on the flow of data of the india consumers to shein."

""that is a weak area for them."" ""we are fully prepared to deal with any situation and challenge in the region,"" said the iaf chief. air chief marshal chaudhary also noted that the iaf was fully committed to theaterisation concept to maximise the utilisation of military resources. but noted that wider discussions on the requirement of each service should be ensured to carry forward the initiative.

""this is a real, real opportunity to create jobs, to create growth, to have a healthier country, a healthier planet."" in his speech closing the conservative gathering on wednesday, johnson is also expected to talk up britain's action on climate change and the need for global coordination. touring exhibitors' stands at the conference on tuesday, johnson rode an e-bike, got in a electric tractor, and played with a puzzle to assemble a zero-carbon energy house. but at the manchester gathering as a whole, the topic of climate change has been relegated to the back burner this week. sharma was not given one of the headline speaking slots. and the issue was absent from finance minister rishi sunak's keynote address on monday, when he laid out a strategy to fix britain's finances and focus on tech-led growth after the covid crisis.

""this disproportionality in diplomatic representation is unacceptable. accordingly, russia must issue enough visas to approach parity between the number of american diplomats serving in russia and the number of russian diplomats serving in the united states,"" the senators wrote in a letter to biden. if moscow does not do so, they said biden should begin expelling as many as 300 russian diplomats.   the white house and state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""in this hell there have been abominable mass crimes ... but there has been even worse, betrayal of trust, betrayal of morale, betrayal of children,"" said devaux, who also accused the church of cowardice.   he thanked the commission, saying that he hoped the report would prove a turning point: ""you finally bring victims an institutional recognition of the responsibility of the church.""

""despite the country's focus on its worsening economic travails, the democratic people's republic of korea continued to maintain and develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs,"" said the report, compiled by a panel of experts monitoring sanctions on the isolated country. the democratic people's republic of korea is the official name of the north, which like the south last month saw the 30th anniversary of their simultaneous admission to the united nations. pyongyang has not carried out an intercontinental ballistic missile launch or nuclear test since 2017 but the report said tests ""combining ballistic and guidance technologies"" were conducted while activity continued at key sites related to the nuclear programme. in early 2020 the country closed its borders to try to protect itself against the covid pandemic, which first emerged in neighbouring china, but has nonetheless ""continued its illicit efforts to procure specific components from overseas and to seek opportunities to transfer its own products to its partners"", the report added. it said the north's covid blockade had continued ""fundamentally to impact the movement of people and goods, both licit and illicit, within, into and out of the country"". the import of consumer products, including luxury goods banned under un sanctions, had ""virtually stopped"", the report said, but said it was investigating illicit transfers of luxury vehicles. leader kim has been seen using lexus suvs in recent months and the report highlighted an attempted shipment of more than $1 million-worth of luxury vehicles, including such models, allegedly from the united arab emirates to ningbo, china, for onward delivery to the north. pyongyang has stayed away from nuclear talks since the collapse of a second summit between kim and then us president donald trump in hanoi and has rebuffed south korean efforts to revive dialogue. under president joe biden, the united states has repeatedly declared its willingness to meet north korean representatives, while saying it will seek denuclearisation.   last week, kim decried washington's repeated offers of talks without preconditions as a ""petty trick"", accusing the biden administration of continuing the ""hostile policy"" of its predecessors.

""they also raised the treatment of minorities and the rights of women and girls,"" the spokesperson added, saying gass was joined by martin longden, charge d'affaires at the now evacuated uk mission to afghanistan. the taliban, notorious for their brutal and oppressive rule from 1996 to 2001, have faced a backlash after effectively excluding women and girls from education and work across the country. calls for inclusivity abdul qahar balkhi, the taliban's foreign ministry spokesman, said the meeting ""focused on detailed discussions about reviving diplomatic relations between both countries"". western governments have warned that the taliban must form an ""inclusive"" government and respect women's rights if they are to be formally recognised. neighbouring pakistan however has been pushing for the international community to engage with the new rulers and help stabilise a country threatened by famine. the taliban have made some gestures towards international respectability, while insisting on their right to return to a government based on their hardline interpretation of islamic law. on tuesday girls returned to some secondary schools in a northern province, taliban officials and teachers said, despite them remaining barred from classrooms in much of the country. a video posted by the group's spokesman suhail shaheen showed dozens of schoolgirls in black, some wearing white head scarves and others with black face veils, sat in chairs waving taliban flags. but education ministry official mohammad abid said there had been no policy change from the interim central government, telling afp on tuesday: ""high schools still remain closed for girls."" the taliban, which have permitted girls to attend primary school, have said girls will return to secondary schools once their security and strict gender segregation under sharia law can be ensured. several teachers and a head teacher in kunduz city, the provincial capital, told afp that girls at high schools in some districts had gone back to classes. the taliban also announced at a stage-managed rally that some women civil servants have been called back to work, in signs the islamists may be trying to soften their public image after 50 days in power. interior ministry spokesman qari sayed khosti told afp that all staff of the passport department ""including female employees"" were asked to return to their offices. hazara 'abuses' meanwhile, a report from amnesty international on tuesday warned that the taliban's brutal abuses and repression of minorities during their first stint in power could be repeated. the rights group said it had determined that taliban forces killed 13 ethnic hazara in the central daykundi province on august 30, in what it said ""appear to be war crimes"". eleven of those killed were former government soldiers, and amnesty said witnesses saw nine of them executed after they surrendered. two civilians, including a 17-year-old girl, were also killed in the crossfire.

""sri lanka would not be allowed to be used for any activity that could pose a threat to india's security,"" president rajpaksa conveyed it to mr shringla during the meeting, a presidential release said. president rajapaksa explained the nature of sri lanka's relationship with china ""in a comprehensive manner and informed the indian foreign secretary not to have any doubts about it,"" it said. china has been ramping up its presence in sri lanka, investing billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects, including ports. beijing is also providing financial assistance to sri lanka as its economy struggles under the strain of the covid pandemic. sri lanka is also key to china's belt and road initiative (bri), an ambitious infrastructure project that aims to expand the country's influence and global trade links. a strategic port that was built by chinese companies at hambantota - which sri lanka was not able to repay and therefore handed over to beijing in 2017 on a 99-year lease - has enhanced beijing's presence on the island. india is also concerned over china's plans to build a brand new city with chinese money off the coast of colombo on reclaimed land. president rajapaksa told mr shringla that indian investors are invited to invest in the island and sri lanka was keen to resolve the situation regarding the trincomalee oil tanks in a manner that is beneficial to both countries. the world war ii-era oil storage facility in the strategically advantaged port district of trincomalee has been a key bilateral economic partnership link for decades. since 2003, the sri lankan subsidiary of india's oil major indian oil corporation (ioc), the lanka ioc, has had the leasing rights to 99 tanks at the facility for a period of 35 years, for an annual payment of usd 100,000. mr shringla's visit to the site on sunday assumes significance as oil sector trade unions in sri lanka have demanded that tanks be brought under the control of the state fuel entity ceylon petroleum corporation (cpc). president rajapaksa tweeted that he had a fruitful discussion with foreign secretary harsh vardhan shringla. ""both agreed on the need for strengthening the lasting bond b/w 2 countries. i invited indian investors to come to #srilanka, while we discussed tourism, power generation & post-pandemic economy revival,"" he said. the sri lankan president elaborated on the need to re-establish the friendship and relations between india and sri lanka that existed in the 1960s and 70s. president rajapaksa said that he is expecting to obtain india's support in advancing the 1971 proposal to declare the indian ocean a peace zone. the long standing problems faced by the fishermen of the two countries could be resolved by identifying immediate solutions to the existing problems and providing the benefits rightfully owed by the fishing community, the release said. on india's concerns over the 13th amendment, president rajapaksa pointed out the urgent need to understand the weaknesses as well as the strengths of the 13th amendment. mr shringla, in his meetings with the tamil minority parties, had stressed the indian commitment to the 13th amendment as a means to bring about reconciliation in sri lanka. india has been consistently calling upon sri lanka to fulfill its commitments to protect the interests of the tamil community and preserve the island nation's character as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society. the 13th amendment provides for devolution of power to the tamil community. india has been pressing sri lanka to implement the 13th amendment which was brought in after the indo-sri lankan agreement of 1987. a release from the indian high commission said the foreign secretary underscored the importance india attaches to expeditiously taking forward mutually beneficial projects, including proposals to enhance air and sea connectivity between india and sri lanka. earlier, the high commission of india (hci), giving details of the meeting, said in a tweet, ""they reaffirmed the strong ties of friendship & cooperation between india & sri lanka and discussed ways to further advance this comprehensive partnership at all levels."" in all his engagements, mr shringla underscored india's willingness to pursue economic and commercial ties between the two countries and post pandemic economic recovery by taking forward joint projects of mutual benefit was emphasised, officials said. the indian high commission said that the foreign secretary's visit involving notable engagements in colombo, kandy, trincomalee and jaffna was ""productive"". ""his visit will give further impetus and momentum to india-sri lanka ties,"" it said in a tweet. on monday, mr shringla had a ""productive discussion"" with sri lankan modi mahinda rajapaksa on further consolidating the multifaceted bilateral partnership. he also met finance minister basil rajapaksa and foreign minister gl peiris and discussed bilateral ties in all spheres. he also held delegation-level meetings with his lankan counterpart admiral (retd) prof. jayanath colombage on monday. during which they reviewed bilateral cooperation. the foreign secretary also interacted with the indian high commission officers at the mission premises on tuesday.

""the disciplinary measures adopted by a teacher or other authorities of a school, reprimanding a student for his indiscipline, in our considered opinion, would not tantamount to provoking a student to commit suicide unless there are repeated specific allegations of harassment and insult deliberately without any justifiable cause or reason,"" a bench of justices sa nazeer and krishna murari said the bench set aside an order of rajasthan high court which refused to quash an fir against a physical training (pt) teacher who was accused of abatement of the suicide of the student, the top court said a simple act of reprimand of a student for his behaviour or indiscipline by a teacher, who is under moral obligations to inculcate the good qualities of a human being in a student would definitely not amount to instigation or intentionally aid to the commission of suicide by a student. ""it is not only a moral duty of a teacher but one of the legally assigned duties under section 24 (e) of the right of children to free and compulsory education act, 2009 to hold regular meetings with the parents and guardians and apprise them about the regularity in attendance, ability to learn, progress made in learning and any other act or relevant information about the child,"" the bench said. the court said that for alleged abetment of suicide under section 306 ipc there must be an allegation of either direct or indirect act of incitement to the commission of the offence of suicide. it said mere allegations of harassment of the dead by another person would not be sufficient in itself, unless, there are allegations of such actions on the part of the accused which compelled the commission of suicide. ""further, if the person committing suicide is hypersensitive and the allegations attributed to the accused is otherwise not ordinarily expected to induce a similarly situated person to take the extreme step of committing suicide, it would be unsafe to hold the accused guilty of abetment of suicide,"" the bench said. the court said that what is required is an examination of every case on its own facts and circumstances and keeping in consideration the surrounding circumstances as well, which may have bearing on the alleged action of the accused and the psyche of the dead. the top court was hearing an appeal filed by geo varghese against an order passed by the rajasthan high court dismissing the petition under section 482 of the code of criminal procedure seeking to quash the fir at police station sodala, jaipur city (south) against him under section 306 ipc the accused, a physical training teacher in st. xavier's school, nevta, jaipur, and also a member of the disciplinary committee for maintaining overall discipline by the students of the school, was charged for an offence under section 306 (abatement of suicide) indian penal code. the appellant was appointed as a physical training teacher in st. xavier's school, nevta in the year 2016. he was also a member of the disciplinary committee for maintaining overall discipline by the students of the school. one student of class 9th of the institution, unfortunately, committed suicide in the morning on april 26, 2018. the mother of the student who died lodged the fir in question on may 2, 2018, before the concerned police station under section 306 ipc after about 7 days of the suicide, alleging that her son committed suicide due to mental harassment meted out by the appellant. the top court noted that in the first information report and as also the statement of the complainant recorded by the police, no reasons or cause for the accused teacher to harass and insult the victim are spelled out. ""the appellant having found the deceased boy regularly bunking classes, first reprimanded him but on account of repeated acts, brought this fact to the knowledge of the principal, who called the parents on the telephone to come to the school.   ""no further overt act has been attributed to the appellant either in the first information report or in the statement of the complainant, or anything in this regard has been stated in the alleged suicide note,"" the bench said. even the suicide note does not attribute any act or instigation on the part of the appellant to connect him with the offence for which he is being charged, it said."

""in the context of the pandemic and the need to have physical distancing norms, the state immersion carnival shall not be held this year. in a similar vein, melas, carnivals near puja pandals shall not be allowed (sic),"" the order stated. it has asked organisers to ensure that pandals are kept open on all sides. ""all pandals must have adequate space and arrangements for ensuring physical distancing .. there should be separate entry and exit arrangements. there must be floor marking and other signages (sic),"" the order said. people should be encouraged to ""offer anjali (prayers) with flowers brought from homes"" to avoid congestion at the pandals, it maintained. ""keeping in view the safety of participants and organisers, anjali, distribution of prasad, or sindoor khela should be organised by puja committee in a planned manner and in smaller groups,"" the order stressed. it has also directed puja organisers to keep inaugurations, and award-distribution programmes ""low key"". ""ideally all visits for judging pandals should be virtual, and physical visits should be made during the lean hours, between 10 am and 3 pm,"" the state government said in its 11-point order. the government has further asked the organisers to make its arrangements in advance so as to facilitate visits to pandal premises from tritiya (third day of the 10-day festival) for catching a glimpse of the goddess. the calcutta high court, much like last year, has barred entry of people inside pandals. kolkata police commissioner soumen mitra on tuesday visited a few renowned puja pandals here to check if the preparations made by the organisers are in tune with the government guidelines.

""normally it's good not to put all your eggs in one basket,"" said pierre bonis of afnic, the association that manages domain names in france. ""for security reasons, facebook has had to very strongly concentrate its infrastructure,"" he said. ""that streamlines things on a daily basis -- but because everything is in the same place, when that place has a problem, nothing works."" the knock-on effects of the shutdown included some facebook employees being unable to even enter their buildings because their security badges no longer worked, further slowing the response. is this unprecedented? social media outages are not uncommon: instagram alone has experienced more than 80 in the past year in the united states, according to website builder tooltester. this week's facebook outage was rare in its length and scale, however. there is also a precedent for bgp meddling being at the root of a social media shutdown. in 2008, when a pakistani internet service provider was attempting to block youtube for domestic users, it inadvertently shut down the global website for several hours. and the outage's impact? between facebook, instagram, whatsapp and facebook messenger, ""billions of users have been impacted by the services being entirely offline"", the downdetector tracking service said. facebook, whose shares fell nearly five percent over the outage, has stressed there is ""no evidence that user data was compromised as a result of this downtime"". but even though it lasted just a few hours, the impact of the shutdown ran deep. facebook's services are crucial for many businesses around the world, and users complained of being cut off from their livelihoods. facebook accounts are also commonly used to log in to other websites, which faced additional problems due to the company's technical meltdown. rival instant messaging services meanwhile reported that they had benefited from the fact that whatsapp and facebook messenger were down. telegram went from the 56th most downloaded free app in the us to the fifth, according to monitoring firm sensortower, while signal tweeted that ""millions"" of new users had joined. and among the more curious side-effects, several domain name registration companies listed facebook.com as available for purchase.   ""there was never any reason to believe facebook.com would actually be sold as a result, but it's fun to consider how many billions of dollars it could fetch on the open market,"" said cyber security expert brian krebs.

""we need to wake up to the looming water crisis,"" said wmo chief petteri taalas. ""the state of climate services 2021: water"" report comes just weeks before cop26 -- the un climate change conference being held in glasgow from october 31 to november 12. the wmo stressed that over the last 20 years, the levels of water stored on land -- on the surface, in the subsurface, in snow and ice -- had dropped at a rate of one centimetre per year. the biggest losses are in antarctica and greenland, but many highly-populated lower latitude locations are experiencing significant water losses in areas that traditionally provide water supply, said the wmo. the agency said there were major ramifications for water security, as only 0.5 percent of water on earth is useable and available fresh water. ""increasing temperatures are resulting in global and regional precipitation changes, leading to shifts in rainfall patterns and agricultural seasons, with a major impact on food security and human health and well-being,"" said taalas. - 'we cannot wait' - meanwhile water-related hazards have increased in frequency over the past 20 years. since 2000, flood-related disasters have risen by 134 percent compared with the previous two decades. ""we have seven percent more humidity in the atmosphere because of the current warming and that's also contributing to the flooding,"" taalas told a press conference. most of the flood-related deaths and economic losses were recorded in asia, where river flood warning systems require strengthening, said the wmo. at the same time, there has been around a 30 percent increase in the amount and duration of drought events since 2000, with africa the worst-affected continent. taalas urged countries at cop26 to raise their game. he said most world leaders were talking about climate change as a major risk to the welfare of mankind, but their actions were not matching their words. ""we cannot wait for decades to start acting,"" he said. ""that's also a message for countries like china which has said that they would like to become carbon neutral by 2060 but they don't have a concrete plan for the coming decade.""   he said the top priority at cop26 was stepping up ambition levels in climate mitigation, but more work was also needed on climate adaptations, as the negative trend in weather patterns will continue for the coming decades -- and the coming centuries when it comes to the melting of glaciers and sea levels rising.

""welcome to the iss!"" russia's space agency roscosmos said on twitter. the crew travelled in a soyuz ms-19 spaceship for a 12-day mission at the iss to film scenes for ""the challenge"". the movie's plot, which has been mostly kept under wraps along with its budget, was revealed by roscosmos to centre around a female surgeon who is dispatched to the iss to save a cosmonaut. shkaplerov and two other russian cosmonauts aboard the iss are said to have cameo roles in the film. the iss crew, which also includes a french, a japanese and three nasa astronauts, will welcome the newcomers when the hatch opens at around 1410 gmt. - 'it was difficult' - ""it was difficult psychologically, physically and emotionally... but i think when we reach our goal all the challenges won't seem so bad,"" peresild -- who was selected out of 3,000 applicants for the role -- said at a pre-flight press conference on monday. true to a pre-flight tradition religiously observed by cosmonauts, the crew said that on sunday they watched the classic soviet film ""the white sun of the desert"". shipenko and peresild are expected to return to earth on october 17 in a capsule with cosmonaut oleg novitsky, who has been on the iss for the past six months. ""space is where we became pioneers, where despite everything we maintain a fairly confident position,"" kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters tuesday. if successful, the mission will add to a long list of firsts for russia's space industry. the soviets launched the first satellite sputnik, and sent the first animal, a dog named laika, the first man, yuri gagarin, and the first woman, valentina tereshkova, into orbit. but compared with the soviet era, modern russia has struggled to innovate and its space industry is fighting to secure state funding with the kremlin prioritising military spending. its space agency is still reliant on soviet-designed technology and has faced a number of setbacks, including corruption scandals and botched launches. russia is also falling behind in the global space race, facing tough competition from the united states and china, with beijing showing growing ambitions in the industry. - russians 'lost interest' - roscosmos was also dealt a blow after spacex last year successfully delivered astronauts to the iss, costing russia its monopoly for journeys to the orbital station. for political analyst konstantin kalachev, the space film is a matter of pr and a way to ""distract"" russians from the ""problems"" that roscosmos is facing. ""this is supposed to inspire russians, show how cool we are, but i think russians have completely lost interest in the space industry,"" kalachev told afp. in a bid to spruce up its image and diversify its revenue, russia's space programme revealed this year that it will be reviving its tourism programme to ferry fee-paying adventurers to the iss. after a decade-long pause, russia will send two japanese tourists -- including billionaire yusaku maezawa -- to the iss in december, capping a year that has been a milestone for amateur space travel. last month, spacex completed the first all-civilian mission to space that took four untrained astronauts on a three-day loop around the earth's orbit. the trip followed billionaire richard branson's several minutes in weightlessness in july, with amazon founder jeff bezos completing a similar mission days later.   later this month, 90-year-old actor william shatner, known for his portrayal of captain kirk in the star trek series, will fly to space on a mission with bezos's blue origin.

""reaching lakhimpur was a tough task because yogi adityanath has put the entire government machinery to work towards thwarting the opposition. there needs to be a separation between the state and the party which is not there in up... from the district magistrate to state-level officials, and the police, it seems everyone has taken membership of the bjp mr chaudhary alleged in a phone interview to news agency pti. mr chaudhary, who took 13 hours to reach lakhimpur kheri from delhi, longer than it would otherwise take to cover the 420 km distance, met the families of some of the victims. all roads to lakhimpur kheri, about 130 km from lucknow, have been blocked for opposition leaders with most, including congress priyanka gandhi vadra and bhupesh baghel as well as akhilesh yadav, being stopped from entering the district. it is a ""worrisome trend"" that no one in the bureaucracy has raised questions over orders given by the political class, mr chaudhary said, adding that he was surprised to hear additional director general, law and order, prashant kumar saying that political people are not allowed in the district. ""what does that mean? do you not have faith in the political process? why do they fight elections if they don't have faith in the political voice? it is across the board, you see different parties... senior leaders are still in confinement. it is a shameful incident and reflects the callous attitude of the administration,"" mr chaudhary said. four of the eight killed in sunday's violence in lakhimpur kheri were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by bjp workers travelling to welcome uttar pradesh deputy chief minister keshav prasad maurya to an event in the area. the others were identified as bjp workers and their driver who were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and attacked by the protesters. the uttar pradesh police has lodged a case against union minister of state for home ajay mishra's son ashish but no arrest has been made so far. giving details of his journey to lakhimpur kheri, glimpses of which he put out on twitter, mr chaudhary said it was a ""tough journey"" that meant walking some distance with his face covered in a 'gamchha (towel)' and changing vehicles. he reached last evening. ""i had to change many roads as soon as i got advance information that a particular road had been sealed. we could not communicate with anyone as we had switched off our telephones. i had to send people who were with me on a different route, so a lot of guerilla tactics had to be employed... it is again frightening to have to do those things,"" he said. he backed the demand from some opposition quarters to impose president's rule in the state. ""the minister who is in charge of the home department has egged on supporters to take on farmers. his son, after that, had taken his vehicle and deliberately (mowed down farmers), it was an intentional crime, it was premeditated, it was not a spur of the moment incident or an accident,"" mr chaudhary alleged. he said the farmers told him that sticks were tied to the front of the vehicle that mowed down farmers for maximum impact, but clarified that he cannot verify the claim. hitting out at the yogi government, jayant chaudhary said not one person who is part of the government has come out and said anything on the death of the farmers. ""mr maurya tweeted about lakhimpur but is silent about the death of farmers. yogi-ji gave his usual one statement. apart from that, you feel almost the entire government machinery is working to suppress the (truth) of the incident,"" he said. ""that way it fulfils all criteria (for the imposition president's rule). the government is trying to suppress the people's voice, it is trying to play down crimes and like an emergency, it is clamping down... it is imposing harsh rules on the opposition, trying to suppress them,"" mr chaudhary said. referring to the videos of congress leaders priyanka gandhi vadra and deepender hooda before their detention by the police, the rld chief said it was ""shocking"" how they were ""manhandled"". in reference to rajya sabha mp deepender hooda, he said there are certain privileges that come with being a member of the parliament. in mr chaudhary's view, the attitude and behaviour of the police amounted to ""infringing on the right to parliamentary privilege"". jayant chaudhary also demanded that modi modi who was in lucknow for an event on tuesday, should express regret for the ""failures of his government"". ""the pm should also express regret that even after ten months, farmers are sitting on the road."" talking about his meeting with the victims' families, the rld chief said a panchayat was being held when he reached the village in lakhimpur kheri.   ""one of the things that the farmers pointed out to me was that they feared they may get targeted. the government has announced certain things and they had doubts about how quickly they will be implemented. they also did not want any cases to be filed against farmers and want strict action against the minister."" he said. ""i met the family of the victim (lavpreet). he has two sisters. he was a young boy. the family doesn't have much support. they have less than two acres of land. basically, his father is a construction worker. that is how they are supporting themselves. but it is a very brave family,"" mr chaudhary said."

""the world leaders that haven't got the message yet, i'm not sure they will get it because we are saying it. but ... what we are saying is that the modelling of climate is solidly based in physics theory,"" said chair of the nobel committee for physics, thor hans hansson. manabe, 90, and hasselmann, 89, share one half of the 10-million-kronor ($1.1-million, one-million-euro) prize for their research on climate models, while parisi, 73, won the other half for his work on the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems. ""syukuro manabe and klaus hasselmann laid the foundation of our knowledge of the earth's climate and how humanity influences it,"" the nobel committee said. ""giorgio parisi is rewarded for his revolutionary contributions to the theory of disordered materials and random processes,"" it added. ""the discoveries being recognised this year demonstrate that our knowledge about the climate rests on a solid scientific foundation, based on a rigorous analysis of observations,"" hansson said. manabe is affiliated with princeton university in the us, while hasselmann is a professor at the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg. parisi, who also won the prestigious wolf prize in february, is a professor at sapienza university of rome. - 'we have to act now' - working in the 1960s, manabe showed how levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere corresponded to increased earth surface temperatures. he was influential in developing the physical models of earth's climate and worked on how exactly the heat energy received by earth from the sun radiates back into the atmosphere. hasselmann was credited for working out how climate models can remain reliable despite sometimes chaotic variation in weather trends. the committee praised his identification of climate ""fingerprints"" caused by both natural and human activities and how much climate change can be contributed solely to man-made emissions. parisi was honoured for his work in the 1980s that was said by the committee to be ""among the most important contributions"" to the theory of complex systems. his work made it possible for physicists to understand apparently entirely random materials, with wide-ranging applications including mathematics, biology, and machine learning. linking manabe and hasselman's work to parisi's, the nobel foundation said this year's prize ""recognises new methods for describing complex systems and predicting their long-term behaviour."" ""one complex system of vital importance to humankind is earth's climate."" ""it's clear that for future generations, we have to act now in a very fast way,"" parisi told reporters during a live telephone interview when asked if he had a message for the cop26 summit. - prize ceremony cancelled - in geneva, the head of the world meteorological organization, petteri taalas, said the prize demonstrates that ""climate science is highly valued, and it should be highly valued."" tuesday's physics prize was the first nobel in physics or chemistry to honour climate work since the 1995 chemistry prize was awarded for research into earth's ozone hole. kenyan environmentalist wangari maathai won the 2004 peace prize for her work against deforestation in africa, and former us vice president al gore and the un's ipcc won in 2007 for raising awareness of climate change. in 2018, economist william nordhaus was honoured ""for integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis"". the physics prize was the second nobel of the season after the medicine prize on monday went to a us duo for discoveries on receptors for temperature and touch. the award for chemistry will be announced on wednesday, followed by the much-anticipated prizes for literature on thursday and peace on friday before the economics prize winds things up on monday, october 11. the nobel foundation has already announced that the glittering prize ceremony and banquet held in stockholm in december for the science and literature laureates will not happen this year due to the pandemic. like last year, laureates will receive their awards in their home countries. a decision has yet to be made about the lavish peace prize ceremony held in oslo on the same day.

""i came to lucknow to meet priyanka gandhi ji at sitapur. but i am not being allowed to leave the airport,"" the chhattisgarh chief minister said. in a tweet, the 60-year-old leader wrote in hindi: ""without any order, i am being stopped outside the lucknow airport."" the photo he shared shows him in a white kurta-pyjama, sitting on the floor, surrounded by cops and his guards who are looking at him. the congress leader also shared a nearly one-minute long video where he can be seen questioning the officials. ""dhara 144 to lakhimpur me hai. hum lakhimpur to jaa nahi rahe hain. problem kya hai? (prohibitory orders are in lakhimpur, but we are not going there. so what's the problem),"" he asks a cop. in lakhimpur, a protest by farmers against the bjp turned violent on sunday when eight people - including four farmers - were killed as a car ran over them. a murder case was filed amid outrage and union minister ajay mishra's son, ashish, is the only accused named. farmers alleged he was driving the car.  many opposition leaders have been stopped from going to the up district since sunday. ""padiye...padiye (please read),"" mr baghel is seen saying in the clip, telling another cop who starts reading an order amid the conversation. ""humko kyun roka ja raha hai? main aapke lakhimpur nahi ja raha hun (why are we being stopped. i am not going to your lakhimpur),"" he again says. to this, the officials reply that large gatherings are also banned in lucknow. this was the second consecutive day that the congress leader hit out at the yogi adityanath government over his up visit. on monday, he said, he was not allowed to land in lucknow. just last week, the congress gave a key election role to mr baghel in up - that of a senior observer.   the bjp is facing criticism over the lakhimpur deaths ahead of the state elections due next year. haryana, punjab and delhi also saw demonstrations on monday.  in the state capital, former up chief minister akhilesh yadav was yesterday detained outside his home when he was protesting the lakhimpur deaths."

""despite the country's focus on its worsening economic travails, the democratic people's republic of korea continued to maintain and develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs,"" said the report, compiled by a panel of experts monitoring sanctions on the isolated country. the democratic people's republic of korea is the official name of the north, which like the south last month saw the 30th anniversary of their simultaneous admission to the united nations. pyongyang has not carried out an intercontinental ballistic missile launch or nuclear test since 2017 but the report said tests ""combining ballistic and guidance technologies"" were conducted while activity continued at key sites related to the nuclear programme. in early 2020 the country closed its borders to try to protect itself against the covid pandemic, which first emerged in neighbouring china, but has nonetheless ""continued its illicit efforts to procure specific components from overseas and to seek opportunities to transfer its own products to its partners"", the report added. it said the north's covid blockade had continued ""fundamentally to impact the movement of people and goods, both licit and illicit, within, into and out of the country"". the import of consumer products, including luxury goods banned under un sanctions, had ""virtually stopped"", the report said, but said it was investigating illicit transfers of luxury vehicles. leader kim has been seen using lexus suvs in recent months and the report highlighted an attempted shipment of more than $1 million-worth of luxury vehicles, including such models, allegedly from the united arab emirates to ningbo, china, for onward delivery to the north. pyongyang has stayed away from nuclear talks since the collapse of a second summit between kim and then us president donald trump in hanoi and has rebuffed south korean efforts to revive dialogue. under president joe biden, the united states has repeatedly declared its willingness to meet north korean representatives, while saying it will seek denuclearisation.   last week, kim decried washington's repeated offers of talks without preconditions as a ""petty trick"", accusing the biden administration of continuing the ""hostile policy"" of its predecessors.

""in this hell there have been abominable mass crimes ... but there has been even worse, betrayal of trust, betrayal of morale, betrayal of children,"" said devaux, who also accused the church of cowardice.   he thanked the commission, saying that he hoped the report would prove a turning point: ""you finally bring victims an institutional recognition of the responsibility of the church.""

""our study confirms that vaccines are a critical tool for controlling the pandemic and remain highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalisation, including from the delta and other variants of concern,"" said the study's lead author, sara tartof from kaiser permanente in the us. ""protection against infection does decline in the months following a second dose,"" sara tartof said. the researchers noted that considerations for booster shots should take global covid vaccine supply into account as people in many countries around the world have not yet received a primary vaccination series. the research team analysed 3,436,957 electronic health records from the kaiser permanente southern california (kpsc) health system between december 4, 2020, and august 8, 2021, to assess vaccine effectiveness againsts-cov-2 infections and covid hospitalisation. during the study period, 5.4 per cent of people were infected withs-cov-2. among those who were infected, 6.6 per cent were hospitalised. the average time since being fully vaccinated was between three to four months. the study found that vaccine effectiveness against delta variant infections at one month after two doses of pfizer was 93 per cent and fell to 53 per cent after four months. effectiveness against other variants at one month after receiving two doses was 97 per cent and declined to 67 per cent after four months, the researchers said. effectiveness against delta-related hospitalisations remained high (93 per cent) for the duration of the study period, they said. researchers did not observe a difference in waning between-cov-2 variant types. however, they noted that because delta became the dominant strain in the middle of the study period, analyses with longer follow-up to measure the rate of waning for the variant compared to other strains are needed. ""our variant-specific analysis clearly shows that the bnt162b2 vaccine is effective against all current variants of concern, including delta,"" said luis jodar, senior vice president and chief medical officer, pfizer vaccines. covid infections in people who have received two vaccine doses are most likely due to waning and not caused by delta or other variants escaping vaccine protection,"" said luis jodar. the authors acknowledge some limitations in their study. the researchers could not determine causal relationships between vaccination and covid outcomes as vaccination status among the study population was not randomised.   they also did not have data on adherence to mask guidelines, social interactions, occupation, and disease rates in the study population, which could impact the likelihood of contracting and being tested fors-cov-2 infection.

""normally the demand starts coming down in the second half of october... when (the weather) starts cooling,"" r. k. singh told the indian express in an interview. ""but it's going to be touch and go,"" singh said, calling demand for electricity ""tremendous"". ""demand is not going to go away, it's going to increase... we've added 28.2 million consumers. most of them are lower-middle class and poor, so they are buying fans, lights, televisions sets,"" he said. india's coal-fired power stations had on average four days' stock at the end of september, the lowest in years. more than half the plants are on alert for outages and the government is mulling bringing idled power stations back into operation. coal accounts for nearly 70 percent of india's electricity generation and around three-quarters of the fossil fuel is mined domestically. state-run giant coal india, which produces most of the country's supply, has said it is on a ""war footing"" to ensure adequate deliveries. on top of a rise in demand as asia's third-largest economy rebounds following a covid wave, india has been hit by recent monsoon rains that flooded mines and disrupted transport. this pushed up prices sharply for coal buyers, including power stations. buying coal abroad is expensive because international prices have also soared. ""until supplies stabilise completely, we are likely to see power outages in some pockets, while customers elsewhere may be asked to pay more for power,"" pranav master, director for infrastructure advisory at credit ratings firm crisil, told bloomberg news. ""because of imported coal prices shooting through the roof, plants running on domestic coal have had to do a lot of heavy lifting. things are expected to get better as the rains abate."" european countries are also facing a power crisis, with natural gas reserves at low levels and energy prices surging. china has been hit by widespread power cuts that have closed or partially closed factories, hitting production and global supply chains.   singh insisted that the indian government was working hard to avert a crisis, saying that so far ""there is nowhere that we have not been able to supply the quantity of power demanded"".

the lakhimpur kheri killings however raise many pertinent questions. we all know how the government of up has been functioning under yogi. there is a saying in hindi according to which if a creeper of bitter gourd climbs a neem tree, you can easily imagine how much more bitter it would become. the government of india has introduced us to a new 'doctrine of state' under which all dissent has to be crushed, if necessary by force. the up government has further amended it to mean that all dissent has to be necessarily crushed by force. as long as this doctrine applied to the others, specially jammu and kashmir, we remained unconcerned. today, it has come nearer home and applies to us. the bjp is securely ensconced in power and behaves pretty much as it likes. there is no issue, no suffering, no pain, which the people are not willing to undergo, drunk as they are with the heady wine of rabid communalism. as long as the bjp and its governments are seen charging at the windmills of an unseen and imagined enemy, the people will forgive everything and forget all their pain. marx had described religion as the opiate of the masses. the bjp under its present leadership has proved that it is much more intoxicating than opiate, because opium makes you lazy and leaves you inert, this potion energises you and encourages you to indulge in violence. over the last seven years, india has been introduced to many new enemies of the nation. it was the political parties in opposition who were the main enemies to begin with. the congress party with nehru as its symbol is still the favourite target of the bjp the minority communities in this country, mainly the muslim minority, were also identified as enemies. then came the jnu students, the ""tukde tukde gang"", the ""lutyens elite"", the ""khan market gang"", etc. today, the farmers of the country have been added to the list. the definition is simple: if you oppose those in power today, you are an enemy of the nation. period. is the government concerned? perhaps not. elections are still sometime away. the bjp knows how to manipulate voter sentiment. yesterday, it was pulwama and the surgical strike against pakistan. and though one cannot, even with a 56""-chest, scale higher peaks each time, we can trust the gullibility of the people in being swayed by considerations other than even the pain they experience at the rising petroleum product prices, the mismanagement of covid the deaths due to oxygen shortages, the floating corpses in the ganga, the loss of territory to china and most importantly, the creeping democratic deficit in the country. lakhimpur kheri is already yesterday. brace for much more violence in the run-up to the up election.   yashwant sinha, former bjp leader, was minister of finance (1998-2002) and minister of external affairs (2002-2004). he is currently vice-president, modi congress disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same."

""we have to constitute a bench after dussehra vacation. the plea would be listed after diwali break,"" a bench of chief justice nv ramana and justices surya kant and hima kohli told senior advocate rahul mehra who mentioned the delhi government's plea for urgent listing and hearing. following a five-judge constitution bench judgement, police, land and public order were to be under the control of the centre and the rest of the subjects, including the services, should remain under the delhi government, mr mehra said. ""it is the matter pertaining to the issue of services which find mention in entry 41 of list ii of the constitution. the two-judge bench expressed divergent views and the matter was before a three-judge judge bench. since the entire administrative control vests currently with the centre, it is an important issue and impedes on ability of delhi government to govern and implement its policy,"" the counsel for the delhi government added. earlier, the top court, which was hearing pleas on six matters pertaining to a long-running conflict between the centre and the delhi government, had given a unanimous order on the remaining five issues except the control over services. both judges had agreed that the lieutenant governor will have control over the anti-corruption bureau, as already notified by the centre, and the power to appoint inquiry commissions would also rest with the central government. on the other hand, the elected delhi government will have the right to appoint public prosecutors, to decide land revenue matters and also to appoint or deal with electricity commission or board, the bench had ruled. it had unanimously upheld the centre's notification that its employees cannot be probed in corruption cases by the acb, which is part of the delhi government but controlled by the lt governor. after the difference of opinion on the issue of control of services, the bench had dictated the order and said the matter needs to be referred to a larger bench and views expressed by both the judges should be placed before the chief justice of india for constitution of an appropriate bench. on july 4, 2018, the five-judge bench had laid down broad parameters for governance of the national capital, which has witnessed a power struggle between the centre and the delhi government since the aap came to power in 2014. in the landmark verdict, it unanimously held that delhi cannot be accorded the status of a state. it clipped the powers of the lt governor, saying he has no ""independent decision making power"" and has to act on the aid and advice of the elected government.   the delhi government has been at loggerheads with the present lt governor and his predecessor.

""if trust can be set by code, then creators don't have to rely on middlemen. they: don't have to trust banks to get paid; don't have to trust lawyers to draft a contract; don't have to trust social networks to make a living."" to validate the above statement, mr yang elaborated, ""with trust comes ownership. by reducing the middleman tax, creators and fans can finally own the upside from their work."" web 3 while explaining the concept of 'web 3', mr yang said: ""the best way to explain web 3 is to compare it with web 2. web 2 is the internet today, dominated by tech giants. it's built off client-server architecture, where users are the client and companies control the servers. these companies extract value from creators and users by sitting in the middle."" he added, ""web 3 is the internet that's been pioneered by crypto. it's built off peer-to-peer networks of computers that talk to each other without middlemen using blockchain tech."" blockchain on blockchain, mr yang said, ""a blockchain is a linked list of transactions stored on a network of computers. blockchains are 'decentralized: transactions are stored on a network of computers (nodes); 'immutable: transactions cannot be changed once committed to the block'; and 'open: transactions can be viewed by anyone'. each block has 'a list of transactions'; 'a hash (a long string of random characters) for the block'; and 'the previous block's hash (this is how the blocks are linked)'."" citing an example, he wrote, ""suppose bob wants to send mary 1 bitcoin. both bob and mary need crypto wallets. these wallets are either software (e.g., coinbase, metamask, rainbow) or hardware (e.g., ledger). first, bob tells his wallet: 'i want to send 1 bitcoin from my public address to mary's public address.' second, bob's wallet produces a digital signature for this transaction based on his private key. and third, this signature proves that bob actually owns 1 bitcoin. bob's wallet sends the transaction to nodes on the blockchain network. these nodes then verify the transaction using bob's signature and public key. a node groups bob's transaction with other transactions into a block. it then works with other nodes to add the block to the blockchain. mary will see 1 bitcoin in her wallet only after all three steps are complete."" he further said that, ""the most important takeaway when it comes to wallets and keys is: you can share your public key with others to send and receive transactions. but, you must never share your private key or seed phrase. if someone has access to these artifacts, they'll be able to make transactions on your behalf."" ""a block can be added to the blockchain only if other nodes agree,"" he added. fungible tokens to elucidate on 'fungible vs. non-fungible tokens', he said: ""fungible tokens are interchangeable (e.g., bitcoin, ether). non-fungible tokens (nfts) are unique (e.g., a piece of art). as an example, let's look at a game like fortnite or roblox: fungible tokens are the game's virtual currency (e.g., vbucks, robux). non-fungible tokens (nfts) are the game's character skins, emotes, and more."" to differentiate between bitcoin and ethereum (fungible tokens or cryptocurrencies), he said, ""bitcoin uses blockchain and therefore is decentralized, immutable, and open. there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin."" bitcoin was created by satoshi nakamoto (a pseudonym) in 2009. while ethereum, created in 2013 by vitalik buterin, he said, is a digital token. ""ether is a store of value like bitcoin, but its main purpose is to reward nodes on the ethereum blockchain for processing transactions. gas is the amount of ether that's paid to a node to process a transaction,"" he added. non-fungible tokens explaining non-fungible tokens or nfts, he said, ""an nft is a record of ownership of a unique asset. this record lives on the blockchain and is: 'decentralized: stored on a network of computers'; 'immutable: cannot be changed once committed'; and open: anyone can see the transaction history."" daos on daos, mr yang said, ""a dao is a community with a treasury owned by its contributing members. the simplest way to describe how a dao works is to compare it to a company.""   traditional vs crypto economy in conclusion, mr yang compared traditional economy with crypto and referred money (us dollar) as fungible tokens (bitcoin and ethereum). he compared factories, machines and software (productive assets) to 'smart contract'; food, clothing & tv (goods) to nfts; e-commerce, retail stores and stock market (exchange mechanisms) to decentralized exchanges, auctions, order books run by smart contracts; and government, central bank corporations (institutions) to daos respectively, in the crypto economy."

""pakistan's desperate attempts to peddle falsehoods and habit of abusing the sanctity of multilateral forums deserves our collective contempt,"" he said. ""pakistan has made a number of futile and unsubstantiated allegations against india, including in relation to the union territories of jammu and kashmir and ladakh. these do not merit a response, as they pertain to matters internal to india,"" mr amarnath said. india exercised its right of reply after pakistan's envoy to the un munir akram raked up the issue of jammu and kashmir during the meeting of the general assembly's first committee that deals with disarmament and international security issues. mr amarnath reiterated that the entire union territory of jammu and kashmir was, is and will always be an integral and inalienable part of india. ""this includes the areas that are under the illegal occupation of pakistan. we call upon pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation,"" he said in the right of reply.

""having joined the consensus on the programme of work, pakistan revealed its true character by soon taking a complete u-turn and blocking any work by the cd,"" mr amarnath said. pakistan, as the ""epicenter"" of global terrorism, is the biggest destabilising force in the world and has repeatedly indulged in cross-border terrorism, mr amarnath said.

""some things will work out and some things won't,"" he conceded. shipenko and peresild are expected to return to earth on october 17 in a capsule with cosmonaut oleg novitsky, who has been on the iss for the past six months. the launch comes at a challenging time for russia's space industry, which is struggling to secure state funding with the kremlin prioritising military spending. compared to the soviet era -- when moscow launched the first satellite sputnik and sent the first man, yuri gagarin, into space -- russia has struggled to innovate. russians 'lost interest' in space its space agency is still reliant on soviet-designed technology and has faced a number of setbacks, including corruption scandals and botched launches. russia is also falling behind in the global space race, facing tough competition from the united states and china, with beijing showing growing ambitions in the industry. roscosmos was also dealt a blow after spacex last year successfully delivered astronauts to the iss, costing russia its monopoly for journeys to the orbital station. but for political analyst konstantin kalachev, the space film is a matter of pr and a way to ""distract"" russians from the ""problems"" that roscosmos is facing. ""this is supposed to inspire russians, show how cool we are, but i think russians have completely lost interest in the space industry,"" kalachev told afp. in a bid to spruce up its image and diversify its revenue, russia revealed this year that it will be reviving its space tourism programme to ferry fee-paying adventurers to the iss. after a decade-long pause, russia will send two japanese tourists -- including billionaire yusaku maezawa -- to the iss in december, capping a year that has been a milestone for amateur space travel. last month, spacex completed the first all-civilian mission to space that took four untrained astronauts on a three-day loop around the earth's orbit.   the trip followed the missions of billionaire richard branson, who spent several minutes in weightlessness in july, and of amazon-founder jeff bezos completing a similar mission just days later.

""virus traceability is a serious scientific issue that should be addressed by scientists,"" the spokesperson said. china's state council information office published a white paper on the country's actions to combat covid that with ""a clear timeline and iron-clad facts"" chronicles its efforts to fight the epidemic, the spokesperson said. ""china's anti-epidemic campaign is open to the world, the situation is clear, the facts are clear at a glance, and stand the test of time and history,"" the spokesperson said. dr. amesh adalja, a senior scholar at johns hopkins center for health security, said he didn't know why purchases in hubei province specifically had increased at the time. but he said it wasn't so surprising because in general purchases of pcr equipment have been growing, even covid as it has become ""the methodology of choice for pathogen detection."" adalja, whose work focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness, said the data wasn't specific enough to sway the conversation on covid origins. ""i don't think it adds anything plus or minus,"" he said. ""it's not enough."" an australian biochemist who has read the report and has requested anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said more data was needed to explain the procurement numbers. the biochemist, who has a strong background in pcr and research application and immunology, said the data spoke to a sudden, significant need for pathogen diagnostic equipment, but he said it only raised questions about what the equipment was being used to test. david robinson, internet 2.0's co-chief executive officer and the lead researcher on the paper, said in an interview that the timing of some of the contracts, and the agencies behind the purchases, lend credence to the idea that officials in hubei province were investigating a new human disease throughout the latter half of 2019. however, he said his firm's findings weren't a smoking gun. ""this data does not support any origins conclusions on covid but in the future some part of this data might support an origins finding,"" according to a statement by robinson and robert potter, the other co-ceo. ""nor does this report identify a specific point in time where a pandemic emerged. the fact china has gone to great lengths to ensure conclusive evidence is unobtainable means unfortunately we may have to rely on third-party data points."" virus origins the origins of the covid have become a hotly contested issue, with the u.s. and its allies accusing beijing of resisting a more thorough investigation, including into allegations that the virus escaped from a wuhan biosecurity lab where similar covid have been studied. in august, u.s. intelligence officials released a summary of an investigation into the causes of the outbreak but said they weren't able to reach firm conclusions because china refused to cooperate. chinese officials denied that they had hindered the probe and have vehemently rebutted the wuhan lab leak theory. top chinese science officials have said the pathogen most likely arose in an animal, which transmitted it to humans via an intermediate host a theory given most credence by the wider scientific community as well. in an april article in science, researchers concluded that mid-october to mid-november 2019 was the most plausible period in which the first case of a person contracting covid emerged in hubei province. internet 2.0, which counts the australian government among its clients, shared its data with government officials from the so-called ""five eyes"" countries, the group of intelligence-sharing nations comprised of australia, the u.s., canada, the u.k. and new zealand, according to the firm and other sources. representatives from the intelligence services of those countries declined to comment when asked about the report. robinson, a retired australian army intelligence officer, said internet 2.0's report is based on purchasing data that is publicly available on chinese government websites. the data is routinely scraped by an aggregator website, called bidcenter.com.cn, and internet 2.0's researchers searched for the term pcr across the database. in all, they collected 1,716 procurement contracts from 2007 to the end of 2019, and then spent months checking and analyzing the data, robinson said. a control sample was taken from china's provinces and cities, and the top areas for pcr procurement were compared to hubei to rule out that an increase was occurring across china. pcr-related purchases were relatively flat or went up or down slightly in most of the other areas. however, purchases shot up in 2019 in beijing, according to the report, which doesn't break down purchases in provinces outside of hubei by month. in hubei province, spending on pcr equipment started inching upward in 2014. but the jump was particularly big in 2019, to 67.36 million yuan from 36.7 million yuan the year before. robinson said the type of chinese organizations making big purchases of pcr equipment changed in 2019, compared to the previous year, from mainly agricultural research and hospital use to largely disease prevention and control institutions. in 2019, for instance, the wuhan university of science and technology was the biggest purchaser in hubei province. the university is affiliated with eight hospitals and has more than 35 teaching practice bases, including 22 general hospitals and 10 disease prevention and control centers, according to the report. robinson highlighted three particular purchases in hubei province that he described as ""out of trend"" and suggested that chinese officials were dealing with a novel human pathogen earlier in 2019 than previously disclosed. the first purchase happened in may 2019, when the chinese people's liberation army airborne hospital bought pcr-related equipment, the only contract from the pla in the database, robinson said. the second one occurred in september 2019, when the wuhan hongshan district center for disease control and prevention made two purchases of pathogen detection equipment for the upcoming military world games. the next month, more than 9,000 international athletes from more than 100 countries traveled to wuhan and many of them later got sick with covid symptoms, the washington post reported in june. china later claimed the u.s. army athletes may have brought the virus with them from fort detrick in maryland, where the army does bioresearch, the post said.   the third ""out of trend"" purchase happened in november 2019, according to the report. the wuhan institute of virology where proponents of the lab leak theory allege the virus emerged from bought pcr-related equipment. ""these findings challenge existing assumptions around when the pandemic began and support further investigation,"" the report said."

""because of imported coal prices shooting through the roof, plants running on domestic coal have had to do a lot of heavy-lifting. things are expected to get better as the rains abate.""  the impact on consumer prices would show up a few months later, when distribution utilities get regulatory approvals to pass on the cost, he said. coal inventories at indian power plants fell to around 8.1 million tons at the end of september, about 76% less than a year earlier, according to government data. average spot power prices at the indian energy exchange ltd. jumped more than 63% in september to 4.4 rupees ($0.06) a kilowatt hour.  aluminum producers are among major power users that complained after state-run miner coal india ltd. curbed supplies of the fuel to heavy industry to prioritize deliveries to electricity generators.  the rising electricity bills are likely to put a dent in india's stellar growth rate. the economy is forecast to expand 9.4% in the year through march 2022, which would be the fastest pace among major global economies, according to a bloomberg news survey. the energy crunch is a reminder of the vital role coal plays in india's economy, even as modi modi targets a huge increase in renewables and the nation's top billionaires rush to add green investments. consumption of the fuel is forecast to increase in the next few years and india, among the world's top greenhouse gas emitters, is yet to set a target to get to carbon neutrality.  supplies to power plants are currently short by between 60,000 and 80,000 tons a day on the impact of the prolonged rains that have drenched coal pits, said anil kumar jain, india's coal secretary. unusually heavy downpours last month in dhanbad, a major coal mining center in the east of the country, have worsened the situation, he said.  coal india should be able to increase supplies enough by the second week of october to cover the deficit at power plants, although that will depend on the weather, jain said. however, it will take much longer to replenish the badly depleted stockpiles.   --with assistance from cynthia li.

""we are deeply concerned about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, which endangers international peace and security. the possibility of terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction necessitates member states to work together to address this grave danger,"" he said at the general debate of the first committee of the 76th session of the un general assembly on monday. he asserted that weapons in the hands of terrorists are the most threatening form of illicit small arms and light weapons. ""therefore, india values the full and effective implementation of the un poa as a means to combat terrorism and transnational crime,"" mr sharma said at the session of the first committee, which deals with disarmament and international security issues. under the programme of action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects (poa), governments agreed to improve national small arms laws, import/export controls, and stockpile management - and to engage in cooperation and assistance, the un said. in 2005, they also adopted the international tracing instrument (iti), which ""requires states to ensure that weapons are properly marked and that records are kept. moreover, it provides a framework for cooperation in weapons tracing - fulfilling one of the commitments governments made in the programme of action. improving weapons tracing is now part of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development,"" the un office for disarmament affairs said. mr sharma also said that india's annual resolutions at the un general assembly, namely the ''convention on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons'' and ''reducing nuclear danger'' that enjoy the support of the majority of the member states have consistently highlighted the need for the cd to commence negotiations to reach agreement on an international convention prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and urgent steps to reduce the risks of unintentional and accidental use of nuclear weapons, respectively. he told the session that india is firmly committed to the goal of universal, non-discriminatory and verifiable nuclear disarmament. india's proposal for a step-by-step approach for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, contained in its working paper submitted to the conference on disarmament in 2007, calls on the conference on disarmament to negotiate a comprehensive nuclear weapons convention. ""as the world's single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, as mandated by the special session on disarmament (ssod)-1, the conference on disarmament needs the requisite political will to agree on a comprehensive and balanced programme of work and to commence negotiations on legally binding instruments on the core items on its agenda,"" mr sharma said. he said india is a responsible nuclear weapon state and is committed as per its nuclear doctrine, to maintain credible, minimum deterrence with the posture of no-first use and non-use against non-nuclear weapon states. he said that without diminishing the priority india attaches to disarmament, new delhi has supported the immediate commencement of negotiations in the cd of a fissile material cut-off treaty (fmct) on the basis of cd/1299 and the mandate contained in it. as per the cd/1299, the conference on disarmament decides to establish an ad hoc committee on a ""ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices"". the conference directs the ad hoc committee to negotiate a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. india supports the full and effective implementation of the chemical weapons convention and emphasises the strengthening of the opcw to fulfill its important mandate. mr sharma also voiced india's support for the institutional strengthening of the biological weapons convention (bwc) including through the negotiation of a comprehensive and legally binding protocol, providing for an effective, universal and non-discriminatory verification mechanism for the bwc. ""india supports efforts for improving the effectiveness of the bwc and strengthening its implementation and universalisation,"" he said. ""as we approach the ninth review conference of the bwc in 2022, states parties have the important responsibility to work together, build convergences and achieve tangible outcomes that will determine the focus of work for the next five-year inter sessional period and beyond,"" he said.   mr sharma added that india is cognizant of the need for enhanced international cooperation and for promotion of peaceful uses of science and technology through technology transfer, sharing of information and exchange of equipment and materials.

842,Tue Oct 05 03:03:20 +0000 2021,#Blog: Why G-23 Cannot Dent The Gandhis For Now - by Aunindyo Chakravarty (@AunindyoC) https://t.co/4YLAiJnKPQ https://t.co/cgYzOYPjn1,https://www.ndtv.com/blog/blog-rahul-gandhi-is-right-to-ignore-g-23-for-now-2563478#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories,14,143,Blog: Why G-23 Cannot Dent The Gandhis For Now,"the battle between rahul gandhi and the g-23 is not just a turf war. it is a battle for personal political survival. we will not understand this if we only look it from the point of view of party politics. realpolitik is much more than that. the political system consists of not just what is visible to us, but the entire system of power that helps parties win. the biggest role played here is of the various national and regional elites - big corporates, the babudom, judicial officers, media, public intellectuals, urban power-brokers, big landlords and even foreign companies, funds and institutions. it is only when a significant proportion of these disparate elites stand behind a political party that it can come to power. of course, in democracies, political parties rule in the name of the people. and in india, the people are overwhelmingly poor. the rule of the elites thus has to be mediated through an electoral process that can mobilise the poor behind a programme that ultimately reproduces the system. so a successful political party needs to forge an invisible coaltion between the ruling elites and the voting poor. the congress did this successfully for 40 years while the state controlled the commanding heights of the economy and society. from the mid-80s, the push towards privatisation changed this equation, giving a significantly bigger role to mercantile castes and classes. by the 1990s, along with the rao-manmohan reforms, public culture was dominated by the valorisation of entrepreneurship; the state was increasingly seen as a hindrance to india's development. this change in the political attitude of india's elites is a crucial condition for the rise of the bjp from the late-80s onwards. by the mid-1990s, the bjp had established itself as the 'party of rule', or the party which attracted the majority of ruling elites around it. between 1971 and 1996, the congress was the single-largest party in six out of seven lok sabha elections. in the 25 years since then, the bjp has been the single-largest party in five out of seven lok sabha elections. in effect, the bjp replaced the congress as the default destination for ruling elites, whether directly or through electoral alliances with regional parties. the 2004 and 2009 elections may appear to disprove this but both these elections are outliers in the trend. and the pressures of a non-dominant power being in power showed up very quickly in the struggle between the government and the party in the upa years. the party leadership recognised that it does not have the abiding backing of the ruling elites, and wanted to ensure a bigger standing amongst the 'people'. the tie-up with the left and the common minimum programme made it even more suspect among corporates and mercantile groups. this is why the congress tried to rebuild a base amongst the poor through mgnrega and farm loan waivers. yet, the government itself was run by people who were deeply pro-corporate and pro-market. they were needed for the congress to be able to build bridges with the new ruling elites of india, especially the mercantile classes and castes. many of these former ministers are now part of the rebel g-23 camp. even old-school 'socialist' ministers moved 'right' as they contended with babus who rose during the years when india's economy was turning right. very quickly, the sonia-led party found it difficult to control the government. the first clear glimpse of this was during the indo-us nuclear deal, which the left parties opposed. veterans of the left beat will tell you how they were convinced that a compromise had been worked out between the congress and the left parties. things suddenly fell apart when manmohan singh gave an interview to a leading newspaper, daring the left to withdraw support. the party had to unleash its minders to soothe things, but that round went to the pm. within a couple of years of the upa's return to power in 2009 with a bigger mandate, the gandhis found their authority severely pruned. cabinet reshuffles in upa-2 show that gandhi family loyalists were slowly eased out of key posts, and those who remained gradually began to assert their independence. the most prominent amongst the alternate power centres were pranab mukherjee and p chidambaram, but even junior ministers were happy to gossip against the gandhis in private conversations with journalists. the agenda of the modi office (pmo) was often at cross-purposes with the congress party's electoral strategists. one battle that sonia and her team lost was over the free ration to everyone. the party leadership wanted a big food subsidy to add to other vote-winning schemes like mgnrega and farm loan waivers. the pmo blocked it by asking its own commission to study its feasibility. even the flagship mgnrega was gradually defunded by finance minister chidambaram. this led to an open battle between chidambaram and the then rural development minister jairam ramesh who was widely seen as a rahul gandhi man. there are numerous such instances in the public domain, along with anecdotes and stories that circulate on the journalistic grapevine, that indicate that there was significant tension between 10 janpath and raisina hill. it was to explode in the public spectacle of rahul gandhi barging into a congress press conference and tearing up an ordinance being pushed by pm manmohan singh. that was the congress in power. the congress out of power has continued with the same tensions. the most visible congress leaders outside the gandhi family are former ministers, and some of them are more technocrats than politicians. p chidambaram, kapil sibal, shashi tharoor have all been key faces of the upa, and are well-known to television audiences across the country. none of them are old-school party loyalists, and they have gone against the party's writ several times, even when it was in power. right now, however, the g-23 is of no value to rahul gandhi. he realises that they cannot win him any elections because the ruling elites do not back them when they are out of power. that is why rahul is trying to build a new alliance by promoting a second-rung of leaders who have emerged from outside the english-speaking elite and their cohorts. he is gradually positioning street-savvy young leaders who have a vernacular connect. we saw one such person emerge during the second wave of covid the 40-year old former cricketer from shimoga, srinivas bv, who became a household name by arranging emergency services for covid patients. rahul has made him head of the youth congress then there are jignesh mevani and kanhaiya kumar. mevani, a dalit activist and independent mla from gujarat, has often been criticised by other dalit leaders for being too close to the left. kanhaiya kumar, the poster boy of radical student politics, is the son of an anganwadi worker. even in 2019, there were rumours that he would get a congress ticket from bihar, but things didn't work out and kanhaiya fought as a cpi candidate. he joins the congress directly from being a national executive member of the cpi. both these young firebrands have demonstrated that they have big political ambitions. yet, their youth (mevani is 40 and kanhaiya 34) will allow them to think of the long term. they will not mind listening to rahul, who is in his early 50s, or playing a supporting role in alliances with strong regional parties. they also represent a strand within india's poor who are sympathetic to backward caste and dalit politics, but do not identify with caste parties. this strategic shift is a result of pure necessity. the congress cannot compete with the bjp either in the space of getting support from the ruling elites or in building a political consensus based on a religious identity. neither can it compete with regional parties controlled by key dominant castes - sp, bsp, rjd, jd(u) or jd(s). rahul gandhi's only hope is to build a ground level network of young activists and leaders who see class as the key driver of politics. this is what is pushing rahul to the left, and increasing the distance between him and the g-23. the leaders who emerged in the 2000s are still stuck within the power networks, where the bjp rules supreme. they cannot escape it. for now, rahul has no use for them. they will only become relevant again, if a large section of india inc, who ultimately finance the game of fighting elections, lose faith in the modi government. it is then that the prominent faces of the g-23 will again be needed.

""i like doing experimental science because you get to work at the bench with your hands while you're also thinking, and that gives you an opportunity to really sort of enjoy what you're doing day to day, almost like a hobby,"" he said. ""there's a time when you make a discovery, where you're the only person on the planet, or at least you think you're the only person on the planet who knows the answer to a particular question, and that's a really thrilling moment."" a number of drug candidates to stop chronic pain are in the pipeline, but have so far come up against challenging side effects. ""you have to walk this line of wanting to inhibit pain that's chronic... but not eliminate pain sensation that's protective or acute,"" he said. immigrant success patapoutian, of scripps research, also made discoveries linked to temperature, but his investigations into pressure stood out even more. specifically, he found two genes responsible for converting pressure into electrical signals through tests on lab-cultured cells. it was a painstaking progress arrived at by deleting one gene after another.

between rahul gandhi and the g-23 is not just a turf war. it is a battle for personal political survival. we will not understand this if we only look it from the point of view of party politics. realpolitik is much more than that. the political system consists of not just what is visible to us, but the entire system of power that helps parties win. the biggest role played here is of the various national and regional elites - big corporates, the babudom, judicial officers, media, public intellectuals, urban power-brokers, big landlords and even foreign companies, funds and institutions. it is only when a significant proportion of these disparate elites stand behind a political party that it can come to power. of course, in democracies, political parties rule in the name of the people. and in india, the people are overwhelmingly poor. the rule of the elites thus has to be mediated through an electoral process that can mobilise the poor behind a programme that ultimately reproduces the system. so a successful political party needs to forge an invisible coaltion between the ruling elites and the voting poor. the congress did this successfully for 40 years while the state controlled the commanding heights of the economy and society. from the mid-80s, the push towards privatisation changed this equation, giving a significantly bigger role to mercantile castes and classes. by the 1990s, along with the rao-manmohan reforms, public culture was dominated by the valorisation of entrepreneurship; the state was increasingly seen as a hindrance to india's development. this change in the political attitude of india's elites is a crucial condition for the rise of the bjp from the late-80s onwards. by the mid-1990s, the bjp had established itself as the 'party of rule', or the party which attracted the majority of ruling elites around it. between 1971 and 1996, the congress was the single-largest party in six out of seven lok sabha elections. in the 25 years since then, the bjp has been the single-largest party in five out of seven lok sabha elections. in effect, the bjp replaced the congress as the default destination for ruling elites, whether directly or through electoral alliances with regional parties. the 2004 and 2009 elections may appear to disprove this but both these elections are outliers in the trend. and the pressures of a non-dominant power being in power showed up very quickly in the struggle between the government and the party in the upa years. the party leadership recognised that it does not have the abiding backing of the ruling elites, and wanted to ensure a bigger standing amongst the 'people'. the tie-up with the left and the common minimum programme made it even more suspect among corporates and mercantile groups. this is why the congress tried to rebuild a base amongst the poor through mgnrega and farm loan waivers. yet, the government itself was run by people who were deeply pro-corporate and pro-market. they were needed for the congress to be able to build bridges with the new ruling elites of india, especially the mercantile classes and castes. many of these former ministers are now part of the rebel g-23 camp. even old-school 'socialist' ministers moved 'right' as they contended with babus who rose during the years when india's economy was turning right. very quickly, the sonia-led party found it difficult to control the government. the first clear glimpse of this was during the indo-us nuclear deal, which the left parties opposed. veterans of the left beat will tell you how they were convinced that a compromise had been worked out between the congress and the left parties. things suddenly fell apart when manmohan singh gave an interview to a leading newspaper, daring the left to withdraw support. the party had to unleash its minders to soothe things, but that round went to the pm. within a couple of years of the upa's return to power in 2009 with a bigger mandate, the gandhis found their authority severely pruned. cabinet reshuffles in upa-2 show that gandhi family loyalists were slowly eased out of key posts, and those who remained gradually began to assert their independence. the most prominent amongst the alternate power centres were pranab mukherjee and p chidambaram, but even junior ministers were happy to gossip against the gandhis in private conversations with journalists. the agenda of the modi office (pmo) was often at cross-purposes with the congress party's electoral strategists. one battle that sonia and her team lost was over the free ration to everyone. the party leadership wanted a big food subsidy to add to other vote-winning schemes like mgnrega and farm loan waivers. the pmo blocked it by asking its own commission to study its feasibility. even the flagship mgnrega was gradually defunded by finance minister chidambaram. this led to an open battle between chidambaram and the then rural development minister jairam ramesh who was widely seen as a rahul gandhi man. there are numerous such instances in the public domain, along with anecdotes and stories that circulate on the journalistic grapevine, that indicate that there was significant tension between 10 janpath and raisina hill. it was to explode in the public spectacle of rahul gandhi barging into a congress press conference and tearing up an ordinance being pushed by pm manmohan singh. that was the congress in power. the congress out of power has continued with the same tensions. the most visible congress leaders outside the gandhi family are former ministers, and some of them are more technocrats than politicians. p chidambaram, kapil sibal, shashi tharoor have all been key faces of the upa, and are well-known to television audiences across the country. none of them are old-school party loyalists, and they have gone against the party's writ several times, even when it was in power. right now, however, the g-23 is of no value to rahul gandhi. he realises that they cannot win him any elections because the ruling elites do not back them when they are out of power. that is why rahul is trying to build a new alliance by promoting a second-rung of leaders who have emerged from outside the english-speaking elite and their cohorts. he is gradually positioning street-savvy young leaders who have a vernacular connect. we saw one such person emerge during the second wave of covid the 40-year old former cricketer from shimoga, srinivas bv, who became a household name by arranging emergency services for covid patients. rahul has made him head of the youth congress then there are jignesh mevani and kanhaiya kumar. mevani, a dalit activist and independent mla from gujarat, has often been criticised by other dalit leaders for being too close to the left. kanhaiya kumar, the poster boy of radical student politics, is the son of an anganwadi worker. even in 2019, there were rumours that he would get a congress ticket from bihar, but things didn't work out and kanhaiya fought as a cpi candidate. he joins the congress directly from being a national executive member of the cpi. both these young firebrands have demonstrated that they have big political ambitions. yet, their youth (mevani is 40 and kanhaiya 34) will allow them to think of the long term. they will not mind listening to rahul, who is in his early 50s, or playing a supporting role in alliances with strong regional parties. they also represent a strand within india's poor who are sympathetic to backward caste and dalit politics, but do not identify with caste parties. this strategic shift is a result of pure necessity. the congress cannot compete with the bjp either in the space of getting support from the ruling elites or in building a political consensus based on a religious identity. neither can it compete with regional parties controlled by key dominant castes - sp, bsp, rjd, jd(u) or jd(s). rahul gandhi's only hope is to build a ground level network of young activists and leaders who see class as the key driver of politics. this is what is pushing rahul to the left, and increasing the distance between him and the g-23. the leaders who emerged in the 2000s are still stuck within the power networks, where the bjp rules supreme. they cannot escape it. for now, rahul has no use for them. they will only become relevant again, if a large section of india inc, who ultimately finance the game of fighting elections, lose faith in the modi government. it is then that the prominent faces of the g-23 will again be needed.

""climate change is the biggest threat to the world's reefs,"" co-author paul hardisty, ceo of the australian institute of marine science, said in a statement. oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions, shielding land surfaces but generating huge, long-lasting marine heatwaves that are pushing many species of corals past their limits of tolerance. a single so-called bleaching event in 1998 caused by warming waters wiped out eight percent of all corals. coral reefs cover only a tiny fraction -- 0.2 percent -- of the ocean floor, but they are home to at least a quarter of all marine animals and plants. besides anchoring marine ecosystems, they also provide protein, jobs and protection from storms and shoreline erosion for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. the value of goods and services from coral reefs is about $2.7 trillion per year, including $36 billion in tourism, the report said. loss of coral from 2009 to 2018 varied by region, ranging from five percent in east asia to 95 percent in the eastern tropical pacific. the 'coral triangle' ""since 2009 we have lost more coral worldwide than all the living coral in australia,"" noted unep executive director inger anderson. ""we can reverse the losses, but we have to act now."" the un's climate science advisory panel, the ipcc, projects with ""high confidence"" that global warming of 1.5 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels will see 70 to 90 percent of all corals disappear. in a 2c world, less than one percent of global corals would survive. earth's average surface temperature has already increased by 1.1c above that benchmark. the report, titled ""status of coral reefs of the world: 2020"", found reasons for cautious optimism. ""some reefs have shown a remarkable ability to bounce back, which offers some hope for the future recovery of degraded reefs,"" hardisty said. east and southeast asia's ""coral triangle"" -- which contains nearly 30 percent of the world's coral reefs -- were hit less hard by warming waters over the last decade, and in some cases showed recovery. this resilience could be due to species unique to the region, potentially offering strategies for boosting coral growth elsewhere, the authors said. based on nearly two million data points from 12,000 sites spanning 73 countries and 40 years, the report is the sixth such global survey and the first since 2008. to measure change over time, the researchers contrasted areas covered by healthy live hard coral with areas taken over by algae, a sign of coral distress.   the report was undertaken with support from unep and the international coral reef initiative, a partnership of governments and research organisations focused on preserving corals reefs and related ecosystems.

""it impacts people's ability to work, and results in lower economic output. it exacerbates pre-existing health conditions,"" he said in a statement. population growth accounted for two-thirds of the exposure spike, with actual warming temperatures contributing a third, although proportions varied from city to city, they wrote. bangladesh's capital dhaka was the worst-affected city, seeing an increase of 575 million person-days of extreme heat over the study period. that was largely attributable to its population soaring from around four million in 1983 to around 22 million today. other big cities to show similar trends were shanghai, guangzhou, yangon, dubai, hanoi and khartoum as well as various cities in pakistan, india and the arabian peninsula. major cities that saw around half of their exposure causing by a warming climate included baghdad, cairo, kuwait city, lagos, kolkata and mumbai. the authors said the patterns they found in africa and south asia, ""may crucially limit the urban poor's ability to realize the economic gains associated with urbanization."" they added that ""sufficient investment, humanitarian intervention, and government support"" would be needed to counteract the negative impact. in the united states, some forty major cities saw exposure grow ""rapidly,"" mainly in the gulf coast states of texas, louisiana, mississippi, alabama, and florida.   the study was carried out by researchers at new york's columbia, university of minnesota twin cities, the university of arizona at tuscon and the university of california, santa barbara.

""the fighting continued for several hours,"" he said, adding the sound of weapons kept him awake all night. ""they said they were after daesh (is) fighters in the area,"" rahman said. ""i don't know how many were killed or arrested but the fighting was intense."" at the scene on monday, afp saw several taliban gunmen standing guard, denying people access down the road to the property. police pick-up trucks could be seen driving towards the site, one of which came back laden with household items including furniture, a carpet and kitchen appliances. the operation took place within hours of sunday's blast, which targeted a prayer ceremony at the eid gah mosque in memory of taliban spokesman mujahid's mother, who died last week. a government cultural commission official, who asked not to be named, told afp five people died and 11 were wounded, adding the casualties included both civilians and taliban members. ""we have also arrested three people in connection with the blast,"" he said. blood trails according to the official, the device was placed at the entrance to the mosque and detonated as mourners were leaving after offering condolences to mujahid and his family. a witness at the mosque, who asked not to be identified, told afp sunday's attack at the entrance was carried out by a single suicide bomber. just outside the eastern gate, a dark patch was visible on the ground where the explosion took place and bullet holes could be seen in a wall. the witness said a group of taliban members -- including senior figures -- inside the mosque grounds came under fire after the blast, taking two casualties. he added that two taliban units mistakenly opened fire on each other in the confusion following the explosion, but interior ministry spokesman qari sayed khosti denied there had been any gunfire. ""a suicide bomber detonated his explosives among the crowd killing three people and wounding a dozen,"" he said. trails of blood into the mosque, as well as two red pools where the witness said the injured fighters were treated inside, were seen by afp reporters on monday. the taliban and the afghanistan branch of is -- known as the islamic state-khorasan province, or is-k -- are both hardline sunni islamist militant groups. but they differ on the issues of religion and strategy, which has led to bloody fighting between the two.   the united nations in afghanistan condemned sunday's mosque attack.

""this is really what we've waited for all these months,"" he said. ""there is a window of hope with this treatment, and now we need to collectively make it work for people"" in less well-to-do countries. if the new medication hits the market, it could be a turning point in the pandemic, but the global supply picture is uncertain. on the vaccine front, lower-income nations have been left behind. about nine months after the arrival of covid shots, more than 55 countries have yet to vaccinate 10% of their populations. more than two dozen nations are below 2%. the drug, known as molnupiravir, reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 50% in an interim analysis of a late-stage clinical trial, merck and partner ridgeback biotherapeutics lp said friday. seeking clearance the results were so positive that merck and ridgeback -- in consultation with independent trial monitors and the u.s. food and drug administration -- elected to stop enrolling patients and begin the process of gaining regulatory clearance. merck plans to submit the data to other regulators worldwide. the company earlier this year announced that it had signed non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for the drug with five generic manufacturers in india in a bid to accelerate availability in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies. merck said it expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by year-end, with more expected in 2022. in june, the company agreed to a $1.2 billion supply deal with the u.s. government, under which it would provide 1.7 million courses of the treatment. initial production wouldn't go far given the number of worldwide covid cases. but the drug potentially could be very cheap to manufacture, so it should be available at a low cost in developing nations, andrew hill, a senior research fellow at the university of liverpool, wrote in an email. ""this could be a major advance in the treatment of covid he said. tiered pricing merck said it plans to implement a tiered pricing approach based on world bank income criteria to reflect countries' ability to finance their health response to the pandemic.   the drug could provide an important tool for the world on top of vaccines, but manufacturing will need to be expanded and more funding is required, according to unitaid's duneton said.

""i have never done anything illegal or wrong,"" babis tweeted, calling the revelations a smear attempt aimed at influencing the election. nearly two million of the 11.9 million leaked documents came from a panamanian law firm called alcogal. alcogal has rejected accusations of shady dealings. icij's director gerard ryle said in a video accompanying the investigation that those best placed to halt such practices were the ones benefiting the most.

""unless and until we do not have critical elements in the society, society will die,"" he submitted. the lawyer said that there were many prosecutions against imam just because he had criticized the government's policies. â€œhe is not a terrorist or associated with some terrorist outfit. he has no criminal antecedents. he does not have any political agenda,â€ he told the court. special public prosecutor amit prasad said that the fundamental right to protest cannot go beyond an extent that causes problems to the public at large. he told the court that violent riots took place pursuant to imam's speech. â€œhe tried to create an anarchy by saying that there is no hope left for the muslim community and that there is no other way left,â€ mr prasad said, opposing his bail and discharge in the case.   imam is accused of offenses relating to sedition, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, imputations prejudicial to national integration, and public mischief under the indian penal code, and indulging in unlawful activities under the uapa. the delhi police had filed a charge sheet against imam in the case, in which it alleged that he allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the central government and instigated the people which led to the violence in december 2019."

""foreign secretary @harshvshringla had separate and productive meetings with delegations from tna, tpa and cwc,"" the indian high commission said in a tweet. ""he emphasised india's commitment to protecting the rights of tamils through full implementation of the 13th amendment, early convening of provincial council elections, achieving reconciliation and establishing connectivity to india,"" it added. mr shringla earlier said that with the easing of the covid situation in sri lanka, it may be opportune for the two sides to work on connectivity initiatives like the jaffna to chennai flight, ferry services between karaikal and kankesanthurai and dhanushkodi and talaimanar, and the buddhist corridor with the new international airport at kushinagar. india has been consistently calling upon sri lanka to fulfill its commitments to protect the interests of the tamil community and preserve the island nation's character as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society. the 13th amendment provides for devolution of power to the tamil community. india has been pressing sri lanka to implement the 13th amendment which was brought in after the indo-sri lankan agreement of 1987. the ruling sri lanka people's party's sinhala majority hardliners have been advocating a total abolition of the island's provincial council system established in 1987. there are nine provincial councils in sri lanka. earlier in january, external affairs minister s jaishankar during his visit to colombo spoke on the need to ensure aspirations of the minority tamils are addressed within a united sri lanka. he had underlined india's backing for lanka's reconciliation process and an ""inclusive political outlook"" that encourages ethnic harmony.   ""it is in sri lanka's own interest that the expectations of the tamil people for equality, justice, peace and dignity within a united sri lanka are fulfilled. that applies equally to the commitments made by the sri lankan government on meaningful devolution, including the 13th amendment to the constitution,"" he had said.

""china made commitments intended to benefit certain american industries, including agriculture, that we must enforce,"" us trade representative katherine tai said in a speech monday. however the point of the negotiations in the coming days is ""not to inflame trade tensions with china,"" tai said at the center for strategic and international studies, a washington-based think tank. she also warned that president joe biden's administration is ""prepared to deploy all tools and explore the development of new ones"" to ""protect ourselves against the waves of damage inflicted over the years through unfair competition."" tai announced the launch of ""a targeted tariff exclusion process"" for exemptions from customs tariffs imposed on $370 billion worth of chinese goods a year implemented under former president donald trump. the punitive tariffs, imposed in retaliation for chinese trade practices deemed ""unfair,"" are criticized by many companies. in august influential us business groups urged biden to reduce the surcharges, pointing out that american industries faced ""increased costs"" as the tariffs are paid by importers. a senior us official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the tariffs ""will remain in place"" for the duration of the exemption procedure. biden, who took office in january, asked tai to conduct a comprehensive review of us trade strategy towards china and the tariffs initiated by trump. ""we continue to have serious concerns with china's state-centered and non-market trade practices"" that were not addressed in the ""phase one"" agreement signed early last year to calm a trade war between the countries, tai said. ""as we work to enforce the terms of phase one, we will raise these broader policy concerns with beijing."" the deal signed by trump and tai's opposite number, vice premier liu he, committed beijing to adding an extra $200 billion in purchases of us exports, including energy, agricultural and manufactured products through 2021. that is far from happening, trade analysts say. the biden administration official did not specify the extent of the shortfall, while indicating that washington is unsatisfied. ""there are some commitments that have not been met and we think the results overall of the agreement have been mixed,"" the official said, while stressing the us objective ""is not to escalate trade tension."" - 'work with our allies' - tai's speech highlighted the administration's strategy of teaming up with allied democracies in its competition with china. trump, who rejected traditional us alliances, sparked worldwide market anxiety with his trade war. however, he ended up producing limited concrete results, let alone progress on the deep-seated problems that the united states and its allies say plague their trade ties with china. these include massive state subsidies for national companies, intellectual property theft and other factors creating a heavily uneven playing field. ""the core of our strategy is a commitment to ensuring we work with our allies to create fair and open markets,"" tai said. tai also stressed that the us-china trade relationship ""is one of profound consequence."" ""as the two largest economies in the world, how we relate to each other does not just affect our two countries. it impacts the entire world and billions of workers."" overall, washington sees a bleak outlook, with the administration official saying ""we know that china is unlikely to make meaningful reforms right now"" and that there is no push for starting long-awaited phase two negotiations. ""beijing is increasingly explicit that it is doubling down on its authoritarian, state-centric approach, and is resistant to addressing our structural concerns,"" the official said. ""we recognize that china simply may not change and that we have to have a strategy that deals with china as it is, rather than as we might wish it be,"" they added. president of the national foreign trade council jake colvin said tai's remarks indicate ""the biden administration recognizes that decoupling is not an option"" for the rival nations.   he called it ""encouraging"" to see ""the outlines of a comprehensive strategy to engage china firmly and directly while giving american businesses and workers the tools they need to compete effectively in the global marketplace.""

""on the climb to mount breithorn, the twins were also accompanied by two more indian women who are not professional mountaineers. we hope that india's representation in this peak challenge will inspire more women to try out the outdoor life by participating in high-altitude hikes, mountain biking and climbing or camping. because we truly believe that there is no mountain a woman cannot scale, in the world or in her life!"" continued ms sharma.   the twins also attempted their first ever multi-pitch ascent on riffelhorn, which is at an elevation of 9,603 ft. the steep bolted routes, slippery rock and exposed sections pose different challenges in themselves and give the peak a climbing grade of 4a. apart from the climb, the twins also indulged in few fun activities like jet-boating in interlaken, gliding across the dragon slider on mount pilatus, and visiting the swiss museum for transport in lucerne."

""we continue to work with international partners, including india, to roll out our phased approach,"" a uk government spokesperson said. the uk's new system covers over 50 countries, including the us and european union (eu) member-nations plus 18 others such as canada, japan and the uae. travellers from these countries can now travel to england without needing to complete a pre-departure test, a day 8 test or enter a 10-day self-isolation period. they require just a single pcr test on the second day after arrival in the uk.

""the uk is continuing to work on expanding the policy to countries and territories across the globe in a phased approach. we are continuing to engage with the government of india on technical cooperation to expand uk recognition of vaccine certification to people vaccinated by a relevant public health body in india,â€ sources said. ""we are working with an array of international partners and look forward to continuing the expansion of the policy to countries and territories across the globe in a phased approach. extension of vaccine certification will be reviewed approximately every three weeks,â€ they added. the first three-week review mark since the uk's updated travel norms were first announced falls later this week. ""we are accelerating towards a future where travel continues to reopen safely and remains open for good, and today's rule changes are good news for families, businesses and the travel sector,â€ uk transport secretary grant shapps said on monday. ""our priority remains to protect public health but, with more than 8 in 10 people now fully vaccinated, we are able to take these steps to lower the cost of testing and help the sector to continue in its recovery,â€ he said. all arrivals into the uk, from any country, continue to be required to fill in a passenger locator form ahead of travel. meanwhile, the uk's travel industry has welcomed the government's latest move on easing testing and quarantine restrictions. tim alderslade, chief executive of airlines uk, which represents uk carriers, said: ""things are moving in the right direction and the removal of these restrictions will make it easier and cheaper for people to travel."" however, he said the uk remained ""an outlier on arrivals testing for vaccinated passengers"". airlines uk hopes to see more countries removed from the red list at the next update and further mutual recognition of vaccine status for those jabbed in other countries, he was quoted as saying by the bbc. willie walsh, head of industry body the international air transport association, welcomed the change as a ""positive step"", saying the government's testing and quarantine restrictions had been both unscientific and costly.

""as afghan women and men take to the streets during this time of great uncertainty in their country to press peacefully for their human rights to be respected ... it is crucial that those in power listen to their voices,"" it said. women like taranom seyedi said they were scared to continue to demonstrate. the 34-year-old women's rights activist in kabul who helped organise some of the protests there said she had received letters saying the taliban had made a list of all the women who protested and would conduct house searches for them. she does not know who sent the letters, but has erased protest-related content from her social media accounts as a precaution, and said others had done so too. sadat went further. ""since my participation in the protest, i've had to relocate twice ... my family is terrified, and even my neighbours are concerned and urging me not to join."" others spoke of pushback from those close to them, including zulaikha akrami, a 24-year-old international relations graduate who worked at a foreign non-profit organisation in the northeastern province of badakhshan.

""don't be afraid of going to jail"" he said, ""you will become leaders that way."" earlier a farmer had been killed and several injured after an officer of the haryana government was filmed saying that his men should ""break heads"" of protesting farmers. and yesterday, chief minister khattar was brazenly instructing his party men to unleash violence against farmers. a case should be filed against him for inciting violence. in any other country, in the wake of such chilling brutality as in lakhimpur, the head of the national government would at least have issued a statement of regret or even condolence. even donald trump, known for his racist bigotry, expressed his condolences to the family of george floyd, albeit four days after the brutal killing. but 'howdy modi has maintained a deafening silence as though it does not concern him or his government. the silence of the home minister amit shah is equally shocking. just a few days ago, both these leaders were showering praise on the adityanath government for its imaginary successes, but in the face of this shocking atrocity, they now have nothing to say. this itself is a message of support from the very top leaders of the government. the farmers of india have struggled for their right to be heard for the last ten months. their demand to be consulted before any laws are made in their name, and to withdraw the three laws made in their name without their consent is important not just to protect their interests but as a principal of democratic governance. their movement is historic in its peaceful nature, its unity and its sacrifice. the bjp is getting desperate in the face of the growing support to farmers and its political implications and impact. the horrific killings in lakhimpuri kheri only underline the need for expressions of solidarity with the farmers by each citizen of india.   brinda karat is a politburo member of the cpi(m) and a former member of the rajya sabha. disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same."

One Startup Experiments To Draw Talent,"a shortage of technology talent has indian companies offering sweeteners like more vacation time and gender-neutral parental leave as they compete for graduates and professionals. one bengaluru startup is trying a more dramatic solution: a three-day work week. fintech company slice is offering new hires a three-day week with salary at 80% of the going market rate. this is a win-win approach that frees the workers to pursue other passions or interests -- or other gigs -- while still locking in a steady pay and benefits from slice, said rajan bajaj, the company's founder. ""this is the future of work,"" mr bajaj, 28, said in a phone interview. ""people don't want to be tied down to a job."" global investors are pouring billions of dollars into tech startups in the country, putting entrepreneurs under pressure to ramp up teams. a massive talent crunch has ensued as it outsourcers, silicon valley giants, global retailers and wall street banks' technology centers vie for engineering and product talent alongside hundreds of fast-growing startups. slice is betting that its approach will make it stand apart from the competition. the company has 450 employees and wants to recruit 1,000 engineers and product managers in the next three years. ""it's the best of both worlds,"" mr bajaj said. ""workers can get salary and full benefits working a three-day week, and spend the rest of their time chasing a startup dream, looking for a co-founder or pursuing a non-work passion."" the move toward shorter weeks has been underway for at least a century. in 1926, henry ford adopted a five-day work week in place of the typical six days, after experiments showed productivity wouldn't suffer as a result. companies and countries have experimented with four-day weeks for years without widespread adoption. proponents of shorter weeks now point to studies showing a boost in employee productivity and well-being, prompting countries such as ireland and iceland to try them out. technology behemoth amazon.com inc. piloted a four-day week for select employees in 2018, and even china is trying to rein in its excessive working hours. just as in silicon valley, the indian startup industry's work-centered culture is leaving some engineers disenchanted while some are milking the opportunity for all its worth. engineers' salaries have tripled in the past three years, mr bajaj said. bidding wars are common and workers are known to ghost startups after multiple rounds of pay negotiations. founders joke on social media about advertising on matchmaking and food delivery apps to obtain workers. such is the hiring bonanza that bhavish aggarwal, founder of ride-hailing startup ola and electric-car startup ola electric mobility pvt., tweeted recently in half jest that he was thinking of outsourcing work to a cheaper destination -- the san francisco bay area. flush with capital, startups are also spending on other initiatives to attract engineers and designers. social commerce platform meesho announced a companywide 10-day break in november so workers can unplug and rejuvenate. fintech startup bharatpe has proffered referral goodies like bmw bikes, gadgets and cricket holidays in dubai. slice began offering its three-day option on monday, and it is betting its timing is opportune: millions of engineers are preparing to return to in-person work, after nearly two years of being confined to working from home. the startup, founded in 2016, specializes in offering credit cards to the young across the country. its physical card launched in 2019 with the company touting sign-ups of less than a minute, cashbacks and multiple payment options. slice issued 110,000 cards last month, making it among the country's top providers. its backers include japan's gunosy capital and india's blume ventures.   the new hires will form small teams and work on newer cryptocurrency or ""buy now pay later"" products. existing employees are eligible for the program ""provided they are a fit,"" mr bajaj said. ""a three-day work week allows us to recruit a certain caliber of talent because it's a perk big tech companies like google and amazon don't offer,"" he said. "

""this is just a set of largely unsubstantiated claims,"" kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said of the leaks. ""we didn't see anything on hidden wealth within putin's inner circle,"" peskov said, adding it was not clear ""how this information can be trusted"". the leaks reveal that the $4 million monaco property was purchased through an offshore company towards the end of 2003 for the woman -- a native of putin's hometown saint petersburg -- who was previously reported to have had a relationship with him. russian investigative outlet proekt reported in november last year that the woman, svetlana krivonogikh, had at one point worked as a cleaner, and was the mother of putin's child. the purchase of the property went ahead shortly after krivonogikh reportedly gave birth, the leaks showed. the media consortium said krivonogikh had not responded to requests for comment. graft reporters silenced proekt last year described krivonogikh as an elusive millionaire who lives in russia's former imperial capital and is the recipient of expensive gifts from kremlin-connected individuals. it said facial-recognition analysis of photographs obtained by their reporters showed krivonogikh's daughter bears a close resemblance to putin. the investigative outlet was earlier this year declared an ""undesirable organisation"" by authorities as part of a broader crackdown on dissenting voices, banning its work in russia under the threat of jail time. putin has guarded his private life jealously and once famously told journalists to keep their ""snotty noses"" out of his business. he divorced his wife lyudmila in 2013. the icij found links between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials, including more than a dozen serving heads of state and government. more than two-thirds of the companies were set up in the british virgin islands. the kremlin, however, said the leaks were evidence of illicit action in the united states. ""the only thing that actually catches the eye is the demonstration of which state is the world's biggest offshore and tax lacuna. and, this is, naturally, the united states,"" peskov said. the pandora leaks also revealed that the head of a state-run television network, konstantin ernst -- who oversaw the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 winter olympics -- was gifted a stake in a billion dollar moscow property deal. the kremlin has grown accustomed to rebuffing claims of corruption among the political elite. the country's most prominent opposition figure alexei navalny over the last decade has grown a loyal following with detailed investigations that targeted the wealth of the kremlin's inner circle, including putin.   navalny was jailed this year on old fraud charges, but his probe into a luxurious black sea mansion allegedly gifted to putin and released after he was jailed helped spark protests.

""economic recovery plans offer a generational opportunity to put climate action, renewable energy, and sustainable development at the heart of cities' strategies and policies."" amid the growing population in emerging economies, demand for transport, which accounts for nearly 20 per cent of global carbon emissions, is also multiplying. in this context, the un chief said cities are already working on this, trying to ensure that this demand is met by zero-emission vehicles and public transit.   mr guterres concluded asking for a global moratorium on internal combustion engines to underpin these efforts, saying it should happen by 2040 at the latest.

""promoters, builders and agents use manifestly arbitrary one-sided agreements that do not place customers at an equal platform with them, which offends articles 14, 15, 21 of the constitution. there have been many cases of deliberate inordinate delays in handing over possession and customers lodge complaints but the police don't register firs, citing arbitrary clauses of the agreement, the plea said. due to deliberate excessive delays in possession, real estate customers are not only suffering mental and financial injury but also a brazen violation of their right to life and livelihood, stated the pil filed through advocate ashwani kumar dubey. ""builders issue revised delivery schedules again and again and adopt arbitrary unfair restrictive trade practices. all this amounts to criminal conspiracy, fraud, cheating, criminal breach of trust, dishonestly inducing delivery of the property, dishonest misappropriation of property and violation of corporate laws,"" said the plea. it contended that many developers across the country still follow a common practice of pre-launching a project without securing requisite approvals from the authorities and term it ""soft launch"" or ""pre-launch"", thus openly violating the law, but no action has been taken against any builder till date.   ""it is necessary to state that registration of the project with the regulatory authority has been mandatory before it is launched for sale and for registration the basic pre-requisite is that the developer must have all the requisite approvals.

""i think it will be a new start in its true sense,"" he said. ""i want to take on challenges with a strong will and firm resolve to face the future."" kishida is widely considered a safe pair of hands, who commands support from his own faction within the ldp and is not expected to veer significantly from the government's existing policies. his election came after former modi yoshihide suga, who submitted his resignation on monday morning, announced he would not stand for the ldp leadership after just one year in office. shortly after the parliament vote, kishida's new cabinet was announced, with more than a dozen fresh faces but holdovers from the suga government largely populating the most important portfolios. both foreign minister toshimitsu motegi and defence minister nobuo kishi will retain their jobs. motegi is a harvard-educated political veteran who has taken the lead in negotiating key trade deals, while kishi is the brother of former modi shinzo abe. fresh faces the finance portfolio will go to shunichi suzuki, who is replacing his own brother-in-law taro aso. suzuki is also a veteran politician and the son of a former modi he has served in government before, holding both the olympics minister and environment minister posts. the cabinet includes three women, among them kishida's one-time rival for the leadership, seiko noda, who was named minister in charge of addressing japan's declining birthrate. the posts of vaccine minister and digital minister also went to women, with several members of the cabinet appointed to their first ministerial post. ""the kishida cabinet aims at balance with consideration given to major factions, young lawmakers, and neighbouring countries,"" wrote junichi makino, smbc nikko securities chief economist, in a note. ""it's the kind of cabinet formation that reflects kishida, who works not to make enemies."" kishida has also rewarded those who supported him in the leadership race, including rival sanae takaichi who backed him in the second-round vote against kono, and has been made ldp policy chief. kono meanwhile has been made party communications chairman -- something of a step down from his recent role heading the vaccine roll-out and past posts as defence and foreign minister. election looms as modi kishida faces a raft of challenges, from the post-pandemic economic recovery to confronting military threats from north korea and china. he will also lead the ldp in general elections, which local media reported would be held on october 31, a few weeks earlier than expected. the ruling party and its coalition are widely expected to retain power, but could be vulnerable to losing some seats, with the public unhappy about the government's response to the covid suga's government saw its approval ratings slump as it struggled to tackle waves of infection, including a record virus spike over the summer while the olympics were being held in tokyo. kishida's leadership campaign emphasised his plans to correct government missteps on the pandemic, including a pledge to unleash new economic stimulus. much of japan has been under virus emergency measures for a large part of the year, with the restrictions finally lifting last week as new infections decline.   more than 60 percent of the population is now fully vaccinated, but there are concerns that the healthcare system could easily become overwhelmed again in a new virus wave.

""this is really what we've waited for all these months,"" he said. ""there is a window of hope with this treatment, and now we need to collectively make it work for people"" in less well-to-do countries. if the new medication hits the market, it could be a turning point in the pandemic, but the global supply picture is uncertain. on the vaccine front, lower-income nations have been left behind. about nine months after the arrival of covid shots, more than 55 countries have yet to vaccinate 10% of their populations. more than two dozen nations are below 2%. the drug, known as molnupiravir, reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 50% in an interim analysis of a late-stage clinical trial, merck and partner ridgeback biotherapeutics lp said friday. seeking clearance the results were so positive that merck and ridgeback -- in consultation with independent trial monitors and the u.s. food and drug administration -- elected to stop enrolling patients and begin the process of gaining regulatory clearance. merck plans to submit the data to other regulators worldwide. the company earlier this year announced that it had signed non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for the drug with five generic manufacturers in india in a bid to accelerate availability in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies. merck said it expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by year-end, with more expected in 2022. in june, the company agreed to a $1.2 billion supply deal with the u.s. government, under which it would provide 1.7 million courses of the treatment. initial production wouldn't go far given the number of worldwide covid cases. but the drug potentially could be very cheap to manufacture, so it should be available at a low cost in developing nations, andrew hill, a senior research fellow at the university of liverpool, wrote in an email. ""this could be a major advance in the treatment of covid he said. tiered pricing merck said it plans to implement a tiered pricing approach based on world bank income criteria to reflect countries' ability to finance their health response to the pandemic.   the drug could provide an important tool for the world on top of vaccines, but manufacturing will need to be expanded and more funding is required, according to unitaid's duneton said. ""what we need to do is to create an affordable but quality market of generics, exactly what we did for combating aids,"" he said. ""it's feasible, it can be done."""

""facebook over and over again has shown it chooses profit over safety. it is subsidizing, it is paying for its profits with our safety,"" haugen said. ""the version of facebook that exists today is tearing our societies apart and causing ethnic violence around the world,"" she said. the world's largest social media platform has been embroiled in a firestorm brought about by haugen, who as an unnamed whistleblower shared documents with us lawmakers and the wall street journal that detailed how facebook knew its products, including instagram, were harming young girls, especially around body image. us senator richard blumenthal responded to the interview ahead of haugen's appearance to testify in congress next week, saying in a statement: ""facebook's actions make clear that we cannot trust it to police itself. we must consider stronger oversight."" in the ""60 minutes"" interview haugen explained how the company's news feed algorithm is optimized for content that gets a reaction. the company's own research shows that it is ""easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions,"" haugen said. ""facebook has realized that if they change the algorithm to be safer, people will spend less time on the site, they'll click on less ads, they'll make less money."" during the 2020 us presidential election, she said, the company realized the danger that such content presented and turned on safety systems to reduce it. but ""as soon as the election was over they turn them back off, or they change the settings back to what they were before, to prioritize growth over safety, and that really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me,"" she said. ""no one at facebook is malevolent,"" she said, adding that co-founder and ceo mark zuckerberg did not set out to make a ""hateful"" platform. but, haugen said, the incentives are ""misaligned."" 'ludicrous' facebook's vice president of policy and global affairs nick clegg vehemently pushed back at the assertion its platforms are ""toxic"" for teens, days after a tense congress hearing in which us lawmakers grilled the company over its impact on the mental health of young users. while haugen did not draw a straight line between the decision to roll back safety systems and the us capitol riot on january 6, ""60 minutes"" noted that the social network was used by some of the organizers of that violence. during an appearance on cnn, clegg dismissed the link. ""i think the assertion (that) january 6th can be explained because of social media, i just think that's ludicrous,"" clegg told the broadcaster, saying it was ""false comfort"" to believe technology was driving america's deepening political polarization. polarization the new york times reported saturday that clegg sought to pre-empt haugen's interview by penning a 1,500-word memo to staff alerting them of the ""misleading"" accusations. facebook has encountered criticism that it fuels societal problems, attacks clegg said should not rest at facebook's feet. but he acknowledged that people with pre-existing issues may not benefit from social media use. he also disputed reporting in an explosive wall street journal series that facebook's own research warned of the harm that photo-sharing app instagram can do to teen girls' well-being. ""it's simply not borne out by our research or anybody else's that instagram is bad or toxic for all teens,"" clegg told cnn, but added facebook's research would continue.   facing pressure, the company had previously announced it would suspend but not abandon the development of a version of instagram meant for users younger than 13.

""accordingly, all structured products relating to the company will also be halted from trading at the same time."" shares in its electric vehicle company, which last week scrapped a proposed shanghai listing, were not suspended, though they fell six percent in early trade. officials at the firm have been struggling to deal with a crisis that has left it more than $300 billion in debt, fuelling fears of a contagion for the wider chinese economy that some warn could spread globally. last week it said it will sell a $1.5 billion stake in a regional chinese bank to raise much-needed capital, as it struggles to make interest payments to bondholders. beijing has stayed silent on the travails of the property empire, but state media has trailed various responses in a nod to the mood towards a private company that grew on a debt binge in the boom years of chinese real estate. authorities have asked local governments to prepare for evergrande's potential collapse, according to reports, suggesting a major state bailout is unlikely. the liquidity crunch has triggered public anger and rare protests outside its offices in china as investors and suppliers demand their money back. the group has admitted to facing ""unprecedented challenges"" and warned that it may not be able to meet its liabilities.   the country's real estate sector has been under tightened scrutiny in recent months, with regulators announcing caps for three different debt ratios in a scheme dubbed ""three red lines"" last year.

""i departed india 43 years ago, but india has never left me. i am still a vegetarian; i don't smoke or drink alcohol beyond a few sips of wine; i have a puja alcove in my home where i light my lamp every day - and, as much as i love the new york yankees and american tv shows, i can't resist watching ipl cricket, kaun banega crorepati, indian movies and indian idol,"" she writes. ""they all bring me home to my wonderful upbringing in madras, and to the energy and rhythms that are so familiar and precious to me,"" she adds. ms nooyi finds these shows acting as a window into how india has changed since she was a teenager who dared play nancy sinatra's ""these boots are made for walkin"" in a rock 'n' roll band. she writes that today's popular media features characters and performers who are strong, educated and determined women making their way in the world, and these shows help young girls understand how they, too, have a voice and can dream of forging an independent life. she also says that she sees plenty of women playing traditional roles that were the norm many decades ago, both on tv and in real life. ""they are deferential, attentive, taking care of everyone, engaged in unpaid labour. i'm reminded that, when it comes to women, india has one foot in the future and one foot in the past,"" she writes. as ms nooyi traced her journey while writing this book, she says, she was in awe of how india has passed so many ""intelligent laws to protect its citizens"", and how many of these focus on women. but, she adds that she then ran into a few more facts like women accounting for only 20 per cent of the paid labour force in india, a figure that has fallen by 30 per cent in the last 20 years. ""women do almost 10 times more unpaid domestic work than men. although girls are increasingly outperforming boys in school and women now make almost half of college graduates, they fill far fewer entry-level professional jobs,"" she writes. ms nooyi says she believes that all women deserve the power to earn money, for their own sake, and for the sake of their children, their communities, and the good of the whole society. she, however, rues that statistics reveal the gap between the law and reality. ""the needle will only move if leadership at all levels commits to improving the situation for all women, including timely justice for those who have often been left behind in rural india and in unorganised sectors of the economy,"" the epilogue says. ms nooyi is of the opinion that as india emerges from the devastating impact of covid it must rethink some of its economic priorities under the umbrella of ""atmanirbhar bharat"". ""i hope whole new ecosystems around next-generation industries emerge, and new investments in core infrastructure, including roads, the railways, water and sanitation, and healthcare,"" she writes. when ms nooyi took over as ceo of pepsico, one of her pivotal and controversial ideas was to steer the iconic american company toward healthier products and reinvent its environmental profile. the strategy met with immense backlash from some shareholders who wouldn't stand for anything that affected the company's short-term profitability targets. in the book, ms nooyi also narrates a particular conversation in the face of tremendous resistance. when she pitched the revolutionary strategy to introduce healthy products, she was asked if she was mother teresa.   for a dozen years as one of the world's most admired ceos, ms nooyi redefined what it means to be an exceptional leader. she has been consistently ranked in forbes's ""the world's 100 most powerful women"", fortune's ""most powerful women"" and was twice named on time magazine's list of the ""100 most influential people in the world"".

""afghanistan is experiencing a serious humanitarian crisis and a socio-economic collapse is looming, which would be dangerous for afghans, the region and international security,"" borrell wrote. food prices in the country have jumped more than 50% since the taliban took power in august as the freezing of $9 billion of afghanistan's assets held in foreign central bank reserves and the withdrawal of foreign income stokes inflation. the afghan banking system is largely paralysed, with people unable to withdraw money, while the country's health system - which was heavily dependent on foreign aid - is close to collapse, according to borrell. ""if the situation continues and with winter approaching, this risks turning into a humanitarian catastrophe,"" he wrote, adding that this could trigger mass migration into neighbouring states. the 27-country eu has increased its humanitarian aid to afghanistan since the taliban took power, but halted its development assistance - a move also taken by other countries and the world bank. the eu response to the crisis would depend on the behaviour of the new afghan authorities, borrell said, and any resumption of relations would require compliance with conditions including human rights. ""this requires above all that the taliban take the steps that will enable the international community to assist the afghan people,"" he said, adding that female staff from international agencies must be able to do their job. widespread reports of human rights abuses and the exclusion of girls from schools have dented optimism that the taliban's approach has changed since it first ran afghanistan between 1996 and 2001. borrell met qatari officials last week in the qatari capital doha, where the taliban have a representation.   he said qatar's contacts with the taliban were aimed at moderating their behaviour, and urged doha to use its contacts with them to ensure the ""worst scenario"" for afghanistan could be avoided.

""the way forward for our country is not to just pull the big lever marked uncontrolled immigration, and allow in huge numbers of people to do work...so what i won't do is go back to the old failed model of low wages, low skills supported by uncontrolled immigration,"" he told bbc's andrew marr show. ""when people voted for change in 2016 and ... again in 2019 as they did, they voted for the end of a broken model of the uk economy that relied on low wages and low skill and chronic low productivity, and we are moving away from that."" it was the closest the modi has come to admitting that britain's exit from the eu had contributed to strains in supply chains and the labour force, stretching everything from fuel deliveries to potential shortages of turkeys for christmas. ""there will be a period of adjustment, but that is i think what we need to see,"" he said. but he was clear he would not open the taps of immigration to fill such gaps, again shifting the responsibility to businesses to lift wages and attract more workers. shortages of workers after brexit and the covid pandemic have sown disarray in some sectors of the economy, disrupting deliveries of fuel and medicines and leaving more than 100,000 pigs facing a cull due to a lack of abbatoir workers. conservative party chair, oliver dowden, said that the government was taking measures to hire more truck drivers in general and that the government had started training military tanker personnel to start fuel deliveries on monday. ""we will make sure that people have their turkey for christmas, and i know that for the environment secretary george eustice this is absolutely top of his list,"" he told sky news. rather than the reset johnson hoped to preside over in the northern english city of manchester, the conference looks set to be overshadowed by the supply-chain crises and criticism of the government's withdrawal of a top-up to a state benefit for low-income households. johnson may also come under fire for breaking with the conservatives' traditional stance as the party of low taxes after increasing them to help the health and social care sectors.   ""we don't want to raise taxes, of course, but what we will not do is be irresponsible with the public finances,"" he said.

""to have all men is not the vision of qatar,"" said aisha hamam al-jasim, 59, a nursing manager who ran in doha's markhiya district. she urged qatari women to start ""voicing what they believe in"" and vote for strong women candidates in future. ""for the first time in qatar, this is the opportunity to take part in the political,"" she said as people trickled into the polls earlier on saturday. jasim, like fellow female candidates, said she had encountered some men who thought women should not run. highlighting her administrative skills, she focused on policy priorities like health, youth employment and retirement. ""i just say: i'm strong, i'm capable, i see myself as fit as a man...if you want to see me as weak, that's up to you, but i am not weak,"" she said in the polling station where men and women had separate entrances. while qatar has introduced reforms to women's rights in recent years, including allowing women to independently get a driving license, it has been criticised by rights groups for issues like the guardianship system, where a woman needs male permission to marry, travel and access reproductive healthcare. human rights watch in march said that when in 2019 women tweeted from an anonymous account about qatar's guardianship system, the account shut down within 24 hours after cyber security officials summoned one woman. naima abdulwahab al-mutaawa'a, a candidate and foreign ministry worker whose elderly mother came to vote for her, had wanted to press for a body advocating for women and children. several female candidates had been seeking to improve the integration into qatari society of children of female citizens married to foreigners who, like in other gulf states, cannot pass their qatari nationality to their children. while jasim stopped short of advocating for granting passports, fellow candidate leena al-dafa called for full citizenship for children in such cases. dafa, a writer, does not see those who oppose women in the shura council as an obstacle because the ruling emir - and the law - support female participation. ""the law gives me this right...i don't care what aggressive people say about that,"" she said, adding that women were best suited to discuss their issues. al-maha al-majid, a 34-year-old industrial engineer stood for election, alongside her policies, to change mindsets. ""to convince the males (to vote for women), yes, we may have to put in work or extra effort...i'm willing to take this extra effort in order to be in and to convince this society that the women can do so,"" she said. for some, attitudes are hard to shake. male candidate sabaan al jassim, 65, supports women standing in elections but said their primary role remains in the family. ""they are here, they have their fingerprint and they have their vote and a voice...but most important is in the house, to take care of the kids with the families,"" he said at a polling station where jasim and mutaawa'a sat across the room from him.   qatar currently has only one female minister: public health minister hanan mohamed al kuwari.

""we didn't go through covid to go back to how things were before -- to the status quo ante. build back better means we want things to change and improve as we recover,"" he said. ""that means taking the big, bold decisions on the priorities people care about - like on social care, on supporting jobs, on climate change, tackling crime and levelling up."" he repeated his mantra that the government did all it could to prop up businesses during the pandemic, to protect jobs and had successfully rolled out a mass vaccination programme. but for many critics, this often repeated statement underscores a refusal to acknowledge missteps in the early days of the pandemic when the government seemed reluctant to lockdown the economy to stop the spread of the virus.   at the conference, the withdrawal of a top-up to a state benefit for low-income households and the end of a covid jobs support scheme might also attract criticism from some lawmakers, particularly those from regions in northern and central england which have traditionally supported the opposition labour party.

""what we have now is a system that allows us to control immigration, and that gives us flexibility. we can open up our markets if we need to, and of course we'll keep everything under review,"" johnson said. the government has said 200 military tanker personnel will help deliver fuel from monday.   ""what we don't want to do is go back to a situation in which we basically allowed the road haulage industry to be sustained with a lot of low wage immigration,"" johnson said.

""mohammed khalifa not only fought for isis on the battlefield in syria, but he was also the voice behind the violence,"" said acting us attorney raj parekh for the eastern district of virginia. according to the indictment, khalifa's ""primary focus"" was ""enticing isis supporters to travel to isis-controlled areas to join isis or to conduct attacks in the west, including in the united states."" the jihadist group, classified as a terrorist organization by us authorities, is responsible for a wave of deadly attacks in western countries. its emergence prompted intervention by a us-led international military coalition, which succeeded in defeating the self-proclaimed ""caliphate"" even though isis is still present in many additional countries, particularly in africa and asia, and continues to pose a threat according to us and european intelligence services. - 'glorified' murders, cruelty - in a 2019 interview with canada's cbc from his syrian prison, khalifa showed no regret for his actions. he said he wanted to return to canada with his wife and their three children, but on the condition that he would not be tried there. ""through his alleged leading role in translating, narrating, and advancing isis's online propaganda, khalifa promoted the terrorist group, furthered its worldwide recruitment efforts, and expanded the reach of videos that glorified the horrific murders and indiscriminate cruelty of isis,"" parekh said. this is the first known indictment of a foreign isis fighter in america since president joe biden took power in january. two members of the notorious isis kidnapping cell dubbed the ""beatles,"" alexanda kotey and el shafee elsheikh, are currently in the hands of us authorities after being transferred to the united states from iraq nearly a year ago. the pair are accused of involvement in the murders of foley and sotloff, as well as those of relief workers peter kassig and kayla mueller.   kotey, a former british national who was stripped of his citizenship, pleaded guilty in early september to charges of conspiring to murder the four american hostages.

""this means thailand is now welcoming travellers from any country in the world to the sandbox programme,"" it said in a statement. foreign ministry spokesman tanee sangrat said unvaccinated children would be able to travel with their vaccinated parents. the sandbox programme has already lured more than 38,000 visitors to the white sands of phuket, and generated $66.67 million. but tourism operators are lukewarm on the revival of the island's economy, where 90 percent of hotels have been shuttered. they have been pleading for the government to simplify entry requirements to increase visitor numbers. the changes will allow previously excluded indonesians and malaysians to travel to phuket. before the pandemic, malaysia was thailand's second biggest source of tourists, with more than four million travellers visiting in 2019. thai authorities hope to reopen five other destinations, including capital bangkok, using the sandbox model from the start of november, followed by 20 more locations in december once vaccination rates increase. however, travel advice from other countries discouraging would-be tourists could hamper thailand's plans to reboot the industry. britain and the us have issued travel warnings as the country grapples with a deadly third wave of the virus and low vaccination rates.   daily new case numbers are hovering at around 11,000, following a peak of 23,000 in august -- but testing levels have also declined.

""imagine if our country had not come up with a vaccine. what would be the situation? we know that a large population of the world doesn't have access to covid vaccines. today, our success in vaccination is thanks to india being atmanirbhar,"" pm modi said in an interview to open magazine. sixty-nine per cent of the country's adult population has received at least one dose of covid vaccine and 25 per cent has taken both doses, the government said earlier this week. it aims to inoculate all eligible population by december-end. pm modi said most people only level allegations as they lack the time to study the issue, while criticism is rooted in research. ""i, with an honest mind, respect critics a lot. but, unfortunately, the number of critics is very low. mostly, people only level allegations, the people who play games about perception are more in number. and the reason for this is that , for criticism, one has to do a lot of hard work, research and, in today's fast-paced world, may be people don't have time. so sometimes, i miss critics,"" he added. ""we need to look at the entire logistics, planning and progress to understand the success of the vaccine drive. it is a huge effort with so many people mobilised across the country. i hope the media will take time out to highlight the efforts of our people in making the world's largest vaccination drive a stunning success,"" the pm told the magazine. the modi spotlighted how at a science conference a few years ago he suggested it was time to move away from ""jai jawan, jai kisan, jai vigyan"" and work on the mantra of ""jai jawan, jai kisan, jai vigyan, jai anusandhan (research)"". he said his government gives top priority to research. ""we started planning for the vaccination drive right in may 2020 when no vaccine was even close to approval anywhere in the world. we had decided as early as then that we did not want this vaccination drive to run in the old way where it could take decades to vaccinate people. we wanted this to run in a fast, efficient, discretion-free and timebound manner,"" said the modi two vaccines for covid covishield, which has been developed by british-swedish pharmaceutical company astrazeneca is manufactured in india by pune-based serum institute of india, and covaxin, developed by homegrown bharat biotech, received emergency approval from the country's drug regulator at the start of this year. elaborating his point, the modi said the poor today does not have to wait or pay a bribe to avail services he deserves. a poor migrant, said pm modi can take his second dose of vaccine in the city he works in, even if he took the first dose in his village. technology ensures he gets the right vaccine at the right time and seamlessly, the modi said. ""when we compare india's situation in the world, we have done better than many developed countries. however, we have in our midst vested interests whose only aim is to tarnish india's name. covid was a global scourge with all countries equally affected. in this scenario, india has done better that its peers and many developed countries, notwithstanding such negative campaigns,"" he said. reeling off numbers and his government's focus on healthcare, the modi said from six all india institute of medical sciences (aiims) in 2014, the nation is now building 22 such institutes; from 380 medical colleges in 2014, there are now around 560 such colleges. the government is also working on launching a massive scheme to boost health infrastructure that will address a lot of legacy issues, said the modi ""we are actively focusing on preventive healthcare. from improved sanitation to water supply, from yoga to ayurveda, from strengthening diagnostic centres in remote areas, we are doing it all,"" he stressed. pm modi credited the country for its ability to unite, come together and deliver in this hour of grave crisis. ""from being a net importer of ppe kits, we have now become one of the biggest manufacturers across the globe. similarly, we not only managed to exponentially increase the number of ventilators but also did so largely through domestic manufacturing. india achieved this despite limited global knowledge about the virus, the economic impact of lockdown and existing state capacity constraints. is there any better evidence of our ability to bring transformative change?"" asked pm modi   on the criticism against the banging of thalis and lighting diyas, the modi said there was a need to boost the morale of healthcare and frontline workers. he said the event turned into a big mass movement.

""the flyby was flawless from the spacecraft point of view, and it's incredible to finally see our target planet,"" said elsa montagnon, spacecraft operations manager for the mission. the bepicolombo mission will study all aspects of this mysterious inner planet from its core to surface processes, magnetic field and exosphere, ""to better understand the origin and evolution of a planet close to its parent star"", said the agency. mercury is also the only rocky planet orbiting the sun beside our own to have a magnetic field. magnetic fields are generated by a liquid core but given its size, mercury's should have grown cold and solid by now, as mars did. this anomaly might be due to some feature of the core's composition, something bepicolombo's instruments will measure with much greater precision than has been possible so far. on its surface, mercury is a planet of extremes, vacillating between hot days of about 430 degrees celsius (more than 800 degrees fahrenheit) to super-frosty nights of minus 180c (minus 290f). those days and nights last nearly three earth months each. earlier missions have detected evidence of ice in the deepest recesses of the planet's polar craters. scientists speculate that this may have accumulated from comets crashing onto mercury's surface. bepicolombo is due to make five more flybys of mercury during a complex trajectory that will also see the satellite fly past venus and earth. it could not be sent directly to mercury, as the sun's pull is so strong that a huge braking manoeuvre would be needed to place the satellite successfully, requiring too much fuel for a spacecraft of this size. the mission will last for around another five years.   the gravity exerted by the earth and venus -- known as gravitational assist -- allows it to slow down 'naturally' during its journey.

""the experts have been saying that children are most vulnerable and in tea gardens they are most, so the government thought that it has to focus on children nutrition and immunity,"" said assam's tea tribe welfare minister sanjoy kishan said. assam has 33 lakh children. according to national family health survey (nfhs) 2019-20, 9.1 per cent, 1 out of 10 children under the age of 5 are suffering from severe acute malnourishment or sam. three out of 10 (32.8%) children are underweight; 6 out of 10 (65.9%) females between the age of 15 to 49 suffer from anaemia. ""we leave home early morning, we cant keep track of what our children are eating, with meagre pay we cant ensure nutrition and we get back home late evening. without good food our children have low immunity,"" said anjana jaal, a tea garden worker at tinsukia's chandmari tea estate. the vaccination status in assam's 800 tea gardens is additional cause of concern --- of 10 lakh workers, only 55,000 have got both doses, while 6.5 lakh have got just one. non-vaccinated minors, with low immunity in the tea gardens, have higher exposure to the virus -- so, the poshan maah drive's spotlight is on them.

""women are humans, we are full humans, and we need to be treated like full humans,"" said laura bushwitz, a 66-year-old retired teacher from florida, wearing a dress with portraits of women activists and politicians, like michelle obama. ""we should be able to have our own choice on what we want to do with our bodies. period,"" she said. ""hear that, scotus,?"" she asked, referring to the us supreme court. the court has already refused to block the texas law and has agreed to review a restrictive mississippi law that could provide an opportunity to overturn the 1973 roe v wade precedent, that guaranteed the legal right to an abortion up until a fetus is viable outside the womb. rallies were planned in at least two conservative states' capitals, austin and jackson, as well as in more than 600 cities in all 50 states. according to the organizers, nearly a quarter million people are expected to turn out across the united states. ""together, we are joining hands to advocate for a country where abortion isn't just legal -- it's accessible, affordable and destigmatized,"" said the organizers of the rally for abortion justice in a statement. the group called on congress to enshrine the right to abortion in federal law, to protect it from any possible reversal by the supreme court. a bill to that effect was adopted a week ago in the house of representatives, which is controlled by democrats, but has no chance of passing the senate where republicans have enough votes to block it. 'patriarchal desire' in 2017, a first ""women's march"" was held the day after trump's inauguration, rallying millions of opponents of the republican billionaire who had been accused of sexism. since then, other demonstrations have failed to turn out such huge numbers, in part due to internal divisions over accusations of anti-semitism leveled at one of the organizers. but that page seems to have been turned. saturday's participants are a broad coalition including small feminist groups, community and local organizations as well as the giant of family planning, planned parenthood. ""we're taking to the streets once again, for the first time in the (joe) biden era,"" the statement said. ""because a change in the oval office hasn't stopped the politicized, perverse, and patriarchal desire to regulate our bodies. if anything, it's only gotten even more intense."" that escalation has been spurred on by trump's appointment of three conservative justices to the supreme court, emboldening local conservative elected officials across to the country to embark on an anti-abortion offensive. so far this year, 19 states have adopted 63 laws restricting access to abortions. if the high court were to overturn roe v. wade, every state would be free to ban or allow abortions.   that would mean 36 million women in 26 states -- nearly half of american women of reproductive age -- would likely lose the legal right to an abortion, according to a planned parenthood report released friday.

""and intelligence that supports them comes from a variety of sources, and not just us boots on the ground."" austin's remarks came about two weeks after the pentagon chief was forced to apologize to the relatives of civilians killed in an august 29 drone strike in kabul. the target of the drone strike was suspected is terrorists but it ended up killing 10 civilians, including seven children, in what austin called a ""horrible mistake."" it was the latest in a long line of us drone strikes that caused civilian casualties in afghanistan, becoming one of the most contentious issues over the 20-year war and prompting harsh criticism from afghans. in his congress testimony, austin declined to publicly divulge much about the pentagon's ""over-the-horizon"" plans, telling committee members he could provide more details in a closed classified session. 'good luck' a number of experts and lawmakers expressed skepticism about the efficacy of long distance strikes on land-locked afghanistan, which is thousands of miles (kilometers) from the nearest us base. ""kill terrorists in afghanistan from 'over the horizon'? good luck,"" headlined an article by james holmes, a professor of maritime strategy at the naval war college. ""over-the-horizon operations work well when the battlefield lies within easy reach of sea or air forces,"" holmes said in the piece published on the national security website 19fortyfive.com. ""land-based aircraft flying from persian gulf airstrips must detour southward around hostile iranian airspace, into the arabian sea, and northward through pakistani airspace to strike targets in afghanistan,"" said holmes, a former us navy officer. ""carrier aircraft have it easier from a distance standpoint since their mobile airfield can linger in the arabian sea,"" he added. ""but even so, the afghan capital of kabul lies close to 700 miles from the closest point along the pakistani seacoast,"" holmes said. ""inflight refueling will be a must."" 'a fiction' mike waltz, a republican lawmaker from florida, accused biden and austin of peddling a ""fiction"" when it came to ""over-the-horizon"" capability. unlike in iraq, where us troops fought is with iraqi government forces, or syria, where americans partnered with kurdish fighters, the united states does not have any allies on the ground in afghanistan or any nearby bases, waltz said.   ""those drones have to fly all the way around iran, all the way up pakistan and lose 70 to 80 percent of their fuel before they even get anywhere near a target,"" said waltz, a former us army green beret who served in afghanistan. ""the president of the united states is selling this country a fiction that we can do over here with nothing,"" waltz said, pointing to afghanistan on a map, ""what we're doing over here (in iraq and syria) with neighboring bases access, with allies on the ground and with ocean access."" ""that is a fiction that you all need to own,"" he added. in the early 2000s, the united states had military bases in uzbekistan, tajikistan and kyrgyzstan, but it is no longer present in central asia, which russia considers its sphere of influence. general mark milley, the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff, told lawmakers that he met recently in europe with his russian counterpart, general valery gerasimov. ""in the main, we're not asking permission -- negotiating, i guess, is the word,"" milley said. ""president (vladimir) putin and president biden had a conversation and i was following up on that conversation,"" he said. andy kim, a democratic lawmaker from new jersey, asked austin, the pentagon chief, whether us overflights of afghanistan were legal.   ""yes,"" austin replied, adding that he would provide further details in a classified setting. the taliban this week accused the united states of violating international law with drone flights over afghan territory and warned of ""negative consequences"" if they continued."

""china has been bellicose and damaging regional peace while engaging in many bullying acts,"" premier su tseng-chang told reporters saturday. ""it's evident that the world, the international community, rejects such behaviours by china more and more."" taiwan's defence ministry said it scrambled its aircraft to broadcast warnings after 22 fighters, two bombers and one anti-submarine aircraft entered the island's southwest adiz on friday. a second batch of 13 jets then crossed into taiwan's adiz later on friday, in a rare night incursion, bringing the total to a record 38, according to the ministry. that was followed by a further incursion on saturday by 20 planes. the adiz is not the same as taiwan's territorial airspace but includes a far greater area that overlaps with part of china's own air defence identification zone and even includes some of mainland china. rising tensions mass incursions used to be rare. but in the last two years beijing has begun sending large sorties into taiwan's adiz to signal dissatisfaction at key moments -- and to keep taipei's ageing fighter fleet regularly stressed. last week, 24 chinese warplanes flew into the area after taiwan applied to join a major trans-pacific trade pact. friday's show of force came the same week beijing accused britain of ""evil attentions"" after it sent a frigate to sail through the taiwan strait. china claims the strait as its own waterway, along with most of the disputed south china sea. most other nations view them as international waters open to all. beijing has ramped up pressure on taipei since the 2016 election of president tsai ing-wen, who has said she views the island as ""already independent"" and not part of a ""one china"". last year, chinese military jets made a record 380 incursions into taiwan's defence zone, and the number of breaches for the first nine months of this year has already exceeded 500. the previous single-day record was on june 15 when 28 jets breached taiwan's adiz. xi has described taiwan becoming part of the mainland as ""inevitable"". us military officials have begun to talk openly about fears that china could consider the previously unthinkable and invade. protection of taiwan has become a rare bipartisan issue in washington and a growing number of western nations have begun joining the united states in ""freedom of navigation"" exercises to push back on china's claims to the south china sea and taiwan strait. britain sent a warship through the taiwan strait on monday for the first time since 2008. the chinese people's liberation army's eastern theatre command accused britain of acting out of ""evil intentions to sabotage peace and stability in the taiwan strait"". alexander huang, associate professor at tamkang university in taipei, said he believed the latest aerial incursion was not just about sending a message to taiwan.

""they killed him as he is the leader and all rohingya abide by him,"" habib ullah said. before opening fire, ""they said he cannot be a leader of rohingya and there cannot be any leaders for rohingya,"" he said. reuters could not independently verify his account. arsa said in a post on twitter on friday that it was ""shocked and saddened"" by the killing and decried ""finger-pointing with baseless and hearsay accusations"". more than a million rohingya live in the camps, the vast majority having fled neighbouring myanmar during a military crackdown after the coup that the united nations has said was carried out with genocidal intent.   myanmar denies committing genocide, saying it was waging a legitimate campaign against insurgents who attacked police posts.

""this means thailand is now welcoming travellers from any country in the world to the sandbox programme,"" it said in a statement. foreign ministry spokesman tanee sangrat said unvaccinated children would be able to travel with their vaccinated parents. the sandbox programme has already lured more than 38,000 visitors to the white sands of phuket, and generated $66.67 million. but tourism operators are lukewarm on the revival of the island's economy, where 90 percent of hotels have been shuttered. they have been pleading for the government to simplify entry requirements to increase visitor numbers. the changes will allow previously excluded indonesians and malaysians to travel to phuket. before the pandemic, malaysia was thailand's second biggest source of tourists, with more than four million travellers visiting in 2019. thai authorities hope to reopen five other destinations, including capital bangkok, using the sandbox model from the start of november, followed by 20 more locations in december once vaccination rates increase. however, travel advice from other countries discouraging would-be tourists could hamper thailand's plans to reboot the industry. britain and the us have issued travel warnings as the country grapples with a deadly third wave of the virus and low vaccination rates.   daily new case numbers are hovering at around 11,000, following a peak of 23,000 in august -- but testing levels have also declined.

""imagine if our country had not come up with a vaccine. what would be the situation? we know that a large population of the world doesn't have access to covid vaccines. today, our success in vaccination is thanks to india being atmanirbhar,"" pm modi said in an interview to open magazine. sixty-nine per cent of the country's adult population has received at least one dose of covid vaccine and 25 per cent has taken both doses, the government said earlier this week. it aims to inoculate all eligible population by december-end. pm modi said most people only level allegations as they lack the time to study the issue, while criticism is rooted in research. ""i, with an honest mind, respect critics a lot. but, unfortunately, the number of critics is very low. mostly, people only level allegations, the people who play games about perception are more in number. and the reason for this is that , for criticism, one has to do a lot of hard work, research and, in today's fast-paced world, may be people don't have time. so sometimes, i miss critics,"" he added. ""we need to look at the entire logistics, planning and progress to understand the success of the vaccine drive. it is a huge effort with so many people mobilised across the country. i hope the media will take time out to highlight the efforts of our people in making the world's largest vaccination drive a stunning success,"" the pm told the magazine. the modi spotlighted how at a science conference a few years ago he suggested it was time to move away from ""jai jawan, jai kisan, jai vigyan"" and work on the mantra of ""jai jawan, jai kisan, jai vigyan, jai anusandhan (research)"". he said his government gives top priority to research. ""we started planning for the vaccination drive right in may 2020 when no vaccine was even close to approval anywhere in the world. we had decided as early as then that we did not want this vaccination drive to run in the old way where it could take decades to vaccinate people. we wanted this to run in a fast, efficient, discretion-free and timebound manner,"" said the modi two vaccines for covid covishield, which has been developed by british-swedish pharmaceutical company astrazeneca is manufactured in india by pune-based serum institute of india, and covaxin, developed by homegrown bharat biotech, received emergency approval from the country's drug regulator at the start of this year. elaborating his point, the modi said the poor today does not have to wait or pay a bribe to avail services he deserves. a poor migrant, said pm modi can take his second dose of vaccine in the city he works in, even if he took the first dose in his village. technology ensures he gets the right vaccine at the right time and seamlessly, the modi said. ""when we compare india's situation in the world, we have done better than many developed countries. however, we have in our midst vested interests whose only aim is to tarnish india's name. covid was a global scourge with all countries equally affected. in this scenario, india has done better that its peers and many developed countries, notwithstanding such negative campaigns,"" he said. reeling off numbers and his government's focus on healthcare, the modi said from six all india institute of medical sciences (aiims) in 2014, the nation is now building 22 such institutes; from 380 medical colleges in 2014, there are now around 560 such colleges. the government is also working on launching a massive scheme to boost health infrastructure that will address a lot of legacy issues, said the modi ""we are actively focusing on preventive healthcare. from improved sanitation to water supply, from yoga to ayurveda, from strengthening diagnostic centres in remote areas, we are doing it all,"" he stressed. pm modi credited the country for its ability to unite, come together and deliver in this hour of grave crisis. ""from being a net importer of ppe kits, we have now become one of the biggest manufacturers across the globe. similarly, we not only managed to exponentially increase the number of ventilators but also did so largely through domestic manufacturing. india achieved this despite limited global knowledge about the virus, the economic impact of lockdown and existing state capacity constraints. is there any better evidence of our ability to bring transformative change?"" asked pm modi   on the criticism against the banging of thalis and lighting diyas, the modi said there was a need to boost the morale of healthcare and frontline workers. he said the event turned into a big mass movement.

""almost 200 military tanker personnel, 100 of which are drivers, will be deployed from monday to provide temporary support as part of the government's wider action to further relieve pressure on petrol stations and address the shortage of hgv drivers,"" the government said in a news release. motorists queued at fuel pumps across britain at the beginning of the week, draining tanks and fraying tempers. the government says a lack of tanker drivers to deliver fuel and unprecedented demand is behind the crisis. demand for fuel has stabilised throughout the week and stations are gradually stocking up again, but some parts of the country still face severe shortages. ""thanks to the immense efforts of industry over the past week, we are seeing continued signs that the situation at the pumps is slowly improving,"" said business minister kwasi kwarteng. ""it's important to stress there is no national shortage of fuel in the uk, and people should continue to buy fuel as normal. the sooner we return to our normal buying habits, the sooner we can return to normal,"" he added. the military drivers were put on standby at the beginning of the week, and have since received specialised training. the government has already made a u-turn on tighter post-brexit immigration policy, offering short-term visa waivers to foreign truckers to help plug the shortfall. fuel operators, including shell, bp and esso, said there was ""plenty of fuel at uk refineries"" and expected demand to return to normal soon. but following a week of queues, drivers in many parts of the country are still unable to get fuel, stoking concern about the effects on the wider economy. critics blame government inaction on tackling shortages of lorry drivers after britain's departure from the european union in january and the pandemic, which saw many foreign truckers leave the country.   as well as fuel deliveries, the shortage has led to empty supermarket shelves and raised fears about deliveries of food and toys for christmas.

""i'm telling you, we're going to get this done,"" he told reporters after meeting with house democrats who are deeply divided on a spending spree that biden says would restore america's battered middle class. ""it doesn't matter when. it doesn't matter whether it's in six minutes, six days or six weeks, we're gonna get it done."" the unusual presidential visit follows weeks of trips by party leaders in the other direction to the white house as biden tries to get the two ambitious spending plans passed into law. one would funnel $1.2 trillion into repairing infrastructure and the other would allocate even more for education, child care, and promoting clean energy. ""these are his proposals. these are his bold ideas,"" biden's press secretary jen psaki told reporters. ""this is his plan that he's outlined: to not just rebuild our roads, our railways and bridges, and put millions of people back to work, but also to make child care, elder care, (pre-school programs) more cost effective, to address the climate crisis. and he wants to make the case directly to members."" biden's political legacy is at stake and so probably are the democrats' chances of keeping control of congress in midterm elections next year. however, on thursday, a game of chicken between moderate democrats and more leftwing members over the bills ended in stalemate. their razor-thin majority in congress means that even a few defections could prevent votes from succeeding. nancy pelosi, the leader of the fractious house democrats, pulled a vote on infrastructure friday for the second night running as congress leaders arbitrated disputes among the party's centrist and left groupings. - trust issue - the impasse on the democratic side is rooted in political differences over how much the government should spend, but also on the sheer lack of trust between competing factions. on one side, moderate senators joe manchin and kyrsten sinema -- popularly dubbed the ""manchinema"" duo -- refuse to back the proposed $3.5 trillion price tag for the social spending package. they do, however, support something more modest, with manchin proposing $1.5 trillion. they also have already voted in favor of the separate $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. over in the house, a younger, fiery generation of more leftwing representatives insists on keeping the $3.5 trillion number for social spending, or at least something close. and to maintain negotiating leverage, they are refusing to back the popular infrastructure bill, saying this can only come once they know they have a ""yes"" from the democratic-controlled senate for the social spending deal. ""if there's something else that's short of a vote, that somebody can offer me that gives me those same assurances, i want to listen to that,"" pramila jayapal, chairwoman of the congress progressive caucus, told reporters, in a hint that the left might be willing to compromise. ""but right now i'm still saying we need a vote."" psaki said the administration's outreach to congress democrats and their staff had included at least 300 phone calls or meetings since september 1. during the 2020 campaign biden repeatedly touted his dealmaking chops -- established during his four decades as a senator -- but he has made the journey up to capitol hill only rarely as president. his in-person visit was a welcome development to rank-and-file democrats who have been voicing hope he would get more deeply involved. on friday pelosi decided against trying again straight away for a vote on the infrastructure bill, amid assurances from the progressives that they would kill it. she now has the option of putting everything on ice to buy time for crafting an overall agreement on the two bills. there is no hard timeline for action on either bill, and biden will not see the lack of progress as a defeat unless it starts dragging into the election year. with a threatened government shutdown averted until december, the next urgent deadline is to raise the national debt limit ahead of the default date of october 18 -- and there is still no plan on how to accomplish it. usually this is not a complicated issue. this year, though, republicans are refusing to join democrats in granting authorization, while democrats argue they should not have to bear responsibility alone.   the standoff leaves the united states close to the cliff edge of a default on its $28 trillion debt, with the lack of progress expected to soon start raising pulses in the financial markets.

""dna tests which were immediately ordered by the investigating magistrate established a match between the genetic profile found at several crime scenes and that of the dead man,"" she added. - multiple killings - verove died by suicide in a rented apartment, leaving a written confession, a source close to the case told afp. in the most notorious case, he was suspected of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl named cecile who was found dead in the basement of the building where she lived in the 19th arrondissement of paris. police believe he grabbed her as she came out of the building's lift on her way to school and dragged her into the basement. he is also thought to have strangled a couple to death in the central marais district of the capital in 1987. over the years, investigators came to believe that the suspect may have been part of the gendarmerie -- police-like armed forces in charge of internal security -- at the time of the crimes, and established a dna profile of him. in recent months, an investigating magistrate had begun questioning around 750 gendarmes who had been deployed in the paris region at the time. one of them was verove, a 59-year-old man living in the south of france, who was sent a summons on september 24 for questioning on september 29. but he was then was reported missing by his wife on september 27 and found dead two days later in grau-du-roi, a seaside resort on the mediterranean coast, the paris prosecutor said. he was a former gendarme, who later became a police officer and then retired, she confirmed. - 'took secrets with him' - the midi libre newspaper said he had been living quietly in a residential neighbourhood in grau-du-roi for years. according to local media, verove mentioned ""past impulses"" in a letter he left behind, which he had since brought ""under control"", and said he had committed no crimes after 1997. the murder confession contained no specifics, they said. in 1986, police had published a police sketch based on witness statements that showed a man of around 25 years old, six feet tall with light-brown hair, and with visible traces of acne on his face. a lawyer for cecile's family, didier seban, thanked police for their work but also told afp that it was ""painful to know that the criminal took his secrets with him"". according to the parisien newspaper, verove is also the suspect in another murder near paris, of 19-year-old karine leroy, in 1994 in the city of meaux.

""there's nothing beautiful about it,"" grumbled jose carlos bautista martin, a pensioner of 70 who looked on agog with fellow villagers as the volcano continued to spew waves of hot lava into the air. ""all it leaves behind is black, dark lava and an intense blaze which looks as if it will go on for ever, growling as if it were the very devil himself,"" he adds of the aeroplane-like cacophany accompanying an eruption which has wrought havoc and forced thousands from their homes. tazacorte port offers a perfect vantage point for spying the mouth of the volcano which dominates the island, a popular holiday destination, as well as the heaps of ash and lava cascading down to the sea hundreds of metres below its peak. even by thursday experts estimated the debris had covered an area bigger than 25 football pitches, with concerns rising over worsening air quality in nearby residential areas since the eruption began on september 19, the volvano sending tongues of molten rock flowing out of its main cone. despite the damage to countless homes and businesses local people are coming together to show each other solidarity in a time of crisis. down in the port, fisherman jesus guillermo hernandez rodriguez, 49, defiantly hoses away sticky blackened volcanic sand which has covered his vessel. ""it is a daily job, maintaining the boats,"" sighs rodriguez, rubbing his white beard in frustration with weatherbeaten hands. even if he still tries to manage a minimum catch, most of what he does pick up ""is not edible because of the sand,"" the dark gunk sticking to what he does land. - what future? - hernandez normally lands a catch worth around 3,000 euros a month which he shares with a colleague but this past fortnight is a virtual write-off and he expects more of the same for now as he worries about the cost. he explains he operates in what is ""one of the best fishing zones in the west of the island"". but now it is covered with molten rock. the area had already been reeling from the effects of the covid and tazacorte was just keeping itself economically afloat when the eruption, the first on la palma since 1971, hit. everybody in the village knows somebody who has suffered material loss, from houses engulfed in lava, to their job in a fishing industry left all but paralysed, the same fate befalling those working in agriculture or tourism. ""my son comes back home at night and tells me, 'mum, yet another day i haven't worked as we didn't have a single table'"" to serve, nieves acosta, 56, says of her son, a waiter in a restaurant. the acosta brothers lost their home, the straw breaking the proverbial camel's back to leave her in floods of tears as she and the family battle a rising tide of other problems. ""you talk about the future -- but what future is there?,"" she sobs. ""if there is no fishing then agriculture is hit, more than hit. what will become of our children?"" - rain of ash - the eruption brought dozens of journalists and scientists to rake over the island but their excited curiosity is in stark contrast to the serious and lined faces of locals. ""here, people were happy but now they are hanging their heads,"" says cristina sanchez, who lives in the nearby commune of los llanos de aridane. the ""rain of ash"" from the volcano ""is driving me insane,"" says nieves, who works at a retirement home and who is taking a break over a coffee with jesus, a friend who has just lost his job at a banana export firm. massive swathes of banana plantations dominate the scenery in tazacorte -- exports of the fruit are one of la palma's main earners. nieves, who refuses to give her surname, says she has little hope for the future after the volcano ""destroyed everything.""   she says she just hopes that ""when it's all over people will come, that's they will all come"" and help put the shattered community back together again.

""fx (foreign exchange) reserves in cb's (central bank) vaults in kabul have depleted, the cb cannot meet ... cash requests,"" the report, seen by reuters, said. ""the biggest source of the problem is the mismanagement at the central bank prior to the taliban takeover,"" it added. shah mehrabi, chairman of the central bank's audit committee who helped oversee the bank before the taliban took over and is still in his post, defended the central bank's actions, saying it was trying to prevent a run on the local afghani currency. the extent of the cash shortage can be seen on the streets of afghan cities, where people have been queuing for hours to withdraw dollar savings amid strict limits on how much they can take out. even before the shock of the western-backed government's collapse, the economy was struggling, but the return of the taliban and abrupt end of billions of dollars in foreign aid has left it in deep crisis. prices for staples like flour have spiralled while work has dried up, leaving millions facing hunger as winter approaches. aid dries up under the previous government, the central bank relied on cash shipments of $249 million, delivered roughly every three months in boxes of bound $100 notes and stored in the vaults of the central bank and presidential palace, according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter. that money has dried up as foreign powers shy away from dealing directly with the taliban, which fought against foreign troops and the ousted government. thousands of people - many of them civilians - died. the central bank, which plays a key role in afghanistan because it distributes aid from countries like the united states, said on wednesday it had finalised a plan to meet the country's foreign currency needs. it gave no details. the hard currency crunch is making it difficult for the taliban to meet basic needs, including paying for power or dispersing salaries to government employees, many of whom have not been paid in months. afghanistan's roughly $9 billion of offshore reserves were frozen as soon as the taliban captured kabul, leaving the central bank with just the cash in its vaults. according to the report, the central bank auctioned off $1.5 billion between june 1 and aug. 15 to local foreign exchange dealers, which it said was ""strikingly high"". ""by august 15, the central bank had an outstanding liability of $700 million and 50 billion afghanis ($569 million) towards the commercial banks,"" it said, adding that this had been a major factor in emptying its coffers. afghan central bank official mehrabi said, however, that although almost $1.5 billion of auctions had been announced, the actual amount sold was $714 million. he said the central bank had ""continued its foreign exchange auction to reduce the depreciation and inflation."" money missing? the report also questioned a decision by the central bank to shift some of its reserves to provincial branches, putting it at risk as taliban made advances across the country from late 2020 in the runup to their victory. it said around $202 million was kept in these branches at the end of 2020, compared with $12.9 million in 2019, and that the cash was not moved as provinces started to fall to the insurgents. ""some money is reportedly lost (stolen) from 'some' of the provincial branches,"" the report said, without specifying how much. mehrabi said the central bank was investigating money ""stolen"" from three of its branches, although not by the taliban. he gave no further details. former central bank governor ajmal ahmady, who left the country the day after kabul fell, did not respond to emails and other messages requesting comment on his and the bank's actions in the months before the taliban returned to power. ahmady has said on twitter in recent weeks that he did his best to manage the situation, and blamed any cash shortfall on the freezing of central bank assets abroad.   in his statements, he also said the central bank had managed the economy well prior to the fall of kabul and that he felt bad about leaving staff behind but feared for his safety. he has said no money was stolen from any reserve account.

""as the president arrived in the situation room, one of the first updates he received, of course, was about the attacks on the ground in kabul,"" press secretary jen psaki said at the time. commanders on the ground and the region, using the secure communications link to the nerve center of the white house, gave biden briefings as updates rolled in. most famous the most famous photo was what then-white house photographer pete souza called ""frame 210"" taken on may 1, 2011: president barack obama and his national security team watching a live drone video beamed into a laptop and listening to a satellite-radio feed of the seal team 6 raid that killed bin laden, the mastermind of the sept. 11 attacks. the image shows obama and top advisers crammed together in a small room. air force lieutenant general brad webb, who was a one-star general and an air force tech sergeant for the secretive joint special operations command, explained in an interview how that came about. webb, who's now the three-star commander of the air education and training command, said he was told by white house staff that he wasn't authorized to have access to the president but ""you can set up your stuff. if we have a question, we'll come get you."" so webb and a tech sergeant operated a laptop in a small annex in the situation room complex to monitor the raid in pakistan. then ""everybody kind of naturally migrated,"" and ""they float in over the series of the hours,"" he said. first was then-vice president biden, who asked ""hey general, what's going on?"" ""i kind of walked him through what he can expect,"" webb said. then ""it kind of got busy,"" webb said. he said he looked around and found, ""whoa, everybody's in here,"" including obama, who let webb keep his seat. webb is seen in uniform in the center of the white house photo. ""i spent a lot of time explaining to them what was going to occur"" but ""as more people came in, i just unplugged"" the laptop headset ""so they could hear the audio."" that included the now famous ""geronimo ekia"" call sign by a commando on the ground signaling that bin laden was dead.   souza later wrote that ""the president stood up to shake hands with general webb and a few others"" but ""there was no cheering or fist-bumping. it was an oddly subdued reaction to a historic moment.""

""my resignation as premier could not occur at a worse time, but the timing is completely outside of my control,"" berejiklian told media in sydney. ""i do not want to be a distraction from what should be the focus of the state government during this pandemic, which is the wellbeing of our citizens. it always has been and always will be."" berejiklian has been one of the most prominent faces of australia's pandemic response, fronting cameras daily as the federal government was largely sidelined. a state corruption watchdog is investigating allegations including whether she favoured a former boyfriend, then a member of parliament, in the awarding of grants in his electorate. the projects included funding for the australian clay target association and the riverina conservatorium of music in wagga wagga, a small new south wales town. berejiklian denied the allegations and said the inquiry into events that occurred between 2012 and 2018 had come ""in the most challenging weeks of the most challenging times in the state's history"". since late june, sydney's over five million residents have been under stay-at-home orders, with plans to end the lockdown slated for october 11. daily case numbers have begun to decline from a peak earlier this year but the state is still reporting over 800 cases a day. the conservative leader had helmed the state since 2017, including through australia's worst bushfire season and the entirety of the pandemic. her approval ratings rocketed in late 2020 as the state managed to avoid the ravages of the first wave, but recent opinion polls had seen her support from voters dip after the arrival of the delta variant and spiralling lockdowns.   her replacement will be decided by members of the ruling liberal party.

""kerala union of working journalists is shocked to learn that the uttar pradesh police has included the reports and interviews done by siddique kappan as a journalist in the chargesheet filed against him. the action of the up police is nothing but treating journalism as a crime. this goes against the very spirit of freedom of expression guaranteed under the constitution,"" the journalists' union said in a statement today. the chargesheet - filed in april by the up police's special task force and presented before a mathura court - has still not been made available to mr kappan or his legal representatives, his lawyers have claimed. they have petitioned the trial court, seeking ""true copies of the document to the accused"". one of the articles is on the protests against the controversial citizenship law that started in december 2019 across the country and continued till the pandemic began. ""the article talks about the firing by a hindu man kapil gurjar during the shaheen bagh protests and compares this incident to the assassination of mahatma gandhi. the article also criticises the way the delhi police handled the protests,"" the chargesheet reads. the chargesheet also cites another article on the controversy over the alleged role of the nizamuddin markaz in spreading the pandemic, saying ""it has been presented as a ploy by the central government to defame the muslim community."" in the statement, the kerala union of working journalists (kuwj) requested the supreme court to intervene and ""quash the shameful act of the up police.""

1260,Fri Oct 01 19:03:18 +0000 2021,#Blog |  PK Was Set To Join The Congress. So Why Didn't It Happen? - by @arvindgunasekar https://t.co/2KzPbA64Yi https://t.co/UvThtSiu54,https://www.ndtv.com/blog/blog-why-pk-congress-plans-and-talks-have-stalled-2560290,16,212,Blog: PK Was Set To Join The Congress. So Why Didn't It Happen?,"in the middle of july this year, images went viral of political strategist prashant kishor entering rahul gandhi's residence in central delhi. it was the first indication that kishor, considered the architect of a number electoral victories, mainly of regional parties, was in talks with india's main opposition party, making for dizzying headlines. at the time, sources familiar with the developments told ndtv that the july meeting was not the first between mr kishor and the gandhis, and that both sides were working on a arrangement where ""pk"", as he is known, would not serve as a political consultant, but, in fact, formally join the congress all this was playing out weeks after pk, in an exclusive interview to ndtv, said that he was retiring as an electoral strategist. so, the fact that he was considering joining politics did not seem unviable; in fact, it seemed like a natural progression from that announcement made on ndtv. the arrangement that the congress and pk were trying to decide on, ndtv was told, was to work on 'something bigger' than just the upcoming state elections, an ambitious plan to use pk's skills to revive the faltering fortunes of the congress in the run-up the 2024 general election. and then suddenly, without explanation, things went cold. one explanation for why lies in the revelation of a former chief minister of goa, luizinho faleiro, who crossed over earlier this week from the congress to the mamata banerjee's modi congress (tmc) just months before the coastal state votes for its next government. speaking to ndtv, mr faleiro said that it was pk and his group, i-pac (indian political action committee), which had approached him to switch to mamata banerjee's party. ""of course, he had approached me. just a few days back,"" he said. at a press conference in panaji, mr faleiro was even more explicit. ""believe it or not , i never met them (mamata banerjee and her nephew abhishek banerjee). they are great leaders. but i did not meet them. i met i-pac, i met mr prashant kishor of i-pac. just before i took the decision, we had the interaction."" if mr faleiro is to be believed, pk was and is helping expand the political footprint of the tmc in areas where the congress has been enervated, even while he was in talks with the congress over reviving its fortunes. this possible conflict of interest, some in the congress say, may have contributed to a certain cooling off in pursuing matters with pk. (further evidence of the continuing deep ties between pk and the tmc surfaced when it emerged last week that prashant kishor, a native of bihar, was registered as a voter in bhabhanipur in west bengal, the constituency being contested by mamta banerjee for election to the state legislature). pk's camp, however , points out that he had registered as a voter in bhabhanipur earlier this year before the state election as a preemptive move after reports suggested that the bjp was considering a move to oust him and his outfit during the poll period from west bengal on grounds that they were outsiders. pk's outfit is also meant to be working to spearhead the tmc's push in the north east; recently, congress assam mp sushmita deb became another high-profile leader to join the tmc. there is a trust deficit, a congress source told ndtv. sources close to pk maintain that this is not quite the case, and that i-pac's continuing work with its other clients was discussed at length in his talks with the congress leadership. the reason for the pause in talks, as per these sources, is almost solely to do with a disagreement over the timing of pk's entry into the congress while the congress leadership is keen for him to join at once, and begin work on the coming assembly elections in february in states including uttar pradesh, pk is adamant that he will only join after those elections. the reason, it was argued, is that the february elections are too close at hand, not giving pk enough time to make the congress battle-ready in those states. prashant kishor reportedly told the congress top brass that he will be fully on board for all the elections after february, up until and including the big lok sabha battle in 2024. the other reason for the possible standstill in the congress talks could be reservations of some within the congress over pk's designation and mandate. a four-member congress panel (comprising priyanka gandhi vadra in place of ahmed patel, ak anthony, kc venugopal and ambika soni), meant to advise sonia gandhi on political matters, is said to have sought the views of a large section of the congress top leadership on pk's entry. while most were said to be in favour, some leaders are believed to have suggested that pk's designation and role be confined only to managing elections. this, sources close to pk maintain, runs contrary to his talks with the congress leadership, in which both sides reportedly were in favour of a more sweeping role for pk, one in which he would have been empowered to intervene in almost all aspects of decision-making within the party. regardless of the conflicting claims, it appears that for now, what was a potential headline-making partnership between india's beleaguered grand old party and a rising political upstart, has come to a standstill.

""whether a person can be compelled to provide a sample for dna in such matters can also be answered considering the test of proportionality laid down in the unanimous decision of this court in k s puttaswamy v. union of india, wherein the right to privacy has been declared a constitutionally protected right in india,"" the bench said. the top court said the courts should therefore examine the proportionality of the legitimate aims being pursued, i.e whether the same is not arbitrary or discriminatory, whether they may have an adverse impact on the person and that they justify the encroachment upon the privacy and personal autonomy of the person, being subjected to the dna test. ""when the plaintiff is unwilling to subject himself to the dna test, forcing him to undergo one would impinge on his personal liberty and his right to privacy,"" the bench said. the verdict came on an appeal filed by one ashok kumar seeking a declaration of ownership of property, left behind by late trilok chand gupta and late sona devi. he arrayed the couple's three daughters as defendants in the suit and claimed himself to be the son of trilok chand gupta and sona devi. in their written statement, the defendants denied that the plaintiff is the son of their parents (trilok chand gupta and sona devi), and as such he is disentitled from any share in their parental property. the defendants also set up an exclusive claim on the property based on the will dated april 16, 1982, executed by their late mother sona devi. during the trial, the defendants filed an application seeking to direct kumar to undergo a deoxyribonucleic acid test (dna ) and either of the defendants, to establish a biological link of the plaintiff to the defendants' parents. kumar opposed the plea and pointed out that he has produced adequate documentary evidence to support his claim.   the trial court dismissed the application saying that the plaintiff cannot be compelled to undergo the test.

""this is a clear conspiracy to end paddy procurement at msp. arrivals in haryana began on september 20 and if the government will not procure the crop till october 11, if this is not a conspiracy to end msp, then what else is it?"" he said.   farmers from different parts of the country, especially punjab, haryana and western uttar pradesh, have been protesting along the state border in delhi since november last year, demanding repeal of the three farm laws that they fear would do away with msp eventually, leaving them at the mercy of big firms. the centre has denied the allegations and offered to amend the laws after wide discussions with farmers. the centre says the farm laws are in fact beneficial for farmers as some of the provisions cut out middlemen, who exploit farmers. but the farmers have stuck to nothing less than complete withdrawal of the three laws."

""if the cleaning processes had been carried out in time, the dams and barrages would have held more water. the problem is if there is heavy rainfall in jharkhand and bihar we (bengal) have to face the consequences,"" she said. ms banerjee said that she was sad that the flood took place just before the durga puja and affected lakhs of people. she also expressed fear that the situation may deteriorate on mahalaya day before the pujas when the high tide takes place. criticising the way the modi cares fund is spent by the centre, the modi supremo, who is one of the most bitter critics of bjp requested the common people to contribute to the cm relief fund, promising them that assistance from it will reach the affected.

""three weeks before stepping down as chief minister, i had offered my resignation to mrs sonia gandhi but she had asked me to continue,"" amarinder singh said in the statement, adding the ""humiliating manner"" in which he was pushed into resigning just hours before the congress meeting, which was clearly convened to oust him, was a matter of public record. ""the world saw the humiliation and the insult heaped on me, and yet mr rawat is making claims to the contrary,"" amarinder singh said. ""if this was not humiliation, then what was it?"" earlier on friday, mr rawat had said amarinder singh's outburst that he was not treated well by the party was not true. ""it is being said that he was humiliated. i would like to clarify that the party has always given him respect and treated him with high regard,"" mr rawat told reporters, amid the spiralling crisis in the punjab congress that started with amarinder singh's resignation as chief minister. ""...born out of his stubbornness, he was of the belief that he does not need any advice from anyone, including his own mlas and minister and party leadership,"" mr rawat said, detailing the simmering tension that grew into a crisis eventually. amarinder singh yesterday told ndtv he would quit congress for humiliating him. the congress leader shocked the party when he went to meet bjp leader and home minister amit shah in delhi, raising speculation that he might join the bjp but he has ruled out joining any party, and said he met mr shah to discuss farm laws. while resigning as chief minister, however, amarinder singh had said he would keep ""options open"". in his statement, amarinder singh recalled that mr rawat himself had publicly said after meeting him that he was satisfied by the punjab government's track record on the 2017 poll promises. ""the congress in-charge of punjab had categorically stated, as recently as september 1, that the 2022 elections would be fought under captain's leadership and the high command had no intention of replacing captain. so how can he (mr rawat) now claim that the party leadership was dissatisfied with me, and if they were, then why did he deliberately keep me in the dark all this time?"" amarinder singh said in the statement. on mr rawat's remarks that amarinder singh seemed to be ""under some kind of pressure"", the former chief minister said the only pressure he had been under for the past few months was that of his own loyalty to the congress because of which he ""continued to tolerate insult after insult."" ""if the party did not intend to humiliate me, then why was navjot singh sidhu allowed to openly criticise and attack me on social media and other public platforms for months? why did the party give the rebels, led by sidhu, a free hand in undermining my authority? why was no cognizance given to the uninterrupted spree of electoral wins i handed over to the party through the four-and-a-half years i was in the saddle?"" amarinder singh said.   in yet another attack, mr rawat said amarinder singh's ""proximity"" to amit shah puts a question mark his secular credentials. amarinder singh's tactical move whose outcome is still unknown comes after persistent gnawing by a section of congress mlas seeking a leadership change in the state ahead of assembly election next year. just two months ago navjot singh sidhu was made the punjab congress chief despite objections by amarinder singh, who also openly made it known he would oppose any attempt by the party leadership to consider mr sidhu for the top post."

""since the background of the movie has been set out in benaras, up. video of the trailer has received 7300 comments as on september 2021. analysis of the comments reveals that they are appreciative of the trailer and already catalysing the hindu sentiments in a negative manner,"" the petition stated.

""it is probably a strong signal about how concerned china is regarding keeping industry going, and more importantly, the winter that is just around the corner,"" said jeffrey halley, senior market analyst at oanda. nearly 60 percent of the chinese economy is powered by coal, but supply in the world's largest coal importer has been disrupted by the pandemic and squeezed by falling imports amid a trade tiff with australia. as demand for power from factories in china soared utilities were unable to buy enough fuel after prices surged. the country's environmental agenda is further adding to the crisis, with pressure to dampen down coal burning and cap the growth of coal mining after president xi jinping pledged his country would become carbon neutral by 2060. data released on thursday showed china's factory activity contracted last month for the first time since february 2020, when the country was essentially closed by lockdowns as authorities battled the first covid outbreak. han's statement raised concerns that already-high modi prices could surge further. the order ""to me implies that we are in no way on the verge of a cool-off. rather it looks like it is going to get even more crazy"", bjarne schieldrop, an analyst at seb said. ""they will bid whatever it takes to win a bidding war for a cargo of coal"" or liquefied natural gas. the power crunch prompted banks nomura and goldman sachs to cut their growth forecasts for china this year, expecting more disruptions to production. factories that supply multinationals such as apple and carmaker tesla are among those told to temporarily halt production. ""if chinese steel and aluminium smelters are going to be shutting down for extended periods, you can be sure that will reverberate through global supply chains,"" added halley. one factory worker in the industrial hub of dongguan told afp this week they were working overnight after being forced to cease daytime production. ""of course we're unhappy... but we're going along with the hours that the power curbs take place,"" he said.   chinese coal futures on thursday surged to a record as the country grapples with shortages of the fuel ahead of a national holiday, with many factories shut for the week-long break.

""we're in a very dangerous situation where the virus is spreading surrounding the seoul metropolitan area,"" said lee ki-il, deputy minister of health care policy, speaking during a briefing. the upcoming two weeks is an important period as the government is revamping its anti-virus policy to facilitate a phased return to normal activities starting november, he added. among new incentives introduced to encourage people to get vaccinated, the deputy minister said wedding ceremonies can be held with up to 199 attendees if they included 150 fully vaccinated people. ""if the vaccination rate constantly rises and the scales of outbreaks are stably controlled for the next two weeks, we should be able to set out on phased back to normal in earnest,"" lee said. around 77% of south korea's 52 million population had received one shot of vaccine as of thursday, with about 50% fully vaccinated, as the country has quickly ramped up its inoculation campaign despite a shaky start.   the government aims to vaccinate 80% of all adults by the end of october, and is considering introducing a 'vaccine pass' to allow those who have been fully inoculated to use public facilities and travel more freely.

""i am happy,"" said tran van vu, who owns a store selling fruit, vegetables and meat and had planned to expand his business before the pandemic. ""during the lockdown our company was affected a lot... we didn't have enough delivery men as they had to be tested every two days and it was costly for the company."" roads were busy for the first time in months after most businesses were given the go-ahead to reopen and vaccinated people permitted to move freely within the city. although authorities have kept a ban on travel to other provinces, thousands of families travelling by motorbike gathered at a checkpoint on the way out of the city, hoping to return to their hometowns. vietnam was once hailed as a model for virus containment, but the country struggled to stop the spread of a fourth wave of infection that began in april in northern industrial parks and quickly travelled south. more than a third of vietnam's 100 million people were under stay-at-home orders this summer, bringing the country's important manufacturing industry to its knees and breaking supply chains. its economy suffered its heaviest contraction on record in the third quarter, officials said wednesday. factories in industrial parks and goods transportation services are among businesses allowed to open, authorities have said.   less than 10 percent of vietnamese are fully vaccinated but ho chi minh city had been allocated the biggest number of jabs with almost all the city's adults inoculated.

""i think, to some degree, we would all be justified in having levels of concern and to some degree, i think the jury's still out. when i say levels of concern, you know, there were commitments which were made by the taliban, at doha, i mean, the us knows that best i mean, we were not taken into confidence on various aspects of that,"" he said.

""most important are we going to see an afghanistan whose soil is not used for terrorism against other states and the rest of the world, i think, these are our concerns,"" mr jaishankar added. he said what had happened in afghanistan, is going to ""have very, very significant consequences for all of us, and we are so close to the region."" the minister said that the key concerns were captured by a un security council resolution in august and that how those questions are addressed today is still an open question, which is why ""i said the jury is still out"". ""if you ask me is this the time to draw sharp conclusions, i would sort of take my time and study this with a certain degree of deliberation, because as i said, a lot of this, whatever understandings, there have been, many of these are not known to the entire international community,"" he added. to another question on how india and the us looked at the situation in afghanistan, mr jaishankar said both sides are on a similar page, at a principle level on many of the issues, particularly on the possible usage of afghan soil for terrorism. he said the issue figured in discussions between modi modi and us president joe biden in washington last week.

""and, in many ways, china being today is such a big player and so salient in the international economy, i think it's natural that these relationships are quite unique. so what are my problems, or my opportunities would not be the same as that for the us, or australia, or japan, or indonesia or france,"" he added. mr jaishankar said it would be different for each country and added that the rise of china has had a very fundamental impact on the international order. ""so as participants in the international order, we need to assess that and respond to that, in the light of our own interest. so i think it's sort of essential to look normalise this conversation,"" he said.   ""you know, this should not end up as though it's some kind of ganging up and a negatively driven event, i don't think that's the fair description of what is a completely natural evolution of the international order to my mind,"" he added.

""the 8 arms or channels of the ashtamudi lake are what gave it its name. it is the entrance to the famous backwaters of kerala and the houseboat rides here are extremely famous. the kollam to alappuzha route is considered among the best in the backwaters. cruises here give you a deeper look at the heart and spirit of the backwaters,"" the tourism site claims. however, the ground reality is something else according to local resident km salim, who told pti that no one would want to walk alongside the ""highly polluted"" lake let alone go for a ""cruise"" on it when it is reeking with the smell of decades worth of municipal solid waste and sewage. incidentally, based on his letter sent to the kerala high court, it decided to examine the issue, initiating a public interest litigation on its own and asking kelsa to inspect the water body that is the second largest lake in the state. mr salim further said that tourism too has contributed to the lake's pollution as effluents from the house boats are also discharged into the water body. district judge and kelsa member secretary kt nisar ahammad, who inspected the lake, told pti that the filth and garbage floating in the lake and choking its ecosystem -- which includes thousands of years old mangrove trees -- also consists of ""legacy waste"" dumped there over the past several years. on being asked whether the filth in the lake was being termed as such due to it being the legacy we are leaving for future generations, he laughed and said, ""maybe"". the judge further said that people do not realise that polluting the water body could very well affect the underground water in the area and eventually general public health in the long run. ""this situation is not just confined to ashtamudi lake, it is prevalent in many other places in the state. people don't realise that the quarrying of mountains and dumping of filth in rivers and lakes would have serious environmental consequences. there has to be awareness on this issue,"" he said. the judge further said that with a little bit of effort the corporation could have cleaned up some portion of the lake, especially the part close to the kerala state road transport corporation (ksrtc) bus stand where the situation is really bad, but no one, including the local body, appeared to be bothered. he said that a few years back the government had sanctioned funds for cleaning up the lake, but it never took off and now there was another project, worth over â‚¹ 100 crore, in play for the same purpose. mr salim said that the garbage and filth were being dumped in the area for years and as a result, more than 100 species of fishes, mangroves, coconut groves and palm trees that are part of that ecosystem were being adversely affected. a resident of the area for decades, he remembers his younger days when, along with his friends, he used to take a dip in the lake. ""now you cannot even dare to dip your hand in the water as, if you do, you could end up having rashes or blisters or some other infection,"" he said. even fish like karimeen found in the lake no longer taste the same as they used to during his younger days when ashtamudi was not as polluted as it was presently, he said. ""you cannot walk along the lake side without your olfactory senses being overwhelmed by the stink emanating from there,"" he added. photographs attached along with the kelsa report, filed through advocate santhosh mathew, show all kinds of garbage and waste floating in the lake, along with the house boats, turning its colour to a murky green. in some photographs, which according to the judge ""speak volumes"", the water body looks more like an open drain and less like a lake whose borders are also lined in many places with garbage. what is more anguishing regarding ashtamudi, other than the inaction of the local bodies and their contribution in polluting the lake, is the fact that despite being a ramsar site -- a wetland site designed to be of international importance under ramsar convention which is also known as the ''convention of wetlands'' -- nothing was being done by anyone to remedy the situation, both the judge and mr salim said. the convention, an intergovernmental environmental treaty adopted in 1971 by unesco and which came into force in 1975, provides for national action and international cooperation regarding the conservation of wetlands and wise sustainable use of their resources, according to the kelsa report. the report by kelsa further states that inspection of the lake revealed that the main reason behind its pollution was the direct dumping of sewage into it from the nearby government institutions, residences and a public toilet, very near to the water body, meant for passengers arriving at the ksrtc bus stand close by.   it also said that while the secretary of the district panchayat denied dumping of sewage waste in the water body from a nearby district hospital, ""the fact remains that the lake is highly polluted and its present condition is very pathetic."" pollution of water bodies, like ashtamudi lake, in this manner was a ""common scenario"" in the whole of kerala, the report stated."

""this is a real concern for policy makers,"" neil ferguson, the imperial college epidemiologist whose models are used by the uk government, said at a conference in paris. ""it's highly likely we will continue to see circulation of reasonably high levels of covid through the winter, and having seasonal flu on top could pose again significant additional burdens on health systems."" ferguson and others at the meeting said vaccination in rich countries means there probably won't be a surge in deaths from the covid but that waning protection from those shots and other factors could still mean plenty of people end up in the hospital. meanwhile, flu immunity may also have diminished among the general population after two winters with few cases, according to arnaud fontanet, an epidemiologist who advises the french government. concern about withering covid protection prompted israel -- one of the first countries to start vaccinating early in the year -- to begin administering booster shots months ago. ""it was pretty striking for us to see early on that a majority of our severe cases were among fully vaccinated individuals,"" said ran balicer of israel's clalit research institute. britain began offering boosters to people age 50 and over and other vulnerable groups last month. giving flu shots at the same appointment would make it easier for both patients and the health service, said rajeka lazarus, a consultant in infectious diseases and microbiology and chief investigator for the uk report released on thursday. the study -- involving researchers at the university of bristol, and university hospitals bristol and weston nhs foundation trust -- showed that side effects from getting the vaccines at the same time were mild to moderate, with no negative impact on the immune response to either shot. it involved 679 adult volunteers at national health service sites in england and wales who were due for their second dose of either the pfizer inc.-biontech se or astrazeneca inc. vaccines. they were divided at random into two groups to blindly receive different combinations of shots or a placebo in opposite arms over two visits between april and june. the results haven't yet been peer-reviewed. results from the british study provide a strong indication that people can safely receive their booster doses with a flu shot, according to lazarus. ferguson presented data at the paris conference showing that the shot from astrazeneca and its partner, the university of oxford, protected less than pfizer-biontech's against the delta variant. like israel, he said the uk had seen ""clear evidence of waning protection"" from both shots against mild disease as well as more severe outcomes. after two doses, the astra shot offers 52% protection against mild symptomatic disease caused by delta, compared with 90% for the pfizer one, according to ferguson's data.   delta may have turned sars-cov-2 into ""one of the most transmissible respiratory viruses we have ever seen,"" with a reproduction rate between 6 and 9, he said.

""whether it is a minister, officer, or chief minister, there are limitations and without the permission of the government of india one cannot go outside the country. no one can cross these limitations. what action can be taken will have to be discussed with the centre. maharashtra government is looking for him and once he is found we will decide,"" the home minister added. on february 25 this year, an suv with gelatin sticks was found at carmichael road, near the residence of mukesh ambani. the car belonged to mansukh hiren whose body was later found in the kalwa creek in thane. a police officer, sachin waze, was named as the prime conspirator in the case of planting the explosives and the subsequent murder of mansukh hiren. mr waze was known to be close to param bir singh and had direct access to him despite being just an assistant police inspector. mr singh was transferred from the post of mumbai police commissioner in march after mr waze's arrest by the national investigation agency (nia). the nia chargesheet in the case has not named param bir singh as an accused but several revelations in the chargesheet could make things difficult for param bir singh. after his transfer to the home guard department, the ips officer made sensational accusations against then state home minister anil deshmukh of asking police officers to collect bribes from hotel and bar owners, an allegation the latter denied.   but mr deshmukh stepped down from his post subsequently as the cbi registered a case against him. mr deshmukh has also not responded to summons by the enforcement directorate which is probing money-laundering allegations against him. the ed has asked for help from the cbi to trace mr deshmukh. mr singh has also been named in at least four extortion complaints and maharashtra police chief sanjay pandey recently sent a proposal to suspend mr singh and other police officials named in the extortion cases, but the state home department has sought more details, news agency pti reported."

""it's time to give australians their lives back. we've saved lives,"" morrison said during a televised media conference. ""we've saved livelihoods, but we must work together to ensure that australians can reclaim the lives that they once had in this country."" morrison slammed the international border shut in march 2020. since then, only a limited number of people have been granted a permit to leave the country for critical business or humanitarian reasons. citizens and permanent residents have been allowed to return from abroad, subject to quota limits and a mandatory 14-day quarantine period in a hotel at their own expense. there have also been a few high-profile exceptions granted for entry for business purposes, including hollywood actors to film movies and tv shows. morrison said he expects the first home quarantine systems to be up and running in november, but the timetable will be set by individual states and territories. he has previously said it wants all state and international borders reopened when the national vaccination rate for people aged over 16 reaches 80%, expected by the end of next month. however, a delta variant-fuelled outbreak that has locked down the major cities of sydney, melbourne and canberra for weeks has divided state and territory leaders. some presiding over virus-free parts of the country have indicated they will defy the federal plan. under the plan announced on friday, australians who are fully vaccinated will be able to travel abroad and complete a 7-day quarantine at home on their return. people who are not vaccinated will be required to undertake 14 days of quarantine at a hotel when they return. morrison said his government was working towards quarantine free travel with countries such as new zealand when ""safe to do so"". an australian government source said plans were being discussed to allow foreign visitors to enter the country, but it was not possible to yet state a timetable. vaccine approval australia's strict border closure has been credited with keeping both fatalities and infections relatively low. it has recorded just over 107,000 covid cases and about 1,300 deaths since the start of the pandemic. the country on friday reported 2,084 new covid cases, the bulk of which were detected in new south wales and victoria states. the results marked a small decline in case numbers from those reported one day earlier, but authorities warned against complacency. australia will also expand its list of authorised covid vaccines, allowing thousands of citizens and permanent residents still abroad to return via the home quarantine system, morrison said.   australia currently only recognises vaccines produced by pfizer, moderna and astrazeneca. the source said china's sinovac and covishield, a version of astrazeneca's vaccine produced by the serum institute of india, would be added to the list.

""my priority is to resolve the pandemic so we can drive the economy to recovery,"" said pacquiao, who was wearing a maroon polo shirt and a white face mask with his and the philippine flag's image. on his way to the registration building, pacquiao was greeted by dozens of supporters waiting by the roadside and waving banners that read ""fight, pacman."" pacquiao said he was unperturbed by the results of an opinion poll showing him in fourth spot among preferred presidential contenders, saying: ""the voices of the poor have not been heard."" one of the greatest boxers of all time and the only man to hold world titles in eight different divisions, pacquiao retired from boxing in september to run for the presidency. he is a two-term congress and currently senator. the registration process should put an end to months of speculation over who will vie to succeed firebrand president rodrigo duterte, 76, who under the constitution cannot seek re-election and will contest the vice presidency race instead. aside from pacquiao, two other contenders have declared their intention to run for president. manila mayor francisco ""isko moreno"" domagosoa former actor, and senator panfilo lacson, an ex police chief, were expected to file their certificates in the following days. but the spotlight will be on sara duterte-carpio, the president's daughter, despite her ruling out running for the office next year. duterte-carpio, 43, replaced her father as davao city mayor when he became president, and she remains by far the most popular presidential prospect, according to successive opinion polls this year. analysts say it is crucial her father's successor is a loyalist, to insulate him from potential legal action at home or by the international criminal court, over the thousands of state killings in his war on drugs since 2016. critics say his interest in the vice presidency is also a self-preservation move. duterte says his motivation is public service, not power. vice president, leni robredo, who leads the opposition, is also being urged by supporters to run for the top post. ""in the coming days, please pray with me so that our decision will be what is best for our country,"" she said. more than 60 million filipinos will vote in may 2022 for a new president, vice president, and more than 18,000 lawmakers and local government officials.   candidates have until oct. 8 to register, but withdrawals and substitutions are allowed until nov. 15, leaving scope for last-minute changes of heart, like the 11th hour entry of duterte for the 2016 election, which he won by a huge margin.

""i started kalari when i was seven years old. i am 78 now. i am still practising, learning and teaching,"" the matriarch of the kadathanad kalari sangham school, founded by her late husband in 1949, told afp. ""when you open the newspapers, you only see news of violence against women,"" she said. ""when women learn this martial art, they feel physically and mentally strong and it makes them confident to work and travel alone."" kalari, which contains elements of dance and yoga, can involve weapons such as swords, shields and staffs. reputedly 3,000 years old, and mentioned in ancient hindu scriptures, it remains infused with religion in the present day. india's british colonial rulers banned the practice in 1804 but it survived underground before a revival in the early 20th century and after independence in 1947. in recent decades it has come on in leaps and bounds, thanks in no small measure to meenakshi, who won a national award in 2017. now it is recognised as a sport and practised all over india. inside meenakshi's kalari hall, her bare-chested son sanjeev kumar, a lungi tied around his waist, puts barefoot pupils -- boys and girls alike -- through their paces on the ochre-red earth floor. ""there are two divisions in kalaripayattu -- one is that kalaripayattu is peace and the other is kalaripayattu in war,"" said the ""gurukkal"" (master). ""it's an art that purifies mind, body and soul, improves concentration, speed and patience, regenerates physical and mental energy.

""with the weather we are going to have from tomorrow,"" marked by a possible change in the direction of winds that have so far dispersed the gases towards the sea, it is possible ""the smell of sulphur"" will be felt ""with greater intensity"", pevolca official ruben fernandez said. sulphur dioxide levels increased for the first time on thursday afternoon in tazacorte, while the ash particles increased in density in santa cruz de la palma, according to the national institute of toxicology. since it began on september 19, the dramatic eruption has forced thousands out of their homes, while lava has destroyed hundreds of houses, businesses and huge swathes of banana plantations. the volcano spewed out rivers of lava that slowly crept towards the sea, eventually pouring into the atlantic ocean late on tuesday. since then, the rivers of molten rock have not stopped cascading into the sea, creating a growing lava delta. while the initial impact on the flora and fauna of being submerged under the river of molten rock is devastating, over the longer term, it may prove beneficial -- bringing minerals from the earth's core to the surface and providing a habitat both underwater and on land for colonisation by species, experts said. fernando tuya, a biodiversity researcher at the university of la palma, said: ""the lava will form a rocky platform that will become a substrate for numerous marine species in the future, that is to say in three to five years."" as the white-hot lava poured into the sea, it sent plumes of acid fumes into the air that experts said could irritate the skin, eyes and respiratory tracts. but fears it could affect the local population were quickly allayed as strong winds dispersed the vapours over the sea. however that could change with the wind direction predicted to turn around on friday. disaster zone some 300 residents in the nearby town of tazacorte have been told to stay at home to avoid any chance of inhaling the gases and a 3.5-kilometre (two-mile) exclusion zone remained in place, which also extends two nautical miles out to sea. ""until we know that these areas are not at risk, these measures will be maintained,"" pevolca's ruben fernandez said on wednesday evening. la palma has been declared a natural disaster zone, with the lava scorching its way across 476 hectares of land, the local government said on twitter. it has so far destroyed 855 buildings, an increase of more than 200 in just over 24 hours, the eu's copernicus observation programme said on twitter. the eruption of la cumbre vieja has forced some 6,000 people to flee their homes but so far, nobody has been injured or killed. although the volcano is still erupting, la palma's airport resumed operations on wednesday after flights were suspended at the weekend due to the ash. on thursday, farmers were allowed to access their plantations outside the security zone to collect bananas -- the chief cash crop on the island.   la cumbre vieja lies about 15 kilometres (nine miles) west of the airport as the crow flies, although the lava has only spilt down the western side of the volcano.

""if you're looking at how much political capital is the administration willing to spend on this issue, especially after afghanistan, it's probably not very high,"" she said. north korea said recent tests included a new hypersonic missile, whose speed would be a potential game-changer, and kim called the us offer of talks a ""petty trick."" trump had sought a wide-ranging agreement with north korea, with which the united states remains technically still at war, but his three meetings failed to produce more than promises by kim to hold off on nuclear and long-range missile testing. ""the last thing kim jong un is going to want is another high-profile diplomatic failure at a time when they're having economic hardships and covid hardship,"" town said. small steps? in an april policy review, the biden administration said it was willing to engage north korea and be flexible. the policy appeared to be different both from trump's pageantry and, at least on paper, from obama's concept of ""strategic patience,"" or waiting indefinitely until north korea budges. few north korea watchers believe that kim will accept us demands to give up the nuclear arsenal, seen as an ultimate guarantor of security. but jacob stokes, a fellow at the center for a new american security, said the biden administration could still negotiate an end to provocative behavior such as tests. the challenge ""is can you shelve the long-term question long enough to make interim progress,"" stokes said. if north korea wants to keep up ""aggressive provocations until the united states and south korea provide a bunch of unilateral upfront concessions as the price of even getting to the negotiating table, that's very unlikely to work,"" he said. north korea has nonetheless taken small steps to ease tensions with south korea, including restoring a military hotline. the biden administration has put a priority on allies south korea and japan and backed efforts by the south's dovish president, moon jae-in. secretary of state antony blinken said thursday he supported any south korean efforts that can ""reduce the risks,"" even as the united states prepared to take north korea before the un security council. looking for new ways ken gause, who directs the adversary analytics program at the cna research organization, said north korea appeared to be following a two-track approach of raising the stakes with the united states while hoping south korea can push diplomacy forward. ""north korea has a game plan -- to push the us off strategic patience and to get them to put sanctions relief on the table. that's why they reject unconditional talks,"" gause said. he said that the previous administration -- ""completely for reasons that had to do with trump's mindset"" -- found a more productive way to engage north korea, but ultimately failed by focusing on pressure rather than incentives. he feared that the biden administration, filled with veteran policymakers, will not ""think out of the box.""   ""for the last 40-50 years, we have framed this problem as a bilateral, black-and-white zero-sum game on the korean peninsula -- you win, we lose, we win, you lose. that's where we are now.""
