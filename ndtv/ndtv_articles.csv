The Journal said about two-dozen US service members have trained Taiwanese ground and maritime forces ""for at least a year,"" amid China's rising verbal threats against the island ally of the United States. The report cited unnamed officials for the report. Taiwan's Defense Ministry declined to comment on the report. The Pentagon did not confirm or deny it. Spokesman John Supple said the US support for Taiwan's military is gauged on its defense needs. ""Our support for and defense relationship with Taiwan remains aligned against the current threat posed by the People's Republic of China,"" Supple said in a statement. ""We urge Beijing to honor its commitment to the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait differences."" The report appeared to confirm Taiwan media articles last November -- which cited Taiwan's Naval Command -- that US troops had arrived there to train Taiwan marines and special forces in small-boat and amphibious operations. Those reports were subsequently denied by US and Taiwanese officials, who emphasized the two sides are involved in bilateral military exchanges and cooperation. The United States supplies weapons to Taiwan, including missiles for defense and fighter jets, amid Beijing's threat to forcibly retake control of the island and reintegrate it with China. The US also maintains an ambiguous commitment to defend Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province. A video released last year and featured in Taiwan media showed US troops taking part in an exercise on the island dubbed ""Balance Tamper."" Chinese forces have stepped up their activities toward Taiwan in the past year, conducting sea assault exercises and flying large sorties of bombers and fighters close to Taiwan airspace. On Monday, Taiwan scrambled its own air force after a record 56 Chinese warplanes crossed into its air defense zone. US State Department Spokesman Ned Price called the Chinese activity ""destabilizing"" and ""provocative.""   ""We strongly urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic and economic pressure and coercion against Taiwan,"" he said, calling US commitment to the island ""rock-solid"".

""I'm excited to announce that we're moving our headquarters to Austin, Texas,"" Musk said at an annual shareholders meeting. ""Just to be clear, though, we will be continuing to expand our activities in California."" Musk said Tesla sales are growing strongly, and the company is ramping up deliveries despite shortages of computer chips and other components. Tesla aims to increase production at its plant in Fremont, California, by some 50 percent, Musk said. But that plant is hitting its limits on how much more it can handle, he said. ""When we first went in there it was it like a kid in his parents' shoes; tiny us and this giant factory,"" Musk said of its inaugural plant in Silicon Valley. ""Now, its like a spam can. We are hitting the sides of the bowl."" He noted that the cost of living in Silicon Valley is high for workers, with home prices putting them out of reach for workers, who often wind up with long commutes. Musk has clashed with regulators in California, and is among high-profile tech figures who personally left the state for places with lower income taxes and less regulation. Winning with diversity A stockholder-submitted proposal to have Tesla disclose more about diversity and inclusion efforts at the company won approval, despite opposition from the board of directors, according to preliminary results. It calls for comprehensive breakdowns of Tesla's workforce by race and gender, along with insights into how well efforts to improve diversity are doing, to be routinely disclosed to investors. ""The business case for diversity is clear,"" said Calvert Research and Management vice president Kimberly Stokes, who spoke on behalf of the proposal. ""As shareholders we are concerned that Tesla's lack of focus on equity, diversity and inclusion could hinder the company's ability to innovate in the future."" Calvert's winning proposal was one of four put on the agenda by investors urging Tesla to better protect worker rights and well-being. A California jury this week ordered Tesla to pay a Black former employee $137 million in damages for turning a blind eye to racism the man said he encountered at the firm's Silicon Valley auto plant. ""They awarded an amount that could be a wake-up call for American corporations,"" said civil rights attorney Larry Organ, who represented the former Tesla worker. ""Don't engage in racist conduct and don't allow racist conduct to continue."" Owen Diaz was hired through a staffing agency as an elevator operator at the electric vehicle-maker's Fremont factory between June 2015 and July 2016, where he was subjected to racist abuse and a hostile work environment, according to the court filing. Instead of a modern workplace, the plaintiff ""encountered a scene straight from the Jim Crow era,"" said the suit. The jury at the federal court in San Francisco on Monday awarded Diaz $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress, Organ confirmed. In a post, human resources vice president Valerie Capers Workman downplayed the allegations of racist abuse in the lawsuit but acknowledged that at the time Diaz worked there, Tesla ""was not perfect.""   Workman stressed that Tesla had made changes since Diaz worked at the company, adding a diversity team and an employee relations team dedicated to investigating employee complaints.

Planning for the cash airlifts is going ahead against the background of a rapidly collapsing economy where money is short, although diplomats are still debating whether Western powers can demand that the Taliban make concessions in return, according to internal policy documents seen by Reuters. The emergency funding, aimed at averting a humanitarian crisis in the face of drought and political upheaval, could see U.S. dollar bills flown into Kabul for distribution via banks in payments of less than $200 directly to the poor - with the Taliban's blessing but without their involvement. As well as flying in cash to stem the immediate crisis, donor countries want to set up a ""humanitarian-plus"" trust fund that would pay salaries and keep schools and hospitals open, two senior officials said. Many Afghans have started selling their possessions to pay for ever scarcer food. The departure of U.S.-led forces and many international donors robbed the country of grants that financed 75% of public spending, according to the World Bank. The West's unorthodox strategy reflects the dilemma it faces. Still eager to help Afghanistan after two decades of war, and to prevent mass migration, it is also loathe to give money to the Taliban, who seized power in August and have yet to show significant change from the harsh way they ruled the country between 1996-2001. CASH DROPS The United Nations has warned that 14 million Afghans face hunger. Mary-Ellen McGroarty, U.N. World Food Programme Afghanistan director, said the economy could collapse in the face of the cash crisis. ""Many parents are foregoing food so that their children can eat,"" she has said. In recent days, Western diplomats and officials have stepped up efforts to establish a cash lifeline. The United Nations World Food Programme has distributed about 10 million Afghanis ($110,000) in cash via a local bank and intends to disburse more soon, said one person with knowledge of the situation. The cash runs are a trial for larger air deliveries of dollars from Pakistan, the person said. A senior diplomat said two approaches are under consideration that would inject cash into the Afghan economy. Both are in the planning stages. Under the first plan, the World Food Programme would fly in cash and distribute it directly to people to buy food, expanding on something the agency already has been doing on a smaller scale. The second approach would see cash flown in to be held by banks on behalf of the United Nations. That would be used to pay salaries to the staff of U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations, the diplomat said. A third person said U.N. officials had talked with Afghan banks about opening up cash distribution channels. ""If the country collapses, we will all pay the consequences,"" said a senior European Union official. ""No one wants to rush into a recognition of the Taliban, but we need to deal with them. The question is not if ... but how."" A spokesperson for the World Food Programme said it had helped almost 4 million people in September, nearly triple the August number, chiefly with food, and some cash assistance had been given out in Kabul. The spokesperson said the cash shortage was also affecting the millers and truckers it worked with. He said that the agency was not flying cash into Afghanistan. NINE-BILLION-DOLLAR LEVERAGE Separately, the European Union, Britain and the United States have discussed setting up an international trust fund to bypass the Afghan government and help finance local services, according to two officials with knowledge of the matter. The Taliban did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the cash airlift plans. A U.S. Treasury spokesperson said it would allow humanitarian assistance through independent international and non-governmental organisations while ""denying assets"" to the Taliban and sanctioning its leaders. The Kabul government has little to fall back on. The central bank, with assets of $9 billion frozen offshore, has burnt through much of its reserves at home. Shah Mehrabi, an official who helped oversee the bank before the Taliban took over and is still in his post, recently appealed for a release of the overseas reserves. ""If reserves remain frozen, Afghan importers will not be able to pay for their shipments, banks will start to collapse, food will be become scarce,"" he said. But there is also a debate about whether strings should be attached to cash releases. In a paper written last month and seen by Reuters, French and German officials outline their aim of using money as a ""lever"" to pressure the Taliban. ""Countries could condition recognition of the political ... legitimacy of the Taliban to the commitments they would be ready to take,"" officials said in the two-page report. ""Economic and trade levers are among the strongest we have,"" the note said, raising the prospect of releasing the Afghan reserves held abroad. In a separate diplomatic note, French and German officials outline five demands that could be made of the Taliban.   Those include allowing Afghans who want to leave the country to do so, ""breaking ties with ... terrorist organisations"", allowing access to humanitarian aid, respect for human rights and establishing an ""inclusive government"".

WHO authorisation has been sought for the Sputnik V jab created by Russia's Gamaleya research institute, which is already being used in 45 countries, according to an AFP count. Several Covid-19 vaccines have been given the WHO green light for emergency use during the pandemic: Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm, Sinovac and AstraZeneca in various plants. For Sputnik V, ""the process was put on hold due to the lack of some legal procedures"", said Mariangela Simao, the WHO assistant director-general for access to medicines, vaccines and pharmaceuticals. ""In negotiations with the Russian government, this problem is about to be sorted out,"" she told a press conference. ""As soon as the legal procedures are finished, we are able to restart the process."" WHO emergency use listing is the green light that gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that a vaccine has met international standards. The listing paves the way for countries to approve and import a vaccine for distribution quickly, especially those states without an international-class regulator of their own. Dossier incomplete Sputnik V is already being used in countries including Algeria, Argentina, India, Iran, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Russia itself. ""There are still the issues around complete information on the dossier that has to be provided by the applicant,"" said Simao. ""Then there is also the issues regarding the final finalisation of the inspections in the different manufacturers in Russia, but I'm happy to say that the about the process is about to be restarted."" In June, the WHO said it conducted nine inspections of Sputnik V manufacturing sites and uncovered various problems at the Pharmstandard Ufa Vitamin Plant in Ufa, southern Russia. Moscow insisted the problems had since been resolved. Russia is among the countries hardest-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with the fifth-highest number of recorded deaths according to an AFP tally on Thursday: 213,549 fatalities from 7,690,110 cases.   Several Russian vaccines including Sputnik V have been available for months, but authorities have struggled to immunise a vaccine-sceptic population.

Politico and The Washington Post both reported that ex-advisors Mark Meadows, Kash Patel, Dan Scavino and Steve Bannon were told not to cooperate with the formal House investigation into the riot by Trump supporters, which critics have labelled an outright insurrection. The reports came hours after the release of a damning Senate report detailing Trump's efforts to subvert the Justice Department and overturn his November election loss to Joe Biden. Trump's lawyers argued in a letter to the four that his communications and records are protected from disclosure by executive privilege and attorney-client privilege. The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack has called the four ex-advisers, and other people involved in the unrest, to help it piece together the ties between Trump's White House and the hundreds of Trump backers who forced their way into the Congress, halting a joint session meant to confirm Biden as president. At the time Meadows was White House chief of staff; Scavino handled social media for Trump; Bannon was a former political strategist who remained active in Republican operations; and Patel was a White House national security advisor whom Trump named to a senior Pentagon job following his election loss. The four were ordered by the January 6 committee to hand over documents and appear for interviews with investigators next week. Legal experts have raised doubts that Trump can claim executive privilege over his actions in his final weeks in office to prevent his aides from talking. But the issue has not been tested much in courts and the White House has said it would waive privilege on Trump's records to an extent in order to help with the probe. And Trump's defiance could force the committee into legal fights that could stretch out the investigation. ""The former president is still trying to stonewall subpoenas,"" said committee member Adam Schiff in a tweeted statement. ""This time, lawbreaking witnesses must weigh the prospect of criminal prosecution,"" he warned.   ""Americans deserve answers. We will make sure they get them.""

""The preparation and plans are being completed and soon the universities related to the Islamic Emirate will also be opened and the education will continue,"" Haqqani said. Back in August, all the universities were closed after the Taliban's siege of Afghanistan but private universities have since reopened, reported Tolo News.

But the Taliban is still being slammed by Afghan students for delaying the process of reopening the universities. ""We have seen this many times: They say they are working on a plan, but it has been over a month and the plan has not finalized,"" said Omid Mawllavi Zada, a political science student at Kabul University.

The Narcotics Control Bureau or NCB conducted the raid on Sunday and arrested eight people, including actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan. The NCB said drugs like ecstasy and cocaine, among others, were found at a party on the cruise ship. Days later, videos of the raid surfaced online showing the two men escorting those who were detained that night into the NCB office. On Tuesday, Nationalist Congress Party spokesperson Nawab Malik told reporters that Manu Bhanushali, who was seen escorting one of the accused Arbaaz Merchant into the NCB's office, is a BJP worker. Mr Malik also pointed out Mr Bhanushali's photo with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah from his social media profiles. Mr Bhanushali told NDTV that he got information from a friend outside Maharashtra that a party where drugs would be used would be held on October 1. ""I am a BJP worker for the last 10-15 years, just one among the 11 crore workers. Just because I am a BJP worker, I am being targeted. Nawab Malik's son-in-law was caught in a drugs case, that's why he is targeting me. I only intend to save the youth of this country from the drugs menace,"" Mr Bhanushali told NDTV. On whether he knew if Aryan Khan was going to be at the party, Mr Bhanushali said, ""I did not know Aryan Khan was going to be at the party. I have WhatsApp chats to prove that on my phone if an investigation takes place."" The high-profile drug raid that led to the arrest of Aryan Khan, 23, has yielded 13 grams of cocaine, 21 grams of charas, 22 pills of MDMA and 5 grams of MD, the NCB had said. The BJP worker who often visits Delhi said none from the party has contacted him yet, but he will speak to the ""authorities"". ""I will go to the authorities asking for security. The BJP has got nothing to do with the arrests. In Maharashtra, my life is under threat. I have come to Delhi for my personal security,"" Mr Bhanushali said.   Earlier, NCP's Nawab Malik had alleged that ""not even a single gram of drug was seized on the cruise or at the terminal."" ""Aryan Khan's arrest is a forgery. For the last one month, information was being circulated to crime reporters that the next target is actor Shah Rukh Khan,"" said Mr Malik."

She finds an eighty-year-old tribal woman waiting to get her second dose of the Covid vaccine. Dr R Sandhya was part of the team that achieved the feat of administering the COVID-19 vaccine to 100% of the tribal population in Tamil Nadu's Nilgiri district. The Tamil Nadu government announced that double vaccination had been completed for all those eligible in the community of over 21,000. Many of them live in difficult terrain in remote forest areas. NDTV accompanied two health teams on their vaccination drives and observed the challenges they faced. Dr Sandhya's team had to walk for nearly two hours to just inoculate four tribals. ""Even if one person is left out, there is a risk of around 500 people here contracting the virus,"" says Dr Sandhya. ""Many from these communities don't come to our vaccination centres. So it's important we reach out,"" she adds. The Nilgiris district has a population of 7.2 lakh, of which 21,000 are tribals from six tribes that are listed in India's particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTG). Over the last few months, doctors and health workers have visited nearly 1,300 tribal settlements to achieve the 100% vaccination target. Terrain and distance weren't the only odds that the health teams battled. While passing through wetlands, the village's head nurse, R Malarkodi, was sucked on by a leech. Brushing off the pain, she says, ""As a health worker I am proud of this mission to keep people safe amid the pandemic."" Another major challenge was vaccine hesitancy among the tribals. The district administration managed to persuade a few tribals to get the shot, who then went on to become ambassadors and convinced everybody in their communities to get inoculated.   Nilgiris collector, J Innocent Divya, says that they had to make several visits to the same set of villages to convince locals to get the vaccine. ""The NGOs helped us very much. We even made a vaccine jingle in tribal languages,"" Divya told NDTV. The district, which is known for its tea plantation, was badly hit during the second wave of the pandemic. This forced the administration to ramp up vaccinations ahead of a possible third wave of Covid."

The incident comes at a time when Kashmir is on high alert in the wake of civilian killings by terrorists. Over the past six days, seven people have been gunned down by terrorists. The man killed in the incident was reportedly a resident of Jammu and was travelling back. ""The vehicle rushed towards the naka party. It was then challenged by the troops on duty. Troops fired in self-defence and one person died,"" said Vijay Kumar, Inspector General of Police, Jammu and Kashmir. Mr Kumar said the driver of the SUV managed to escape and the identity of the man killed in the firing is being verified. Several political leaders have condemned the killing and demanded action against the security personnel involved. PDP chief and former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has termed it the ""start of a knee jerk reaction"" and said the civilian's death was the result of ""disproportionate force"" used by CRPF. ""This appears to be the start of a knee jerk reaction to what has transpired during last two days. Disproportionate force has been used by CRPF which has resulted in this innocent civilian's death. Will there be any action against the trigger happy personnel?"" she tweeted. Earlier today, the principal and a teacher of a government school were shot dead in Srinagar. The terrorists entered the Government Boys Higher Secondary School in Srinagar's Eidgah area and shot Deepak Chand, a teacher and Supunder Kour, the principal, from a close range. On Tuesday, 70-year-old Makhan Lal Bindroo, a prominent businessman and the owner of a pharmacy in Srinagar's Iqbal Park, was shot dead inside his store.

Talking to reporters at Baramati, his home turf, he also said the inquiry of persons who were not related to the financial transactions under the lens was ""excessive use of power"", and urged people to decide till when they would accept it. The I-T raids in the state are a reaction from the central government, he said. ""I have strongly condemned the UP (Lakhimpur Kheri) incident, where farmers were killed. I even compared it to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Also, the state government has condemned it in its cabinet meeting... It cannot be ruled out that the I-T department's action against various firms in the state is a reaction to our strong condemnation of the UP incident,"" Mr Pawar said. The I-T department today raided some businesses linked to family members of Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and some real estate developers on charges of alleged tax evasion.

When asked about the I-T raids on the residences of Ajit Pawar's sisters, the former Union minister called it ""excessive use of power"". ""The I-T department has the right to exercise its power to inquire people who are related and responsible for the firms and their financial transactions. But the inquiry of persons who are not related to the financial transactions is excessive use of power and people should decide till when they are going to accept such blatant use of power,"" he said. Talking about the seizure of drugs from a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast last week, Mr Pawar said he saw some people who did not belong to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) talking away the accused in the case. He called it a political party's interference in the central agency's work. His party had earlier questioned the presence of two persons along with the NCB team during the raid, and alleged that one of them was a BJP member. ""It was claimed that those party workers were there as witnesses. It is okay to have witnesses during the raid or in the court, but their role in taking the accused to the NCB office highlights that party people are involved in the agency work,"" Mr Pawar alleged. When asked if the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners contesting the recently-held local elections together benefited them, Mr Pawar said it was found to be fruitful to some extent, but it would be like jumping to a conclusion in haste.

The school principal Supinder Kaur was also killed. With this, seven civilians have been killed by terrorists in Kashmir in five days. Several people gathered at Chand's residence as his parents and family members struggled to come to terms with their loss. Their grief quickly turned into anger. ""The government says Kashmiri Hindus can return to the valley. Deepak had gone back to his homeland as a teacher. In return, he got this reward,"" Chand's cousin Ashwani Kumar said. ""They (terrorists) have killed my brother. He has a 3-year-old daughter. The government should give us justice,"" said Chand's brother, Vijay. He demanded that the government provide security to all Hindus working in the Valley before it is too late. The family members said that the spate of civilian killings - the worst since Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 was revoked in August 2019 - reminded them of the 1990s when minorities, especially Kashmiri Pandits, were targeted by terrorists, triggering their exodus from the valley. Chand, a Hindu, and Kaur, a Srinagar-based Sikh, were killed two days after The Resistance Force, a shadow outfit of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the deaths of three people on Tuesday.

Children have been infected in greater numbers in the latest coronavirus wave driven by the Delta variant, and inoculating young people is seen as key to keeping schools open and helping end the pandemic. In late September, Pfizer and BioNTech, the German biotechnology giant which co-developed the vaccine, began submitting data to Food and Drug Administration regulators for the highly anticipated authorization. Pfizer tweeted early Thursday that the two companies had ""officially submitted our request"" to the FDA ""for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of our #COVID19 vaccine in children 5 to <12."" ""We're committed to working with the FDA with the ultimate goal of helping protect children against this serious public health threat,"" Pfizer said. The FDA said last week it had scheduled a meeting of an advisory committee to review the data on October 26, before giving its opinion on whether authorization should be granted. The agency has previously said that once the formal submission was completed, it would complete its review ""likely in a matter of weeks rather than months."" The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would subsequently publish recommendations for use for healthcare providers administering the shots.   ""If there is approval or authorization, and a CDC recommendation, we are ready, we have the supply,"" White House Covid coordinator Jeff Zients told CNN following the announcement. ""I think we can all agree that getting a safe and effective vaccine for kids five to 11 is a really important next step in our fight against the virus."""

Built in 1907 in Ashdown Forest in southern England but later replaced and restored, the bridge fetched 131,625 Pounds ($179,167, 154,830 euros) in a sealed bid, auctioneer Summers Place Auctions said. Originally known as Posingford Bridge, it captured the imaginations of generations of children as ""Poohsticks Bridge"" where the bear protagonist invented a game dropping sticks and pinecones into the water below. Milne's son Christopher Robin, who inspired the books and shared his name with the boy who joined Pooh in his adventures, played on the bridge in the 1920s before it appeared in the books, illustrated by EH Shepard.     Though the lot attracted global bids, the bridge was ultimately claimed by local aristocrat William Sackville, whose Buckhurst Park estate is located just a short distance from where the bridge was built. Sackville, whose lands encompass the area recreated in the Pooh books as the ""Hundred Acre Wood"" said he was ""delighted"" with the purchase.   ""It will take pride of place on the estate close to its original position and I hope that many children (and adults) will be able to admire the original bridge which inspired one of the most famous games still played by children in the UK and abroad -- 'Poohsticks',"" he said.

Experts of the more popular treatment option, allopathy, do not consider homeopathy as a science. Mr Sonowal, who was addressing a programme at the National Institute of Homeopathy in the city, asked the students to prove that alternate medicine is the best way of treating diseases. ""I ask all the students to work hard to show the strength of homeopathy and AYUSH in the 22nd century. We have to prove that these too are science,"" he said. ""To take homeopathy forward we will have to work very hard and prove to the people this is the best method of treatment,"" he added. The central minister urged the students of homeopathy to work in a way such that, in any place in the world they may be, people begin to respect homeopathy. Mr Sonowal had tabled the National Commission for Homoeopathy (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in the Lok Sabha this August. It proposed to amend the National Commission for Homoeopathy Act, 2020 to provide a medical education system that improves access to quality and affordable medical education. Mr Sonowal, who was accompanied by Minister of State Mahendra Munjapara at the programme, inaugurated a hostel for girl students of the institute and announced an increment in the stipends of the residents.

The development is being seen as further sidelining of the elder siblings in the party founded and headed by the father who has made little secret of his preference for younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. The list, signed by the party's principal national secretary general Abdul Bari Siddiqui, comprises 20 names, including Lalu Prasad Yadav himself who is now out of jail and, if his health permits, can canvass for his party's candidates for Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan. Another notable omission is that of Mr Yadav's wife and former Chief Minister Rabri Devi, a demure housewife-turned-politician who has of late seemed more content playing the role of a matriarch in the family that often betrays hints of being torn apart by competing ambitions of her children. RJD sources, however, asserted that much should not be read into the development since even those not figuring among ""star campaigners"" do happen to canvass for the party, provided the candidate in the fray is willing to foot the expenses. Nonetheless, the BJP, which is now the RJD's principal rival in the state, latched on the opportunity. ""It is a clear signal to both Tej Pratap Yadav and Misa Bharti that they are no longer desired in the RJD and they must fend for themselves. Tej Pratap has already floated his own organization while Misa, a Rajya Sabha member, looks unlikely to be considered for another term,"" state BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said in a statement. The Congress, which has been left in a daze by the RJD's unilateral announcement of candidates for Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan, also appeared to be hopeful of getting something out of the dynamics of the family that controls its senior ally. Ashok Ram, who had contested the reserved Kusheshwar Asthan seat in assembly polls last year and whose son Atirek is the candidate for the bypoll, was quoted in a section of the press as saying that he will try to rope in Tej Pratap for the Congress campaign. Meanwhile, the Left Front which has been livid over former JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar switching over to the Congress, has announced its full support to the RJD in the upcoming bypolls. The CPI(ML) Liberation, the CPI and the CPI(M) together have about 20 MLAs and, along with the Congress, these are a part of the five-party Grand Alliance helmed by the RJD. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, whose JD(U) had won both seats in the assembly polls, was asked about his take on the infighting in the opposition camp. ""It is for you journalists to analyse,"" quipped Mr Kumar with a smile on his lips betraying his glee. The JD(U) has announced its candidates for both seats, which it seeks to retain with the full backing of BJP and smaller NDA partners Hindustani Awam Morcha and Vikassheel Insaan Party.   Voting is to take place on October 30 and the counting will be held on November 2. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

""I had never imagined that I would rise from the post of Chief Minister to the post of Prime Minister (but) on this day, 20 years ago, I got a new responsibility to serve the public. My journey of serving the people... living among the people... was going for many decades earlier but 20 years ago today I got a new responsibility - as the Chief Minister of Gujarat,"" he said. Prime Minister Modi first took oath as the leader of the Gujarat government on October 7, 2001. The Prime Minister's anniversary celebrations were hailed by members of his ruling BJP, including party chief JP Nadda, who listed some of the Modi government's ""achievements"" and credited him with ""implementation of decisions... for the foundation of a strong nation"". ""Be it abrogation of Article 370, law against 'triple talaq', Ram temple in Ayodhya, CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act), constitutional status to OBC commission, GST, and reservation for economically backward sections, PM Modi has resolved issues that ailed country for 70 years and implemented decisions (that) will lay the foundation of a strong nation,"" Mr Nadda declared. The BJP chief also declared Prime Minister Modi had placed India at the centre of the global stage by ensuring decisiveness against terrorism and managing international diplomacy. Others to wish PM Modi included Home Minister Amit Shah, who credited him with kickstarting the country's ""journey of good governance and development"". The BJP - which went all out to celebrate the Prime Minister's 71st birthday last month, including by orchestrating a record number of COVID-19 vaccinations (around 2.25 crore) in 24 hours - is celebrating this month by cleaning rivers, offering prayers in temples and gurudwaras, and spreading awareness about the centre's welfare schemes, according to news agency ANI.   The Prime Minister's 20th anniversary celebration comes amid a barrage of criticism from the opposition and concerned members of civil society over the government's handling of issues like the pandemic, the India-China border stand-off, the condition of the national economy and, more immediately, the death of eight people, including four farmers, at UP's Lakhimpur Kheri.

""No quarantine for India travellers to United Kingdom fully vaccinated with Covishield or another UK-approved vaccine from 11 October. Thanks to Indian government for close cooperation over last month,"" British High Commissioner to India Alex Ellis tweeted on Thursday. On October 1, in response to the UK quarantine rules for Indians and citizens of several nations, including those vaccinated with UK-approved Covishield, India had imposed mandatory 10-day quarantine for British citizens irrespective of vaccination status. Described as discriminatory and even ""colonialist"", the UK government had faced intense backlash over its refusal to recognise visitors as vaccinated unless they received their shots in a handful of select countries. ""I'm also making changes so travellers visiting England have fewer entry requirements, by recognising those with fully-vax status from 37 new countries and territories including India, Turkey and Ghana, treating them the same as UK fully vax passengers,"" Britain's Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps tweeted. ""The decision was taken after close technical cooperation between our ministries taking public health factors into account,"" a British High Commission spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday. The spokesperson said the UK keeps efficacy data and information on vaccine rollout internationally under review, and has kept visa rules under constant review throughout the pandemic to keep borders open whilst gradually and safely restarting travel. If a person isn't fully vaccinated with one of the four UK-recognised vaccines -  Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen - or any formulation of these vaccines, including Covishield, the person must take a pre-departure test, and must take a COVID-19 test on or before day 2 and on or after day 8, and self-isolate for 10 days. India's Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla had called the UK rules ""discriminatory"" and warned that ""reciprocal action"" may be warranted.   British officials had told NDTV that the issue was not the vaccine itself but the issues with India's ""vaccination certification"" process and the two sides announced ""progress"" in recognising each other's certificates after high-level talks. Dr RS Sharma, CEO of India's National Health Authority, said certification after coronavirus vaccinations in India is a centralised national system managed through the CoWIN app and portal and there are ""no issues"" with the platform which is entirely compliant with World Health Organisation standards."

A senior police officer said the accused - Gangappa - forced his way into the woman's home at 2 am and tried to rape her. When she resisted he came back with petrol from his motorcycle (parked outside the woman's home), poured it over her and set her on fire. A case has been registered at the Surpura Police Station, the senior officer said. The accused has been arrested and charged with murder and outraging the modesty of a woman. Dr CB Vedamurthy, the district SP, told NDTV two others were arrested for aiding the accused. The woman was treated for severe burns at a hospital in Kalaburagi district, where she later died. A disturbing video of her dying declaration - in which she names her attacker - has been shared on social media. In the video, she says the accused entered her home at 2 am. The woman's sister said the accused had been following her sibling for a year; he'd follow her, she said, each time she went to the fields or the toilet. The village head was told about this harassment but nothing was done, the sister claimed. ""He (the accused) went to her house at 2 am, poured petrol on her and set her on fire. (He) then locked the door and ran away,"" she said. Dr Vedamurthy told NDTV the panchayat had worked out a 'compromise' between the woman and her alleged killer, which unfortunately meant no police complaint had been filed.   He said the accused would have been booked and arrested had police been informed. The woman had been married for seven years."

The country's anti-drugs agency has been running a ""network"" in Mumbai for the last one year ""for only and only publicity,"" Mr Malik told NDTV on Thursday, hours after superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son, Aryan, was taken under judicial custody for a bail hearing in the drugs bust case. ""(Sameer) Wankhede (NCB's zonal director) after the raid that day said there were 8-10 people in NCB custody. Later in court, an officer brought 3, and then 5 accused. An officer who conducted the raid is giving vague statements. Either it was 8 or 10. Today, I am very sure that 10 people were detained that day. The NCB let off 2 people - one was the person who called everyone to the cruise ship for the raid but ended up being detained, and the other was an in-law of a BJP leader,"" Mr Malik told NDTV. ""All these are happening under Mr Wankhede. I am speaking very responsibly, I will release evidence tomorrow to prove there was a man under the NCB and a Mumbai BJP leader's in-law linked to the case,"" Mr Malik said. Mr Malik said the NCB actions are aimed at defaming the state, where the Congress and the NCP along with the BJP's former ally, Shiv Sena, is in power. ""From Rhea Chakraborty to Deepika Padukone, other celebrities or Aryan Khan, the NCB will only act wherever there is publicity involved. Many of the cases are fake; no recovery has been made,"" Mr Malik told NDTV today. ""The 'goods' are brought to the NCB's zonal director's office, and the NCB says it has 'recovered' them. No recovery has been made from any spot, any home. Photographs of so-called seized items are taken at the NCB's office only and sent out as 'media sources',"" Mr Nawab alleged. The NCP had also questioned the presence of two people along with the NCB team during the search in a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast on Sunday. One of the two men, Manish Bhanushali, is a BJP worker and had gone to the cruise ship for what he claimed was to be the NCB's eyewitness. ""After Sushant Singh Rajput's suicide, a new NCB Mumbai director was brought in. For 35 years the NCB was never involved in publicity. The publicity game started only in the last one year. They are working to defame the government and Bollywood, and trying to make a fake case of nexus between Bollywood and politicians. This is a big conspiracy to defame the government and mislead the press,"" the NCP leader told NDTV, adding the narcotics agency whose mandate is to bust big drugs rings in the country and at the international level is only defaming Maharashtra and Bollywood with a few grams of alleged seizures. Aryan Khan's lawyer Satish Manshinde had made the case that no drugs were found on him and he cannot be held responsible for the seizures made from others. But Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh had argued that the case ""has to be looked at in its entirety"".   Though no drugs was found on Aryan Khan, the NCB had made the case that his WhatsApp chats suggested involvement of international drug cartels and need deeper scrutiny. Aryan Khan also has to be confronted with a couple of men who have been arrested, the agency contended in court, referring to Achit Kumar, who they said, was arrested on the basis of Aryan Khan's statement. The agency had said Achit Kumar was the person supplying him with drugs and in the WhatsApp chats between Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha, payment for drugs were discussed."

He said the decision to have responders for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear disasters, along with rescuers to help people affected by other man-made and natural disasters, was taken after after Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently asked various agencies to enhance their capabilities in the field of disaster management. Subsequently, Union Home Minister Amit Shah asked all central forces to have this component in their establishment during a review meeting of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) held in June last year in Delhi, he said. The new CBRN teams displayed their skills during the 29th raising day celebrations of the RAF held at its 108th battalion campus on Thursday, where Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai took the salute of a ceremonial parade. The Rapid Action Force was raised in 1992 under the Central Reserve Police Force and has a total of 15 battalions at present. A single RAF battalion has a standard strength of over 1,100 personnel.

Dr RS Sharma, CEO of India's National Health Authority, said certification after coronavirus vaccinations in India is a centralised national system managed through the CoWIN app and portal and there are ""no issues"" with the platform which is entirely compliant with World Health Organisation standards."

""A raid has taken place at Umesh's residence. He was not working with Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai but with me.

According to him, I-T officials have summoned Umesh at 11 am on Friday, after which he will be able to know the reason behind the raids. To a question on ""political reasons"" at a time when the bypolls were round the corner, Yediyurappa said, ""I don't want to link the raid with politics. I-T raids are different from politics.

The I-T sleuths also conducted searches at the residences and offices of a few chartered accountants.

""This has been under discussion between our two countries for some time. It was raised and we have discussed it and explained our perspective. And discussions on this are ongoing,"" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. He was replying to a question on Sherman's comments on Wednesday on the India-Russia deal. Sherman, on a three-day visit to India, told journalists that any decision on possible sanctions on the S-400 deal will be made by President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The issue of India procuring the S-400 missile system from Russia figured in Sherman's wide-ranging talks with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Wednesday and both sides hoped to find a way out on the issue through dialogue. ""We've been quite public about any country that decides to use the S-400. We think that is dangerous and not in anybody's security interest. That said, we have a strong partnership with India,"" Sherman said. ""We want to be very thoughtful about the ways ahead, and discussions between our countries try to solve problems and I hope we will be able to in this instance as well,"" she said. Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhary on Tuesday said that the first batch of S-400 missile defence system will arrive in India from Russia by this year. The US has already imposed sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for the purchase of S-400 missile defences from Russia. In October 2018, India had signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, despite a warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions. India made the first tranche of payment of around USD 800 million to Russia for the missile systems in 2019. The S-400 is known as Russia's most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system.   Following US sanctions on Turkey, there have been apprehensions that Washington may impose similar punitive measures against India. Russian ambassador to India Nikolay Kudashev said in April that both Russia and India do not recognise bilateral sanctions as they are ""illegal tools"" of ""unlawful and unfair"" competition and pressure."

The ''Rath Yatra'' will be taken out to interact with Purvanchalis and gather their opinion on holding Chhat Puja at public places, the BJP MP said. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in its order last week had prohibited Chhath Puja celebrations at public places, including riverbank and temples, in view of COVID-19 situation. Chhath Puja celebrations were prohibited at public places in Delhi last year as well. ""The Rath Yatra will be taken out from Saturday to interact with Purvanchalis (people of Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh settled in Delhi), and gather their opinion on holding Chhath Puja at public places,"" Mr Tiwari said. Earlier this month, the Northeast Delhi BJP MP, who is also a well-known Bhojpuri actor and singer, had called a meeting of Chhath Puja committees at his residence to discuss the ban on Chhath Puja at public places. ""There is no chance of Covid spread when people celebrate Chhath in public places because devotees get into only knee-deep water while offering prayers. ""When people can enjoy swimming in the pools without any threat of Covid, how can Chhath spread it when devotees enter water for a few hours,"" he said. After the ''Rath Yatra'' is concluded, Mr Tiwari will lead a delegation that will meet Lt Governor and DDMA chairman Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to convince them to give permission for Chhat Puja celebrations at public places, said BJP leader Neelkant Bakshi. Mr Tiwari claimed that the Chhath Puja committees are ready to strictly follow all the Covid-appropriate behaviour and norms. The Delhi government can make body temperature check for entry at Chhath Puja sites and video recording the celebrations mandatory, he said. Mr Tiwari had earlier termed the ban as an ""insult"" of Purvanchalis and asserted that it will be defied if people are stopped from celebrating the festival. Chhath Puja is hugely popular among Purvanchalis. The festival celebrated after Diwali is a four-day-long ritual during the last two days of which women offer obeisance through offerings to the Sun god in ankle deep water of rivers and ponds. Purvanchalis comprise a big chunk of voters in Delhi and issues relating to them has been a favourite rallying point for the political parties. The AAP, the BJP and the Congress in Delhi pay special attention to Purvanchalis on Chhath with their senior leaders visiting ghats and ensuring facilities for them. In the pre-pandemic times, both the AAP government and municipal corporations ruled by the BJP used to spend significant amounts on preparing Chhath ghats and ensuring other facilities for the devotees.

As many as 28 civilians have been killed in terrorist violence in Kashmir this year, seven of them in the past six days. ""All killings were pistol killings which means targets have been identified and segregated,"" a senior officer in Jammu Kashmir told NDTV. The officer said Deepak Chand and Supunder Kour, the two two teachers killed in Srinagar today, were segregated on the basis of community. The officer said there had been inputs that ""pro-government voices"" and government officials would be targeted. Officials said they are collecting information on whether those killed over the past week were beneficiaries of the recent welfare schemes announced by the centre. Officials also said that the recently launched online portal for time-bound redressal of grievances of Kashmiri migrants has received good response and that has frustrated terrorists. ""Pakistan is emboldened after what happened in Kabul and for these killings they do not need big weapons and trained militants but the impact of these killings is huge,"" said a senior officer in the security grid of the Union Territory. Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Amit Shah chaired a meeting in North Block today in which he directed agencies operating in Jammu and Kashmir to tighten the security grid so that civilians, especially the minority community, does not feel threatened. The meeting was attended by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Intelligence Bureau chief Arvind Kumar and R&AW Secretary Samant Goel. Local police have been asked to ensure the safety of minorities. Some of them were also moved to security camps after terror group The Resistance Front, which has claimed responsibility for the killing of pharmacy owner Makhan Lal Bindroo in Srinagar, said they would carry out more such attacks against those found to be involved in ""anti-Kashmir"" activities. As per the Home Ministry data, a total of 28 civilians have been killed by terrorists so far this year. Out of them, five persons belonged to the local Hindu or Sikh communities and two were Hindu migrant labourers. Inspector General, Jammu and Kashmir, Vijay Kumar said terrorists' handlers are frustrated after a huge number of terrorists, including those part of their leadership, were gunned down by security forces. Out of the frustration, they had now started targeting unarmed policemen, innocent civilians and politicians, he said. ""These acts are committed by newly recruited terrorists or those who are about to join terrorist ranks. In some cases, overground workers have been found to be directly involved. Police are working hard and we are identifying all such part-time /hybrid terrorists and strictest action shall be taken against them. We have also been launching operations along with other security forces,"" said Inspector General Vijay Kumar. ""We appeal to the general public, especially minority communities, not to panic,"" he added. A retired Intelligence Bureau official who has worked in Jammu and Kashmir for over a decade said the government's ""aggressive narrative"" on various issues has hurt local sentiment. ""There are many contributing factors, leading to the increase in violence in the area,"" he said, adding that in each civilian killing, "" there is a message for the government"".    "

Speaking about how the pandemic has hit the industry hard, Dattatreya said that several theatres are struggling to pay wages to their employees. ""It is not working out. It is a problem for employees as there is no salary. In many places, employees have been fired because they are not able to pay the salaries,"" Dattatreya said.

""You think that by threatening everybody, whether this bench or threatening the other people, threatening the government, threatening others, you can make people to withdraw. You have said so. You want people to hold back by misbehaving. We are unwilling to permit you to misbehave,"" the court said. The observations were made by a bench comprising Justices S K Kaul and M M Sundresh, which deferred till January next year the sentence of the chairperson of NGO Suraz India Trust, Rajiv Daiya, who said he has tendered an unconditional apology and the court was gracious and kind enough towards him. However, the bench observed, ""We tried to be kind to you but you are not a person who takes this kindness very well. That is the whole difficulty."" Rajiv Daiya said at the outset that he had ""misinterpreted"" the top court's order. The bench said he is well-versed in the law and has been arguing constitutional issues before the court. ""It is no pleasure for us to convict somebody. That is the last resort. But you went on and on,"" it said, adding, ""You don't seem to learn a lesson."" The bench said he had moved an application tendering an unconditional apology and the court would defer the sentence. ""We will defer the sentence. Let us see how you behave,"" the bench observed, adding, ""We will defer the sentencing to January and see what is the position and then, some sentence we will impose. What we will impose, let us see."" The bench has posted the matter for January 11 next year. In its September 29 judgment holding Rajiv Daiya guilty of contempt of court, the top court had said that its power to punish for contempt is a constitutional power that cannot be abridged or taken away even by legislative enactment. The bench had said that he was clearly guilty of contempt of the court and his actions to scandalise the court cannot be countenanced. The top court had issued a contempt notice to Rajiv Daiya as to why he should not be proceeded against and sentenced for his endeavour to scandalise the court. Rajiv Daiya had told the bench that he did not have the resources to pay the cost imposed by the top court and would approach the President with a mercy plea. The top court on December 5, 2017, had refused to modify its earlier order against the NGO for filing 64 PILs. It had dismissed the plea filed by the NGO to modify the order which also barred the organisation from filing any plea before any court across the country. Since the costs were not deposited with the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Welfare Trust, the matter was put up again before the top court and notice was issued on September 29 last year. The court had on May 1, 2017, taken the punitive step and imposed a hefty cost on the NGO, saying waste of judicial time was a matter of serious concern. Referring to the details of the matters filed by the NGO and the various orders passed by the top court, the bench headed by the then Chief Justice J S Khehar had said it ""leaves no doubt that Suraz India Trust has repeatedly misused the jurisdiction of this court"".

Testifying before a powerful Congressional committee on Afghanistan, Gen (retd) H R McMaster also said it is delusional to think that any of the money that would go to the Taliban or through the Taliban for humanitarian purposes would immediately be used by the insurgent group to solidify their power and to become an even greater threat. ""So, we're in a situation where we're facing a really extraordinary dilemma that it's going to be tough for us to mitigate the humanitarian crisis without empowering the Taliban,"" he said in response to a question on Wednesday. ""I don't think we should give any assistance to Pakistan at all. I think Pakistan has had it both ways for way too long. I think Pakistan should be confronted with its behaviour over the years that has actually resulted, I think, in large measure in this outcome,"" said Mr McMaster, who served as national security advisor during the Trump Administration. It was during the Trump Administration that the US had blocked all security assistance to Pakistan. The Biden Administration has not resumed the security aid yet. ""I think we ought to hold Imran Khan responsible for his comments when Kabul fell and he said that the Afghan people have been unshackled. Why should we send a dime to Pakistan under any conditions? I think that they should be confronted with international isolation because of their support for jihadist terrorists, who are threats to humanity, including Haqqani network, the Taliban, and groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba,"" he said. Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed as well as Afghanistan-based Haqqani Network are proscribed terror entities under UNSC resolution 1267 concerning ISIL (Da'esh), al-Qaeda, and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities. Pakistani radical cleric Hafiz Saeed's Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD) is the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Taiba which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai terror attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans. Responding to a question from Congressman Scott Perry, during the Congressional hearing convened by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, McMaster said that it is a good idea to remove Pakistan's status as a major non-NATO ally. ""I would say the only time I think we have ever laid out a very clear and realistic assessment of South Asia and prioritised the strategy was President Trump's speech in August of 2017. Now, he abandoned it and he doubled down on the flaws of the Obama administration. I don't know how that happened. But I think if you go back to that August 2017 speech, that was the proper approach to Pakistan as well, which called for a suspension of all assistance to Pakistan until Pakistan fundamentally changed its behaviour,"" Mr McMaster said. Congressman Bill Keating said Pakistan remains a problem and the US needs to assess it. ""Its long standing activities, by many accounts, have been negative. I think that's putting it mildly. For decades, though, for decades, whether you go back to '96 when the Taliban took control, Pakistan was one of the first to recognise them,"" he said. ""When you go through the change in 2001 in Afghanistan and then the reconstruction of the Taliban starting around 2005, they were there giving assistance, by all accounts, and I believe those accounts are accurate. And indeed, right up into this current change in the government, Pakistan, there were many people that suggested their intelligence was embedded with them,"" Mr Keating said. Pakistan's relationship with the Haqqani network is one that is of great concern. ""That may indeed affect our relations with India in that respect. But can you comment on that? I think they have been duplicitous, not just recently, not just in the few months of this administration, but for decades in this with many administrations, Republican and Democratic alike,"" he said. Former US Ambassador to Pakistan Ryan Croker acknowledged that Pakistan worked against the US in some very fundamental aspects with their support for the Taliban. ""Earlier, I tried to present their narrative as to why. We were going to walk out, and they did not want to be left with the Taliban as a mortal enemy. They may get that anyway. And as satisfying as it would be to a lot of us, myself included, to do something to punish Pakistan for this, I don't think we have the luxury. They are already worried over the repercussions inside their own country of the Taliban's so-called victory in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""Now, we can say, 'Yeah. Well, they deserve whatever they get'. But again, a blow-up in Kashmir is going to bring a regional war. So, I think reassessment is always good, but let's reassess with a clear eye on the dangers now that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has created throughout the region. We do not need a completely destabilized Pakistani state with nuclear weapons,"" Mr Croker said. Mr McMaster told the lawmakers that the Taliban was backed by ISI and that's why they recaptured Afghanistan. ""The Taliban's differential advantage was the backing by the ISI of other groups. But it was the unscrupulous units who are willing to terrorise. They didn't give up their differential advantage. And so, I don't think it's a mystery at all why they collapsed. And I think it should be unacceptable, to disparage the Afghans who did fight, and over 60,000 of them made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve the freedoms we're now seeing,"" he said. The Taliban, he said, went around to the Afghan units, and they said, ""Hey, here's how this is going to go."" With the backing of the Pakistani spy agency ISI, intertwined with the Haqqani network and Al-Qaeda, what they did is they told those commanders, ""Hey, listen. You accommodate us. We give you the signal, or we kill your family. How does that sound?"" he said. ""And that's why the Afghan forces collapsed in addition to the withdrawal of US intelligence support, the withdrawal of our airpower, which was the Afghan forces' differential advantage,"" Mr McMaster said.

The Narcotics Control Bureau or NCB told the court today that it needs to keep Aryan Khan in custody so that it can cross-examine him in detail along with Achit Kumar who, it claims, supplied drugs to Aryan Khan. But it has had plenty of time to do so already, argued Aryan Khan's lawyer. ""How long does it take them to download the chats? The chats are about football, and football does not contain any drugs,"" Mr Maneshinde told the court. Aryan Khan was arrested on Saturday after a raid on a cruise ship that was to travel from Mumbai to Goa. A total of 16 people have been arrested so far including those that helped organize the event. The court denied extension of custody and sent Aryan Khan and the other accused to judicial custody. The bail hearing is at 11 am tomorrow. Among those arrested is Arbaaz Merchant, who is 26 years old and is a friend of Aryan Khan. ""Aryan Khan and my son are being made scapegoats,"" Aslam Merchant, his father, told NDTV today.   Shah Rukh Khan has not commented so far on the investigation or through his lawyers or other representatives.

Farooq Abdullah On Kashmir Targeted Killings","Innocent people are dying and the government should re-assess its policies rather than insist everything is ""hunky dory"", former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah told NDTV Thursday, hours after the principal and teacher at a government school were shot dead in Srinagar. The killings are the latest in a series of targeted murders in the Kashmir valley, and a furious Mr Abdullah asked ""are we going back to the 1990s (when terrorist activities in Kashmir were at a peak)""? ""Teachers are being killed, local residents are being killed... Such things have not happened since the 1990s. There is no doubt it (terrorism) is escalating... this is worrisome for us all. The centre must see why this is happening... is there any policy leading to this?"" Mr Abdullah told NDTV. ""When they say (Article) 370 is removed and everything is hunky-dory... Is this hunky-dory? I want to ask Home Minister (Amit Shah). I have friends in the minority communities and they are scared... political leaders are scared they will be the next target. For god's sake, India must wake up,"" he said. Mr Abdullah, who was detained under the stringent PSA (Public Safety Act) for an extended period after the government scrapped Article 370 in August 2019, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Kashmir and offer personal reassurances of safety to the residents. ""Ask yourself - is terrorism in Kashmir coming down or going up? They (the centre) are telling us something (but) the reality is something totally different. People are worried here, people are scared... Pray. India must pray. Let us hope we don't see a rise in such incidents,"" he told NDTV. Mr Abdullah also questioned the centre's intentions towards Kashmir, declaring that despite promises that political leaders still in detention would be released, ""none of that has happened"". As many as five civilians have been killed over the past three days, including Makhan Lal Bindroo, 70, a prominent chemist in Srinagar. Mr Bindroo was shot inside his store, from point-blank range, around 7 pm on Tuesday. He was rushed to a nearby hospital but was declared dead on arrival. The two others killed on Tuesday were Virender Paswan, a street food vendor in downtown Srinagar who hailed from Bihar, and Mohammad Shafi, the president of a taxi stand in Bandipora.

It has earlier stated that the young celebrity did not have any drugs on him when the raid took place. The bail application will be heard tomorrow at 11 am. Aryan Khan was present in court in a dark blue-coloured sweatshirt and a baseball cap, as his lawyer, Satish Maneshinde countered that he had been invited as a Bollywood celebrity to the cruise, and had not boarded the ship when he was searched for drugs. ""I was invited as one of the persons connected to Bollywood and add glamour"".  He added, ""They asked me if I was carrying drugs and I said no, they searched by bag and found nothing."" Aryan Khan is listed as Accused No 1 in the case that has generated front-page headlines. ""Question is it is one connected case and we have to establish the entire conspiracy and the deal. We cannot be segregating them. It cannot be done. The purpose of the agency is to find out the real culprit and the entire gang. Or else it will continue forever,"" argued Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, referencing the allegation that Aryan Khan has information on a chain of drug suppliers. Shah Rukh Khan has not commented so far on the investigation or through his lawyers or other representatives. Aryan Khan was arrested on Saturday after a raid on a cruise ship that was to travel from Mumbai to Goa. A total of 16 people have been arrested so far including those that helped organize the event. Among those arrested is Arbaaz Merchant, who is 26 years old and is a friend of Aryan Khan. ""Aryan Khan and my son are being made scapegoats,"" Aslam Merchant, his father, told NDTV today.

But it has had plenty of time to do so already, argued Aryan Khan's lawyer. The agency had earlier said that it had not found any drugs on Aryan Khan but suggested that WhatsApp chats that allegedly involve him need further scrutiny as they point to the supply of drugs by an international cartel. Today, the NCB said that Aryan Khan needs to be confronted with Achit Kumar, whose custody has been extended by the court till Saturday. Among the many controversies surrounding his arrest is the fact that a private detective of sorts was allowed access to him after he was removed from the ship; he also took a selfie with the superstar's son and was filmed holding Aryan Khan as he was escorted into the NCB's office.   Separately, a man who describes himself as a BJP worker for ""15-16 years"" has told NDTV that he tipped off the agency about the cruise and was therefore part of the raid. The BJP worker, Manish Bhanushali, said to NDTV today, ""I received information about drug peddlers and what they were going to do in the party. I am a BJP worker for the last 10-15 years... Just because I am a BJP worker they are targeting me... The NCB had information and I too had information, and that's how we conducted the raid together."" Legal experts as well as a Maharashtra minister have said the role and access of outsiders amounts to a brazen violation of basic laws and rules that are to be followed by law enforcement agencies."

The suspect, Josef Schuetz, stands accused of ""knowingly and willingly"" assisting in the murder of 3,518 prisoners at the Sachsenhausen camp in Oranienburg, north of Berlin, between 1942 and 1945. Allegations against him include aiding and abetting the ""execution by firing squad of Soviet prisoners of war in 1942"" and the murder of prisoners ""using the poisonous gas Zyklon B"". More than seven decades after World War II, German prosecutors are racing to bring the last surviving Nazi perpetrators to justice, and have in recent years increasingly focused attention on lower-ranking Nazi staff. The case comes a week after a 96-year-old German woman, who was a secretary in a Nazi death camp, dramatically fled before the start of her trial, but was caught several hours later. She, too, has been charged with complicity in murder. Her trial resumes on October 19. Despite his advanced age, a medical assessment in August found that Schuetz was fit to stand trial, although the Neuruppin court will limit his hearings to a couple of hours a day. Schuetz arrived with a walking aid for the proceedings, held in a sports hall given the huge interest in the case. The trial is scheduled to last until early January. ""He is not accused of having shot anyone in particular, but of having contributed to these acts through his work as a guard and of having been aware such killings were happening at the camp,"" a court spokeswoman said. Thomas Walther, a lawyer representing several camp survivors and victims' relatives in the case, said that even 76 years on from the war, such trials were necessary. ""There's no expiry date on justice,"" he told AFP. One of his clients is Antoine Grumbach, 79, who hopes Schuetz will shed light on the methods used to kill people in the camp, but also that the accused ""will say 'I was wrong, I am ashamed'"". - 'Symbolic' - The Nazi SS guard worked at the Sachsenhausen camp which detained more than 200,000 people between 1936 and 1945, including Jews, Roma, regime opponents and gay people. Tens of thousands of inmates died from forced labour, murder, medical experiments, hunger or disease before the camp was liberated by Soviet troops, according to the Sachsenhausen Memorial and Museum. Little is known about the accused, beyond the fact that he was released from captivity as a prisoner of war in 1947 and went to work as a locksmith in the Brandenburg region of what was then Communist East Germany, the Bild newspaper reported. The file against him was transferred by the central unit investigating Nazi crimes to the state of Brandenburg, where he lives, in April 2019, and charges were eventually filed on January 26 this year. Co-plaintiff Christoffel Heijer, 84, told AFP his father was shot dead in the camp in May 1942. ""My mother received a letter from him on May 3, 1942, before he was shot. When she learnt a few days later that he had died, she cried a lot and went grey almost at once,"" he said. The accused's lawyer, Stefan Waterkamp, said his client ""has stayed silent"" so far on the charges against him. Schuetz remains free during the trial. Even if convicted, he is highly unlikely to be put behind bars given his advanced age. - Race against time - Germany has been hunting down former Nazi staff since the 2011 conviction of former guard John Demjanjuk, on the basis that he served as part of Hitler's killing machine, set a legal precedent. Since then, courts have handed down several guilty verdicts on those grounds rather than for murders or atrocities directly linked to the individual accused. Among those brought to late justice were Oskar Groening, an accountant at Auschwitz, and Reinhold Hanning, a former SS guard at Auschwitz. Both were convicted at the age of 94 of complicity in mass murder, but died before they could be imprisoned. Most recently, former SS guard Bruno Dey was found guilty at the age of 93 last year and was given a two-year suspended sentence.   Prosecutors are investigating eight other cases, according to the Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes.

Focusing on biodiversity, COP15 is less well known than its sister climate summit but deals with issues that are no less vital to the health of the planet, such as fighting pollution, protecting ecosystems and preventing mass extinction. The online session beginning on Monday will be followed by a face-to-face gathering in late April, where a final pact for nature will be hammered out. - Who is involved? - Discussions at the COP15 are grounded in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), a treaty ratified by 195 countries and the European Union -- but not the United States, the world's biggest historical polluter. Parties meet every two years. The CBD was drafted in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. Its stated goals are to preserve the diversity of species on Earth and set guidelines on how to exploit natural resources sustainably and justly. This year's gathering, originally set for 2020, was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. - Why does nature need protection? - Plants and animals are disappearing at an accelerating rate due to human activity -- habitat encroachment, over-exploitation, pollution, the spread of invasive species and, more recently, climate change. ""Biodiversity is declining at unprecedented rates,"" CBD executive secretary Elizabeth Maruma Mrema told AFP in an interview. ""About one million animal and plant species out of 8.1 million are threatened with extinction -- more than ever before in human history."" Humanity's expanding footprint is also undermining the ecosystems that produce the clean air, drinkable water, food, medicine and raw materials we need to survive. ""Our relationship with nature must change,"" said Maruma Mrema. The Covid-19 pandemic, thought to have originated from a virus in wild animals, is a ""brutal reminder"" of the price we can pay for neglecting or abusing nature, she said. - What has the CBD achieved? - At the 2010 biodiversity summit in Aichi, Japan, CBD member states laid out 20 goals to preserve biological diversity and reduce human pressures on the environment, setting a 2020 deadline for achieving them. None of the objectives was fulfilled by that deadline, and -- with a few exceptions -- conditions are generally worse today than when the goals were first set. This year's negotiations will likely see a new set of targets designed to allow our species to ""live in harmony with nature"", with a 2050 deadline and 2030 checkpoints. - What are this year's goals? - The draft text under negotiation, the Framework Biodiversity Convention, provisionally sets 21 ""targets"" for 2030. These include according protected status to 30 percent of lands and oceans, a measure supported by a broad coalition of nations, including France and Costa Rica. Another goal is to halve the use of fertilisers so that less of the nitrogen-rich substance leaches into fresh and ocean waters. The draft pact also calls for reducing pesticide use by at least two thirds, and for halting the discharge of plastic waste entirely. Another measure would see subsidies for environmentally harmful industries reduced by ""at least $500 billion per year"". Without money and enforcement, however, these measures risk becoming empty promises, experts warn. - Are COP15 and COP26 linked? - Yes and no. Negotiations under the two conventions unfold on separate tracks and do not intersect. But parties to both treaties are increasingly looking for overlapping solutions. ""We cannot solve climate change without biodiversity and we cannot solve biodiversity loss without climate change,"" Maruma Mrema said. ""They are two intertwined crises and they need to be addressed together."" Healthy ecosystems -- especially forest and oceans -- make better carbon sinks to absorb CO2 pollution. These in turn are vital to keep global warming down to levels that are survivable for humanity and other species. - What is China's role? - Maruma Mrema says that China's status as host for the negotiations means the world's top carbon polluter and most populous nation will be ""taking global leadership on the biodiversity agenda"". A statement known as the Kunming Declaration to be unveiled at the opening next week will set the tone for China's leadership, said Li Shuo, global policy advisor for Greenpeace China. ""Beijing has the task of rescuing a weak environmental convention from the verge of a reputational collapse,"" he said.   ""It carries the mission to boost biodiversity protection to the same rank as climate change, a task that has proven beyond its reach so far.""

""If they disappear, we'll disappear with them,"" he says of the vibrant corals on the reef, a species-rich ecosystem just below the turquoise waters that is beloved by diving enthusiasts worldwide. Coral reefs -- often dubbed the ""rainforests of the oceans"" for their rich biodiversity -- are under threat everywhere as rising sea temperatures and acidification cause catastrophic ""bleaching"" events. Along with pollution and dynamite fishing, global warming wiped out 14 percent of the world's coral reefs between 2009 and 2018, says a new survey by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, the biggest ever carried out. Some studies have suggested that many species of coral in the Red Sea -- which is also bordered by the Saudi peninsula, Sudan and Eritrea -- are unusually heat-resistant, but local professionals say they have already witnessed the damage. ""We can see the effects of global warming before our eyes,"" said Islam Mohsen, 37, another local diving instructor at the resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh. ""We can see the coral discolouring and turning white."" - Biodiversity hotspots - Coral reefs cover only a tiny fraction -- 0.2 percent -- of the ocean floor, but they are home to at least a quarter of all marine animals and plants. The Red Sea and Gulf of Aden boast the most biologically diverse coral reef communities outside of Southeast Asia. The Red Sea -- with just over five percent of the world's coral reefs -- is home to 209 types of coral, according to Egypt's environment ministry. The new global survey said that live hard coral cover in the region fluctuated over recent decades but declined overall, from 36.1 percent in 1997 to 34.3 percent in 2019. Causes for the degraded reefs varied by location but included tourism activities, coastal development, land runoff and overfishing, the report said. Steps have been taken in Egypt to protect reefs and marine life that are crucial to the local tourism sector. Egypt's Chamber of Diving and Water Sports -- which oversees 269 diving centres and over 2,900 professional divers -- has protected fragile areas with buoys to keep boats from mooring. It has also suspended beginners' diving classes in some areas to allow damaged reefs to recover. But the largest looming threat, far harder to fix, is global warming. - Marine heatwaves - Oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions, shielding land surfaces but generating huge, long-lasting marine heatwaves. These are pushing many species of corals past their limits of tolerance. ""When the temperature of the ocean goes up, it absorbs more carbon dioxide, which creates carbonic acid,"" said Cairo-based climate change consultant Katherine Jones. ""So not only will the temperature increase, but the PH level will change too,"" affecting all animals with shells, she said. ""We will lose a lot of wildlife, and the ecosystem will be changing in a way that affects us as humans in terms of resources. ""The coral reefs are nurseries to baby fish and a feeding ground to bigger fish ... it's an essential part of the ecosystem."" Sharm El-Sheikh hosted a United Nations agencies conference in 2018 that called for the protection of coral reefs ""before it's too late"". Egypt also plans to host the Climate Conference of the Parties (COP27) in November next year. A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that up to 90 percent of coral reefs ""may be gone by mid-century"" even if the rise in temperatures stabilises below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Jones warned that, as things stand now, climate change and its impacts can no longer be reversed -- only slowed -- to prevent the worst consequences.   ""Even if humans completely disappear from Earth tomorrow or we stopped producing any kind of emissions,"" she said, ""the temperature will continue to rise by itself.""

A bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, while asking the Centre to allow women to take the entrance exam for admission this year in RIMC instead of waiting till June 2022, directed the government to publish a modified advertisement within two days to seek applications from women. Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that preparations for the upcoming December 18 exam were already at an advanced stage and urged it to allow for the induction of women into the RIMC and Rashtriya Military School (RMS) for the term beginning from January 2023 and not June 2022. The bench, however, was not convinced with the decision of the Centre and ordered that girls will be allowed to sit in the entrance exam this year itself. Earlier, the bench had directed the Defence ministry to allow women candidates to sit for upcoming exams for the National Defence Academy. The Supreme Court now posted the matter for hearing in January 2023 along with the matter relating to the induction of women into the armed forces through the NDA. The Army Training Command has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court in the case stating that it is making arrangements to admit women cadets and candidates to RIMC and Rashtriya Military Schools (RMCs) from the academic session 2022-23. The Supreme Court was hearing a petition filed by advocate Kailas Udhavrao More against the exclusion of women candidates from the Rashtriya Indian Military School and other schools and colleges run under the aegis of the Defence ministry like Indian Military College, Sainik School, and National Yacht training school.   The affidavit stated, ""Admission to RIMC is done through an All India Competitive examination held biannually in June and December every year for admission in January and July. All states of the union are allotted one seat while Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal allotted two seats, UP allotted three seats. The gradual process to be followed: Increase capacity from 250 to 300 incrementally by inducting five girls per six months. The girls will be allowed to take the RIMC entrance examination scheduled in June 2022 for entry into RIMC for the term starting in January 2023."" In Phase 2, there is a plan to increase the capacity from 300 to 350 and to induct 10 women every month and at the end of that expansion, RIMC will have 250 men and 100 women, it added."

Meanwhile, Senior Advocate Harsh Vaidyanathan appeared for MEA, assured the court that the Mission in Iran is in touch with the petitioners and being provided all the best possible help. Mission had facilitated the five seafarers with boarding and lodging facility and Groceries is provided to them and weekly basis, MEA told Advocate Gurinder Pal Singh, who appeared for the petitioner submits that the stranded seafarers are still not provided consular service. The bench of Justice Rekha Palli on Thursday granted more time to MEA to file a status report regarding steps taken by it and slated the matter for December 21, 2021. The Court had earlier issued notice to MEA on a plea of families of five seafarers stranded in Iran, sought direction to provide legal and counsellor service to seafarers and secure their repatriation. The family also sought direction to the Centre to actively pursue the matter with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for expeditious disposal of the matter by the Supreme Court of Iran. According to the plea, all the petitioners come from very humble backgrounds. On completion of their marine course, the seafarers have assured a job in the United Arab Emirates. They flew separately to the UAE but to their great shock and dismay and contrary to what was represented to them by their placement agents, they were taken to Iran where they joined a Cargo vessel MV Artin 10 as Seafarers performing only menial duties.

Later, the seafarers were informed later that the matter had been referred to the Supreme Court of Iran. They were further informed that by June 23, 2021, the matter would be finally decided by the Supreme Court.   ""Till date, the Government of India and more particularly the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian Embassy in Tehran have not taken any steps to provide any assistance, financial or legal whatsoever to them which they were entitled to, being Indian Citizens.

Four others -- a journalist, two BJP worker and a driver -- were also killed in violence. The police have registered a case against 13 people. Amid calls for his sacking, Union Minister Ajay Mishra has ruled out resigning. While Mr Mishra has admitted the car that ran over protesters was his, both he and his son have denied that they were present during the incident.   Mr Mishra was the chief guest at a meeting of prison officials today. The Border Security Force, a paramilitary force under his ministry, was deployed to keep the media out. The petitioner told NDTV: ""I decided to write to the Chief Justice as a conscious citizen of a democratic country. If one can't get justice even in a democracy, then where else will justice happen? I was disturbed by the videos of the farmers being mowed down, especially that old farmer."""

Prime Minister Scott Morrison's comments suggest he would favour making companies like Facebook Inc liable for defamation with regards to some content posted by third parties, a position that could further cement Australia's outlier status on the subject. The country's highest court ruled last month that publishers can be held liable for public comments on online forums, a judgement that has pitted Facebook and news organisations against each other and spread alarm among all sectors that engage with the public via social media. That in turn has lent new urgency to an ongoing review of Australia's defamation laws, with the federal attorney general this week writing to state counterparts stressing the importance of tackling the issue. ""Social media has become a coward's palace where people can go on there, not say who they are, destroy people's lives, and say the most foul and offensive things to people, and do so with impunity,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra. ""They should have to identify who they are, and the companies, if they're not going to say who they are, well, they're not a platform anymore, they're a publisher. You can expect us to be leaning further into this,"" he added. A Facebook spokesperson did not directly respond to a Reuters question about Morrison's remarks, but said the company was actively engaging with the review. ""We support modernisation of Australia's uniform defamation laws and hope for greater clarity and certainty in this area,"" the spokesperson said. ""Recent court decisions have reaffirmed the need for such law reform."" A representative for Twitter Inc's Australian unit did not address the question of potential liability but said ""anonymity or pseudonymity is not a shield against Terms of Service violations, and Twitter will take action against any accounts that are in violation of the Twitter Rules"". Since the court ruling, CNN, which is owned by AT&T Inc, has blocked Australians from its Facebook pages https://www.reuters.com/technology/cnn-quits-facebook-australia-citing-defamation-risk-2021-09-29, citing concern about defamation liability, while the Australian arm of British newspaper the Guardian says it has disabled comments below most articles posted to the platform. Australia has butted heads with Facebook previously, enacting a new law this year that forces it and Google to pay for links to media companies' content. REVIEW IN FOCUS Federal Attorney-General Michaelia Cash said in an Oct. 6 letter to state counterparts that she had ""received considerable feedback from stakeholders regarding the potential implications of the High Court's decision"". ""While I refrain from commenting on the merits of the Court's decision, it is clear ... that our work to ensure that defamation law is fit-for-purpose in the digital age remains critical,"" said the letter which was seen by Reuters. No timeline has been given for how long the review might last. New South Wales state Attorney General Mark Speakman, who is leading it, said media, social media and law firms attended three consultations in the past month. The review, which has been running through 2021, has published 36 submissions on its website, including one from Facebook which says it should not be held liable for defamatory comments since it has relatively little ability to monitor and remove content posted under publishers' pages. While news outlets were among the first to criticise the ruling, lawyers have warned all Australian sectors which rely on social media to interact with the public are potentially liable. ""The decision has significant implications for those who operate online forums ... which allow third-parties to make comments,"" a Law Council of Australia spokesperson said. ""It is not limited to news organisations.""   The leaders of the state of Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, home to Canberra, are among those who have disabled comments from Facebook pages, citing the High Court ruling.

Of the eight killed, four were farmers, who were allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to an event in the area.

Almost three hundred people including dozens of foreign nationals were killed in the April 21 attacks on three churches and three luxury hotels, in a wave of killings targeting Sri Lanka's Christian community. Prosecutors have brought over 20,000 charges against the suspects, three of whom have already been accused of terrorism by the US Justice Department. The suspects are in police custody, but one of them did not appear in court Monday as he was suffering from Covid-19, officials said, adding that hearings will begin on November 23. Prosecutors told the court that US and Australian forensic experts assisted investigators in tracking down the backers of the eight-member suicide squad responsible for the attacks. Sri Lanka authorities have accused their ringleader, Mohamed Naufar, of being the mastermind of the deadly suicide bombings and of being a member of the Islamic State group. Former police chief Pujith Jayasundara and top defence official Hemasiri Fernando are also being prosecuted separately for failing to act on repeated intelligence warnings of a possible IS attack. An inquiry set up by former president Maithripala Sirisena found that he too was responsible for failing to prevent the attack and should be prosecuted.   The head of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, has repeatedly said he is unhappy with the lack of progress in the inquiry into the Easter bombings.

A few days ago, the Crime Branch had taken jailed gangster Tillu Tajpuriya - one of the prime conspirators - in its custody to question him about Jitender Gogi's killing. Followed by his interrogation, jailed gangster Naveen Balli was also taken into custody on Tuesday for two days in connection with the incident. According to police, Naveen Balli was involved in the conspiracy to kill Jitender Gogi. It was on his instructions that one of his associates Naveen Hooda had brought a Nepali citizen to Rohini court in a lawyer's dress armed with weapons on the day of the incident to join Rahul and Jagga, the other assailants. Both Tillu Tajpuriya and Naveen Balli were lodged in jail number 15 of Mandoli prison. Jailed gangster Sunil Rathee is also suspected to have played a role and is under the scanner. A preliminary investigation into the case had revealed that the instruction to kill Jitender Gogi was given on phone by Tillu Tajpuriya. Tajpuriya was in touch with his associates over VoIP call directing them on how to execute the plan, police had said. The Special Cell of the Delhi Police had also arrested Umang Yadav and Vinay from a flat in northwest Delhi's Haiderpur area in connection with the shootout and their custody was later handed over to the Crime Branch which is probing the case, police officials had said. Two assailants shot dead Jitender Gogi inside the Rohini court on September 24. Both then were killed in retaliatory firing by the police.   The Gogi and Tillu gangs are reportedly at war for years and their rivalry has claimed dozens of lives. To attain supremacy, these two gangs have formed alliances with other inter-state gangsters.

It was the first instance of a regulatory agency pledging to look into misdeeds at Prevent Senior, a major healthcare chain serving tens of thousands of patients in the Sao Paulo area. Paulo Rebello Filho, head of the National Regulatory Agency for Private Health Insurance Plans (ANS), said his staff has detected ""assistance abnormalities"" at Prevent Senior and the health chain will be put under special technical supervision. At least nine people died of COVID-19 during the trials at Prevent Senior from March to April 2020, but their charts were altered to hide the cause of death, the inquiry was told last week by a lawyer for 10 whistleblowing doctors. The Senators were told the hospital chain sought to validate far-right President Jair Bolsonaro's policy of advocating the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID patients. Prevent Senior has said the accusations, including the altering of patient charts and the firing of doctors who opposed the practice, are unfounded. Rebello said the ANS opened an administrative process to investigate irregularities at Prevent Senior and has sent officials to verify ""indications of operational failures."" Closer monitoring is not aimed at removing the hospital chain from the market but seeks to guarantee maintenance of quality care, he said. The regulator head said he had no knowledge of the allegations made by the doctors until they presented to the Senate inquiry.   In a statement, Prevent Senior said it had not been officially notified of the ANS decision. It said it had provided the regulator with documents that show it acted within ethical and regulatory norms.

Mahavir, who hails from Patna, is pursuing B.tech from IIT-Kharagpur. According to the police, he harassed over 50 girl students and teachers of a reputed school in north Delhi. They said Mahavir used apps for fake caller ID and virtual numbers on WhatsApp to contact the victims. To hide his identity, he also used a voice changing app. He posted morphed photos of the victims on fake Instagram profiles created by him in their names, the police said. The matter came to light after a complaint was received from the school administration on Wednesday regarding cyber stalking. According to the complaint, the accused stalked minor girls on social media and sent them messages on WhatsApp. He called the teachers from various international numbers and harassed them. The IIT student joined the WhatsApp groups created for online classes and also entered the classes, the complaint stated.

Mizoram crossed one lakh Covid cases yesterday with 1,471 people testing positive for the virus. The positivity rate in Mizoram stands at 15.36 per cent and is a major cause of concern in the state with a total population of just over 11 lakh. Headed by National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) consultant-epidemiologist Dr Vinita Gupta, the central team arrived in the state capital Aizawl on Tuesday. Aizawl has reported 65 per cent of the total cases of the state so far. The central team virtually held a review meeting with chief medical officers of all 11 districts on Wednesday. To tackle the sudden surge in Covid cases, the state-level expert team on COVID-19 management has underlined the importance of focussing more on symptomatic patients and high-risk patients including pregnant women, elderly people and those with comorbidities. Although Mizoram's fatality rate is among the lowest in the country- 0.33 per cent against the national average of 1.33 per cent, the state's low recovery rate of 84.40 per cent against the national average of 97.94 per cent is worrying. Another cause of alarm is the number of active cases which are currently at 15,006 cases.   Headed by Dr F Lallianhlira, the state-level expert team has submitted a report to the government seeking revision of the standard operating procedure (SOP) for Covid testing and home isolation. Despite the spike in cases, Mizoram issued new COVID-19 guidelines last week allowing re-opening of churches twice a week- Saturday and Sunday- during daytime with 50 per cent seating capacity. Additionally, re-opening of public parks, social and public gatherings with 50 per cent attendance has also been allowed."

Stay-at-home orders will be lifted for the Harbour City's five-million-plus people now that 70 percent of state residents over 16 have been double jabbed. ""The light at the end of the tunnel is now very, very close,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Thursday, hailing the reopening announcement. From Monday, pubs, restaurants and shops will throw open their shutters and welcome back the fully vaccinated. Five-kilometre travel restrictions will also be lifted, although state and international borders will remain closed for now. The reopening -- described by many as ""freedom day"" -- is both ""exciting"" and ""nerve-racking"" according to Alyce Murphy, general manager of The Carrington, a Sydney pub now hustling to get staff and deliveries back on site. ""Obviously going from doing nothing for months, and then the prospect of having a few weeks to get the venue there was a little bit daunting,"" she said. Murphy tried to fill the almost four-month lockdown with activities such as painting and gardening. But like millions of Australians, she ""also just sat on the couch and watched TV a lot"". Lockdown Under Australia has been spared the worst of the pandemic -- recording 1,379 deaths in a population of around 26 million. But for the last 18 months, under-vaccinated Australian cities have endured several gruelling lockdowns to limit the spread of the virus. Jobs have been lost, kids have missed being at school for a large portion of the academic year, and restrictions have sparked a string of mostly small but noisy protests and a flood of online misinformation. There is growing evidence that locked-down Australians have been drinking more and existing mental conditions have worsened, according to a recent report by the country's Mental Health Think Tank. In recent months, Australia's repeated imposition of restrictions and efforts -- now abandoned -- to reach ""Covid Zero"" have brought it international attention.  The conservative-run country has become an unlikely lightning rod for the American right keen to vent against vaccine mandates and lockdowns everywhere. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis -- whose state has recorded 55,000-plus deaths in a population slightly smaller than Australia -- even suggested breaking off diplomatic relations. ""It's not a free country at all,"" he said. ""Is Australia freer than communist China right now? I don't know."" Thousands of Australian residents have also chafed at the restrictions, and some have voted with their feet. The country's population has shrunk for the first time since World War I, as expatriates returned home in droves. That has hit the hospitality and retail sectors which report staff shortages and logistics bottlenecks at warehouses that could make reopening difficult. 'Critical time' Some medical experts are also concerned that New South Wales state, of which Sydney is the capital, may be reopening too soon. The government's own health advice from the Doherty Institute recommended widespread reopening when vaccination rates reached 80 percent rather than the current 70 percent. The Australian Medical Association warned Thursday that infections will rise with reopening and underfunded hospitals risk being overwhelmed. ""New South Wales must not be reckless at this critical time,"" the group's president Omar Khorshid said. ""That would cost more lives, cause more suffering, and put the economies of New South Wales and the nation at risk.""   But recently installed state premier Dominic Perrottet was adamant about the reopening. On Thursday, he brought forward the date for most schools to resume and said masks would not be needed in offices.    Both measures are designed to get people back to work.

Terrorists stormed into the Government Boys Higher Secondary School in Srinagar's Eidgah area and shot the principal and the teacher at close range, a government official said. There were no students in the school as classes are still online. The attack comes less than 48 hours after three persons were shot dead in strikes on Tuesday. Seven people have been killed in terror attacks in Kashmir in the last five days. The police chief of Jammu and Kashmir said the terror outfit ""The Resistance Front"" (TRF) is behind today's attack. The victims were from Kashmir's minority Sikh and Hindu communities. The teacher, Deepak Chand, was a Hindu from Jammu and the principal, Supunder Kour, was a Sikh. ""The pistol-wielding men came into the school this morning and asked for the identity cards of the teachers and later fired at two teachers, one each from the minority Sikh and Hindu community,"" news agency Reuters quoted a school teacher as saying.

He said the area has been cordoned off and a hunt has been launched for the attackers. ""TRF is run from Karachi. We will soon expose this nexus from across (the border).

""I strongly condemn the barbaric killing of two of our teachers, Supinder Kour and Deepak Chand by terrorists. A befitting reply will be given to the perpetrators of the heinous terror attacks on innocent people,"" Mr Sinha tweeted.

Words of condemnation are not enough for this inhuman act of terror but I pray for the souls of the deceased to rest in peace,"" he tweeted. On Tuesday, 70-year-old Makhan Lal Bindroo, a prominent businessman and the owner of a pharmacy in Srinagar's Iqbal Park, was shot at from point-blank range inside his store around 7 pm, the police said. He was immediately rushed to a hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival. The police and security forces rushed to the spot but his attackers had already escaped.

Aryan Khan, 23, was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Monday along with seven others. ""I've known you as a kid and I've known you as a man. Own it. Own everything you experience. They are your gifts. Trust me. In time when you connect the dots... I promise you, It's gonna make sense,"" Hrithik Roshan wrote in the note posted on Instagram, along with a photo of Aryan.

Agents acting for Mohammed were weeks away from exchanging contracts on the 30 million pound ($41 million) Parkwood estate when the sheikh's team decided to pull out of the deal. His ex-wife, Jordanian Princess Haya bint al-Hussein, had raised the matter at the High Court in London as part of a legal battle, according to a published judgment. Judge Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division in England and Wales, who has previously ruled that the Gulf ruler had waged a threatening campaign against Haya since she fled to England in 2019, said she justifiably regarded the property move as frightening. ""There can be no doubt that this deliberate behaviour, both in negotiating a purchase and then withholding information about it, by those who are acting for the benefit of the Dubai ruling family, will have had the effect of intimidating this mother to a very marked degree,"" he said in a ruling published on Wednesday. Haya said she feared the plans would allow the sheikh - who the judge has also ruled hacked her phone and those of her lawyers - to spy on her or possibly try to abduct their two children. ""It feels like I am being stalked ... the prospect of Sheikh Mohammed, or those on his behalf buying the properties around Castlewood is terrifying and utterly wearing,"" she said in a written statement to the court. Haya's lawyers said they first became aware of the sheikh's plans in late 2019, and unsuccessfully sought confirmation from his legal team that he would not to buy any properties near her Castlewood home in Berkshire, close to Windsor Great Park where Queen Elizabeth's son Prince Andrew's home is located. In late 2020, Haya received information that a trust connected to Mohammed was trying to buy the 72-acre Parkwood estate immediately abutting Castlewood, which had been left to her by her father, the late King Hussein of Jordan. After the sheikh's lawyers failed to reply to requests from Haya's legal team about the intended purchase, in November 2020 they responded to a direct request from the High Court to confirm the trust was in the process of buying Parkwood and it might well take place in the next few weeks. The same month, those acting for the sheikh confirmed they would not go ahead with the purchase of the estate, which McFarlane said ""comprises, according to press reports, the most expensive development land currently on the market"". ""Quite simply, if it were not for the mother's persistence and my Lord's assistance in demanding an answer, the purchase of a property sitting right on top of the mother would have gone ahead,"" Haya's lawyer Charles Geekie said. ""It is an absolute game changer when the threat is on your doorstep."" Mohammed's lawyer told the court that the trust behind the property dealings regularly sought commercial opportunities in the area. The following month, the judge agreed to extend a ""non-molestation order"" against Mohammed. This included a 100-metre exclusion zone around Castlewood for the father or those acting for him, a no-fly zone to stop aircraft or drones flying between the ground and 1,000ft above her estate, and a wider area in which he could not buy or rent any property.   The sheikh's lawyers had argued that Haya's initial request for a 14.8 km (9 mile) exclusion zone would have prevented him from being able to access Windsor and Ascot racecourses and Windsor Castle, Queen Elizabeth's residence to the west of London, and McFarlane said he agreed to ""radically"" reduce its size.

On Lakhimpur, Top Court Asks UP For Report Tomorrow","Four days after a group of farmers were run over by a Union Minister's car in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri, the Supreme Court demanded to know today ""how many have been arrested"" and asked for a status report tomorrow from the state government. The court asked the government to file a status report tomorrow specify action taken and details of the eight who were killed on Sunday during a protest against Union Minister Ajay Mishra's visit. ""We need to know whom you registered an FIR against and how many have you arrested,"" the Supreme Court told the Yogi Adityanath government. ""In the status report also tell us about the eight persons who have been killed. Farmers, journalist etc. It is an unfortunate incident. Tell us whom you registered FIR against. How many have you arrested,"" the Supreme Court questioned. A new video that emerged yesterday made it clear that the protest at Lakhimpur Kheri was peaceful until Junior Home Minister Ajay Mishra's convoy rammed protesters from behind.  His son Ashish Mishra has been accused of driving the SUV that ran over farmers. An FIR has been registered against Ashish Mishra but he has yet to be arrested or even questioned. ""A number of farmers have died due to the negligence of authorities. We requested that the court should take appropriate action regarding the issue. It's a human right violation,"" said lawyer Shivkumar Tripathi, who had written to the Chief Justice of India NV Ramana. According to Mr Tripathi, the UP government ""has not taken the kind of action that is needed in a democratic process"" and its action was delayed. He asked for an FIR ""because farmers are suffering and are afraid"". The Uttar Pradesh government told the court that an FIR had been filed and an inquiry by a former judge would look into the allegations. ""The grievance is that you are not registering a proper FIR and a proper investigation not taking place,"" Chief Justice Ramana said. The Chief Justice also said the court had received a message during the hearing that the mother of one of the farmers killed in the incident was in a critical state. ""During the hearing we have received a message that the mother of one of the deceased is in a critical medical condition post the loss of her son. We direct the UP government to assist her with medical care immediately,"" said the Chief Justice. ""Admit her to nearest government medical college,"" directed Justice Surya Kant. Four farmers were run over when the Union Minister's convoy drove into a group of protesters at top speed - a moment captured in multiple unverified videos that have gone viral. Four others -- a journalist, two BJP worker and a driver -- were also killed in violence. The police have registered a case against 13 people. Amid calls for his sacking, Union Minister Ajay Mishra has ruled out resigning. While Mr Mishra has admitted the car that ran over protesters was his, both he and his son have denied that they were present during the incident.   Mr Mishra was the chief guest at a meeting of prison officials today. The Border Security Force, a paramilitary force under his ministry, was deployed to keep the media out. The petitioner told NDTV: ""I decided to write to the Chief Justice as a conscious citizen of a democratic country. If one can't get justice even in a democracy, then where else will justice happen? I was disturbed by the videos of the farmers being mowed down, especially that old farmer."""

Mr Ambani's Reliance Retail Ltd. secured the pact just days after troubled supermarket operator Future Retail Ltd. terminated its own agreement with one of the world's biggest convenience chains. The first 7-Eleven store will open Saturday in a Mumbai suburb, and will be followed by a further ""rapid rollout"" starting across India's financial hub, Reliance Retail said in a statement Thursday, without providing financial details. Reliance scooped the transaction after indebted Future Retail this week said it ended the agreement it inked with 7-Eleven in 2019 by mutual consent after it was unable to open the brand's stores or pay franchisee fees. Mr Ambani is locked in a bitter court battle with Amazon.com Inc. for the assets of Future Retail, which is one of the biggest brick-and-mortar chains in India. The move is part of the powerful tycoon's wider ambition to seize India's growing formalized retail space. Reliance is expanding its foothold at a rapid rate, adding 1,500 new stores last year to a total of nearly 13,000, Mr Ambani said at a shareholders' meeting in June. The shares of Mr Ambani's flagship Reliance Industries rose as much as 1.6% Thursday. 'Ideal Time' ""India is the second-largest country in the world and has one of the fastest-growing economies,"" 7-Eleven's President and Chief Executive Officer Joe DePinto said in the statement. ""It's an ideal time for the largest convenience retailer in the world to make our entry into India."" 7-Eleven's entry also comes at a fortuitous moment as India enjoys a relative lull of Covid-19 infections after a devastating wave battered the country just months ago. Daily cases are now hovering near a 7-month low and lockdown restrictions have largely been lifted across the country as India's vaccination drive gains momentum. Many foreign firms have long coveted access to India's market of about 1.4 billion people in a country where discretionary spending in on the rise. However, they have faced considerable hurdles to entry and political opposition given the ubiquity of the kirana store, small-scale mom-and-pop shops that account for about three-quarters of India's retail landscape. ""To make a dent, Reliance will need to have similar penetration over time,"" said Utkarsh Sinha, managing director of Mumbai-based Bexley Advisors Ltd. ""One tailwind in their favor is going to be the market's affinity for brands: as long as they are able to build it up, they can cause a shift in shopping behavior."" Changing Landscape The deal between the two companies is a ""good fit"" that can harness Reliance's digital reach and gives Mr Ambani a ""last-mile linkage to the consumer,"" according to Saloni Nangia, president at retail consultancy Technopak Advisors Pvt. ""The landscape is changing with kiranas also becoming digitally assisted and that's going to be the largest growing segment in India,"" she added. Mr Ambani's tie-up with 7-Eleven is also another sign of the increasing stranglehold a handful of dominant Indian conglomerates are exerting on India's retail space, as they increasingly act as a gateway to major foreign investment.   Many global companies, from Facebook Inc. to Starbucks Corp. have gained entry to the country's massive market in recent years via deals with sprawling Indian players, including Reliance and Tata Group, which have also aggressively acquired home-grown startups. ""The larger business groups who are well funded are taking a larger share,"" Ms Nangia said. ""It is getting consolidated between four and five players -- Reliance has the largest share."""

Heart disease and stroke are already the leading causes of death worldwide. The increased likelihood of lethal heart complications in Covid survivors -- who number in the hundreds of millions globally -- will add to its devastation, according to the study, which is under consideration for publication by a Nature journal. ""The aftereffects of Covid-19 are substantial,"" said Ziyad Al-Aly, director of the clinical epidemiology center at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System in Missouri, who led the research. ""Governments and health systems must wake up to the reality that Covid will cast a tall shadow in the form of long Covid, and has devastating consequences. I am concerned that we are not taking this seriously enough."" The chances of a heart attack, stroke, or other major cardiovascular event in the first 12 months of Covid recovery increase with the severity of the initial illness, the researchers found. They compared the risks of heart complications in 151,195 veterans who survived Covid to the risk in more than 3.6 million of their peers who didn't contract the pandemic disease. The data were collected from the largest integrated health-care system in the U.S. Most of its users are are white and male, which may limit how generalizable the study's findings are to other groups, the authors said. They found non-hospitalized Covid patients had a 39% increased risk of developing heart failure and a 2.2-fold increased risk of a potentially deadly blood clot, known as a pulmonary embolism, in the following year, compared with someone who didn't develop the disease. That works out to an extra 5.8 cases of heart-failure and 2.8 cases of pulmonary embolism for every 1,000 Covid patients who were never hospitalized. Intensive Care Being hospitalized for Covid is associated with a 5.8-fold increased risk of cardiac arrest and almost a 14-fold greater chance of myocarditis, or inflammation or the heart muscle, the study found. Covid patients who needed intensive care are at significantly greater risk, with almost one in seven suffering a major adverse cardiac event that they wouldn't have otherwise had within a year.   Researchers are still trying to unravel the causes of heart damage in Covid patients. Possible mechanisms include lingering damage from direct viral invasion of heart-muscle cells and the cells that line blood vessels, blood clots and aberrant and persistent inflammation, the authors said. The findings from natural disasters and previous pandemics suggest indirect effects of Covid-19, including social isolation, financial distress, changes in dietary habits and physical activity, as well as trauma and grief, may also influence the risks for cardiovascular disease, they said."

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackarey along with his wife Rashmi Thackeray and two sons Aaditya and Tejas visited the Mumba Devi temple in Mumbai around 8:45 am and offered prayer to the Goddess, as the reopening of religious places coincided with the beginning of the nine-day Navratri festival. Since early morning, devotees were seen visiting various temples in the state capital Mumbai while adhering to the mask and social distancing norms. Mosques in the city also witnessed a steady stream of the faithful since morning. The Chief Minister and his family members, all wearing masks and following the social distancing rule, were there in the Mumba Devi temple premises for about half-an-hour. Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar was also present there along with the Chief Minister. After offering prayers, the Chief Minister extended greetings to citizens on the occasion of the Navratri festival. ""It is the responsibility of all to observe health protocols at the places of worship in view of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said. The Chief Minister said he prayed to Goddess Mumba Devi to eradicate the coronavirus completely. He said the trustees and priests of all places of worship should ensure that devotees follow discipline while offering prayers, and the shrine premises are cleaned and sanitised frequently and proper social distancing is followed. ""We can set an example in this regard,"" he said. He also praised places of worship like the famous Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai for using QR code and other technologies to facilitate online darshan for devotees. After the first coronavirus wave waned, places of religious worship were reopened in Maharashtra in November last year, but they were closed again for people after the second wave started in the state in March 2021. For long, the opposition BJP had been demanding reopening of temples and other places of worship in Maharashtra. The party staged protests in August in several cities of Maharashtra in support of its demand. The Maharashtra government last month announced reopening of all religious places from October 7 in the state with COVID-19 protocols, a move that comes amid indication that the second wave of the pandemic is ebbing. Besides Mumbai, religious places in other parts of the state also reopened on Thursday.
In neighbouring Thane city, BJP MLC Niranjan Davkhare visited the famous Ghantali Devi temple and offered prayers to the Goddess. A number of devotees, mostly women, dressed in traditional attire, were seen visiting the temple. The Kopineshwar temple in the main market area of Thane city and the Lord Shiva temple in Ambernath town also reopened their doors for devotees early in the morning. The temple managements provided sanitisers to visitors and ensured that social distancing was followed. In adjoining Palghar district, the reopening of the Mahalaxmi temple at Dahanu and the Vajreshwari temple in Vasai were marked by musical performances arranged by temple managements. Flower vendors and those selling other items for prayers expressed happiness at the reopening of religious places. Sapna Mali, whose family earned a living by selling flowers outside a Ganesh temple in Thane city, said, ""It is good that the temples have reopened, otherwise it would have been difficult for us to survive in these times."" Last month, while announcing the reopening of religious places, Chief Minister Thackeray had urged people not to drop guard and continue COVID-19-appropriate behaviour in view of a possible third wave of the pandemic. The government had issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) for devotees and officials managing places of worship to ensure strict implement of coronavirus-related protocols and curb spread of the infection. These strict measures include non-distribution of 'prasad' (offerings), no sprinkling of holy water, no touching of statues, idols or holy books and staggering the number of visitors to maintain social distancing, a government order earlier said. Face mask or covering of the face is mandatory while visiting religious places, it said, adding the minimum distance between two persons should be six feet. The state government advised senior citizens, pregnant women and children below 10 years of age to remain at home. The management of shrines should provide separate entry and exit points for devotees, if possible, to avoid crowding, said the order. People should avoid physical contact while greeting each other, it added.

The media, earlier invited to cover the event, was not allowed in. The invitation was withdrawn over concerns reporters could press Mr Mishra on the delayed arrest of his son. Ashish Mishra has been accused of murder and negligence in a FIR filed by UP Police. However, the authorities have yet to arrest or question him. Yesterday UP Police's Additional Director-General, Prashant Kumar, told NDTV ""no one will be spared... Technical evidence is permanent. It cannot be influenced."" On Tuesday a top state police official told NDTV the delay was because the force is ""busy with negotiations with farmers and then with postmortems and then with getting the cremations done"". Asked if the delay could be linked to the accused's obvious connections, SN Sabat (ADGP, Lucknow Zone) said: ""Attitude of the police is towards the victim and not the accused."" Ajay Mishra, who is the junior Home Minister and oversees law and order, and policing issues, for the country, has also remained defiant in the face of calls for his resignation. He met his boss, Home Minister Amit Shah, yesterday, after which government sources ruled out any chance of him quitting. Speaking to NDTV earlier, he denied pressure to step down and asked: ""Why would I [resign]? There is no pressure on us, We will investigate this..."" The opposition is firm in its demand Mr Mishra resign so as to ensure an ""unbiased investigation"". ""Justice is a right in a democracy... The Union Minister needs to resign to ensure an unbiased investigation..."" Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said yesterday after meeting the families of those killed. Ms Gandhi Vadra, who was arrested (without a legal notice, she alleged) for two days while trying to visit the families, also questioned how she could be detained but a murder accused remain free. Both Ajay Mishra and Ashish Mishra have denied all charges, and said they were not at the scene of the horrific incident, which saw a SUV at high speed ram into farmers holding a peaceful protest. Mr Mishra told NDTV that the car belonged to his family but neither he nor his son were present. Ashish Mishra told NDTV: ""I was not in the car... was at my paternal home in Banwirpur where a wrestling match was being organised. I was there from the morning till the end of the event"".   Eight people, including four farmers, died at Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday as violence erupted ahead of a visit by Mr Mishra and UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. The other four were people in the cars; they were part of a convoy of BJP workers who had come to welcome Mr Maurya and were attacked after allegedly running over the protesting farmers."

The party has fielded Himmat Singh Jhala from Vallabhnagar (Udaipur) and Khet Singh Meena from Dhariawad (Pratapgarh) assembly seats. The by-elections have been necessitated due to the deaths of BJP MLA from Dhariawad, Gautam Lal Meena, and Congress MLA from Vallabhnagar, Gajendra Singh Shaktawat. Instead of giving ticket to the family member of Gautam Lal Meena, the BJP has fielded another leader Khet Singh Meena on the seat. Khet Singh Meena has the backing of the RSS, according to party sources. In Vallabhnagar, the party has fielded local Rajput candidate Himmat Singh Jhala who has influence on the community. The Congress is yet to announce the name of its candidates. The last date of nomination filing is October 8.   Polling will take place on October 30 and counting of votes will be held on November 2.

Mr Khurshid also remarked that the Samajwadi Party (SP) Chief Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) Chief Mayawati should have had joined forces with Priyanka Gandhi on the Lakhimpuri incident since their views on the events are also similar to that of Priyanka Gandhi. Drawing comparisons between the Lakhimpuri incident and Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, he said, ""Though such historical events must be kept aside, the brutality witnessed during the Lakhimpuri incident is similar to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre."" Mr Khurshid said that Union Minister Ajay Mishra Teni should resign and his son should also get arrested. Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of several farmer unions, alleged that Ashish Mishra Teni, son of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra Teni arrived with three vehicles around the time that farmers were dispersing from their protest at the helipad and mowed down farmers and towards the end also attacked SKM leader Tajinder Singh Virk directly, by trying to run a vehicle over him. However, Ashish Mishra refuted SKM's allegations and said he was not present at the spot where the incident took place.   As many as eight people died in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident on Sunday, said Uttar Pradesh police. MoS Teni also said that his son was not present at the spot, adding that some people mingled with protesting farmers and pelted the stones at the car which lead to the 'unfortunate incident'."

Mr Malik, who is also a cabinet minister in the state government, tweeted a video of KP Gosavi (the PI) and Manish Bhanushali (the BJP office-bearer) exiting a white car late on the night of the raid and walking into the central drug agency's Mumbai office. ""Here is the video of Kiran P Gosavi and Manish Bhanushali entering the NCB office the same night the cruise ship was raided,"" Mr Malik wrote in his post. Mr Malik also called out what he saw as a discrepancy in statements by senior NCB officer Sameer Wankhede, and alleged the agency wanted to ""frame two more people"". ""Sameer Wankhede's statement where he said eight to 10 people have been arrested... while eight were arrested. Why was he not sure? Did they have an intention to frame two more?"" he tweeted. Yesterday Mr Malik held a press conference to accuse the BJP of ""maligning Maharashtra"". He also alleged the BJP had framed Aryan Khan to attack his father, Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan. ""For the last month, information was being circulated to crime reporters that the next target is actor Shah Rukh Khan,"" he said. Aryan Khan was one of eight people arrested after the NCB's raid on the cruise ship, but no drugs have been recovered from his possession. Mr Malik, whose NCP is part of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state, has demanded to know how outsiders were allowed access to the NCB's operation. ""They have locked profiles of Manish Bhanushali and Gosavi... How is he (Manish Bhanushali) present at an NCB raid? BJP is using NCB to malign Maharashtra,"" he declared. Bhanushali has refuted the allegations but has accepted he was, in fact, the person seen escorting Arbaz Merchant (another of those arrested) into NCB custody, as claimed by Mr Malik. However, Bhanushali said he holds no official position within the BJP and that he was at the raid for ""updated information"", after having provided tips about drugs on the cruise. Mr Malik also claimed the man seen in a viral video with Aryan Khan is Kiran Gosavi, a PI, who could be seen leading Shah Rukh Khan's son into the NCB office on Sunday. The anti-drugs agency has named both men as ""independent witnesses"" to the raids. Addressing the allegations, NCB Deputy Director-General Gyaneshwar Singh yesterday said the agency had conducted itself as per the laws, and countered the claims with some of his own.   ""Some allegations... seem to have been made with malice and probable prejudice... in retaliation against earlier legal action (a reference to investigations into alleged drug use in Bollywood following the death of actor Sushant Rajput in June last year),"" he said. Eight persons were detained by the NCB in connection with Sunday's raid on the cruise ship. All eight were arrested the day after and sent to the agency's custody, which expires today."

After almost two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the doors of temples have been opened for devotees to worship and pay obeisance. However, to ensure that the festival does not contribute to the spread of infection, the temple boards have taken special care to ensure social distancing. An eager crowd of devotees at Varanasi started visiting the Durga temple at Durga Kund from 4 am today. They, while following the Covid protocol, waited in queues for their chance to pray. Similarly, devotees queued outside Kanpur's Vaibhav Laxmi Devi temple and Gorakhpur's Kali Temple. The devotees expressed their reverence by offering coconut, flowers and fruits to the Goddess. Prayers for the welfare of humankind, especially during the tough times of the COVID-19 pandemic, were offered at temples in Varanasi. The priest at the temple said that people are so happy to come back to temples after the pandemic. Adding to it, a devotee said, ""Last year, we weren't able to visit the temple due to the pandemic. We are thankful that it has been possible for us to come here today."" ""I am delighted to visit the temple again after two years. Even if the government has relaxed the guidelines for the festival, it is necessary that we take conscious steps to follow Covid protocols and to ensure that we do not contribute to the further spread of the infection,"" a devotee at Kali temple said. The celebrations of Navratri involve worshipping Goddess Durga and her nine forms. The festival is celebrated in different ways across the country. Over the next nine days, devotees offer their prayers to Goddess Durga and observe fasts. Also known as Sharad (autumn) Navratri, the occasion is believed to mark Goddess Durga's victory over demon Mahishasura, signifying the victory of good over evil.   The 10th day of Sharad Navratri is celebrated as Dussehra or Vijaya Dashami. The festival of Navratri will be observed from October 7 till October 15.

""The video is crystal clear. Protestors cannot be silenced through murder. There has to be accountability for the innocent blood of farmers that has been spilled and justice must be delivered before a message of arrogance and cruelty enters the minds of every farmer,"" he wrote. A member of the ruling BJP, Mr Gandhi has been fiercely critical of what happened at Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday, during which eight people, including four farmers, were killed. On Tuesday he shared a grainier version of the above video and wrote: ""This video will shake anyone's soul"". Mr Gandhi demanded UP Police take notice and make ""immediate arrests"".  ""In Lakhimpur, the video that shows cars running over farmers will shake anyone's soul. Police should take note of this video and identify the owners of the car, those sitting in the car and others involved to make immediate arrests,"" the Lok Sabha MP from UP's Pilibhit tweeted in Hindi. The day before that Mr Gandhi condemned those involved in the death of farmers and urged the government to be patient and restrained in its approach. He also wrote to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to ask for a CBI probe and ₹ 1 crore compensation for the dead farmers' families. The newer video of the incident - which emerged yesterday - seems to contest claims by Mr Ajay Mishra and his son Ashish that their SUV - a Mahindra Thar - was under attack by the farmers. The video - which NDTV has not been able to verify - shows no stones or sticks being thrown - and that the car drove, seemingly deliberately, into protesters who had their backs to the vehicle. Four farmers died as a result of the vehicle ramming into the group of protesters. According to witnesses, it was after this an enraged mob attacked the cars and set them on fire. Four people in the convoy of cars were beaten to death. The farmers had gathered at Lakhimpur Kheri to protest the visit of Mr Mishra, who is the junior Union Home Minister, and UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. Farmer groups have claimed Ashish Mishra was travelling in one of the cars in the convoy. Both he and his father have denied this charge. Mr Mishra told NDTV that although the SUV belonged to his family, neither he nor his son were in it when the incident took place. A murder case has been filed against Ashish Mishra but no arrests have been made as yet. There have also been demands for Ajay Mishra to resign. Mr Mishra met his boss, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, yesterday, after which government sources ruled out any resignation. Farmers across the country have been protesting the government's new farm laws - which they say will rob them of MSPs and leave them exposed to hostile corporate interests - for over a year. The government has insisted the laws will be beneficial and has refused to roll them back.   Multiple rounds of talks have, so far, failed to break the deadlock. With input from PTI"

Biden's opponents and several lawmakers have slammed Garcetti, who is now awaiting confirmation hearing, for this. “Disgraced LA mayor Eric Garcetti, who Joe Biden nominated for Ambassador to India, was one of the many ambitious potential buyers at Hunter Biden's art show where pieces are selling for USD 500k,” Congressman Jim Banks said in a tweet. “I'm sure it is just a coincidence...,” he said. According to Mother Jones, about 200 people attended this event. “Hunter's gallerist, Georges Bergès, has said he's expecting as much as USD 500,000 for some of the paintings,” The Atlantic reported. “Unfortunately for the White House, the people about to profit from Hunter's foray into the art world are anticipating far higher returns—and suddenly presenting the Biden administration with a new Hunter-related headache,” the news outlet said. The White House refused to answer questions on this. “We've spoken to the arrangement that is run by the gallerist and Hunter Biden's representatives that the White House provided suggestions for. I'd refer you to the gallerists for questions about the event and as well as the representatives of Mr. Garcetti in terms of his attendance,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference when asked about it. “The ambassador-designate to India was seen reportedly at an event in Los Angeles last week, an art gallery event that featured the artwork of the president's son, Hunter. The ethicists who have pointed to this arrangement have expressed concern that the president's son selling art could potentially put the president in a situation where those who seek jobs, either in this administration or favors from this administration, could put this White House in an awkward position,” a reporter asked.   “What is the White House's response to the fact that an ambassador nominee was at this event? And secondly, should we expect to see more people who seek jobs in this administration attending events like this,” the reporters asked during the news conference.

The court has decided to take up the case amid a growing outcry over the Uttar Pradesh police's handling of the investigation, media reports and a letter written to the Chief Justice by two lawyers from the state. The letter had called for a CBI probe under the supervision of the Supreme Court. Farmers have vowed to intensify their months-long movement against laws aimed at liberalising agriculture as tension flared after the eight people were killed in clashes between protesters and ruling party supporters on Sunday. Four of the eight were killed when a car belonging to Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra's son Ashish crashed into protesters in Uttar Pradesh state, protest leaders said. And yet four days later, despite being named in a police complaint, he was yet to be arrested. The police have said they were investigating the crash and had registered a case against 13 people, including Ashish Mishra even as his father ruled out resigning and held a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi. Mr Mishra said his son was not present at the incident but a car driven by ""our driver"" lost control and hit the farmers after they threw stones at the car and attacked it with sticks and sword. Ashish Mishra has also denied being present and remains at large. An alliance of protest groups called in a petition to President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday for a court-supervised investigation of the violence. The legislation the farmers object to, introduced in September last year, deregulates the sector, allowing farmers to sell produce to buyers beyond government-regulated wholesale markets, where growers are assured of a minimum price. Small farmers say the changes make them vulnerable to competition from big business, and that they could eventually lose price supports for staples such as wheat and rice.   The government says reform of the sector, which accounts for about 15 per cent of the $2.7 trillion economy, mean new opportunities and better prices for farmers. India's longest-running farm protests pose a risk for the re-election prospects of the BJP when Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, goes to the polls early next year."

Protective antibodies decreased continuously during the six months after the administration of the second dose of the vaccine, according to a study of about 5,000 Israeli health workers, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The levels fell first at a sharp pace and later at a more moderate one. Researchers worldwide are trying to identify the critical threshold of antibodies needed to prevent coronavirus infection, severe illness and death, said Gili Regev-Yochay, one of the authors of the study. Such studies will help assess risk levels for various groups and the measures needed to protect them, the researcher said. Antibody levels were found to be lower in older people than in younger, and in immunosuppressed individuals compared to the healthy population, according to the study from Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan. Men's antibody counts were lower than those of women both at their peak and at the end of the study. The research shows why there are breakthrough infections in individuals who have had two vaccine doses, Regev-Yochay said in an online press briefing. The U.S., which has restricted its booster recommendation to older people and other vulnerable groups, will likely follow Israel's decision to offer a third dose to the entire population, she said. ""I would be more than surprised if we are not going to start to see a lot of breakthrough infections in the United States,"" among those who have received just two doses, Regev-Yochay said. The Israel findings were bolstered by a second real-world study from Qatar, published in the same journal, that found the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot faded over a similar time period. Protection fell from 77.5% during the first month after the second dose to 20% in months five to seven after the second dose. Still, the research found, prevention of severe and fatal infections remained strong throughout the study period, reaching 96% in the first two months after the second dose and persisting at roughly this level for six months. Consistent Data ""The data is consistent,"" said Laith Abu-Raddad, a coauthor of the paper who studies infectious disease epidemiology at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar. ""Protection against hospitalization and death is really strong and more durable than protection against infection."" Giving a third booster shot helps optimize the protection from the vaccine, he said.   Two other studies from Israel published in the journal also followed up on early reports of heart inflammation following vaccination. Cases of inflammation, called myocarditis, although rare, increased after the receipt of the vaccine, according to one study by the Israeli Health Ministry and Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, particularly after the second dose among young male recipients. While cases were usually mild, one was fatal. Another study by the Clalit Health Services, the largest health-care system in the country, found that the estimated incidence of myocarditis was 2.13 cases per 100,000 persons. The highest incidence was among male patients between the ages of 16 and 29. Most of the cases were mild or moderate."

Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi, one of few women of color to ever run a large public U.S. company, said she's never asked for a raise and once turned one down during the financial crisis.  ""I've never, ever, ever asked for a raise,"" Nooyi said in an interview with the New York Times Magazine this week. ""I find it cringeworthy. I cannot imagine working for somebody and saying my pay is not enough."" Only 31 women run companies in the S&P 500, and that number was even smaller when Nooyi stepped down in 2018. The ones who do tend to make less. In her final year on the job, Nooyi didn't rank close to the top for executive pay at public companies in the U.S. - most women didn't. That year, Oracle Corp.'s Safra Catz was the highest-paid female CEO on Bloomberg's ranking of executive compensation, coming in at 33rd on the list.  ""I never asked my board to give me more money,"" Nooyi said in the New York Times interview. ""In fact, one year the board gave me a raise and I said, 'I don't want it.' They said, 'Why not?' It was right after a financial crisis, and I said, 'I don't want the raise.'"" In the early aughts, when Nooyi was still at Pepsi, a body of research suggested that women didn't negotiate their salaries as frequently as men, a potential contributor to the gender pay gap. Sheryl Sandberg's ""Lean In"" famously told women to just ask and they'd receive. Since then, research from McKinsey & Co. and LeanIn.org found women were engaging in the process just as much as men. But, there was a catch: They were less likely to get them, which might explain their initial reticence.  Nooyi now sits on Amazon.com Inc.'s board and recently published a memoir called ""My Life in Full."" Since her tenure at Pepsi, CEO pay packages have only grown and last year only five of the country's 100 top-paid executives were women.   --With assistance from Jeff Green.

Paris recalled its envoy on September 17, enraged at Australia's decision to tear up a landmark defence contract worth about US$65 billion in favour of a US offer. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told parliament the ambassador would now return to Canberra with ""two objectives"". He said envoy Jean-Pierre Thebault would ""define our relationship with Australia in the future"" and ""firmly defend our interests"" as the two sides negotiate a settlement. Since the contracts for the 12 French attack submarines had already been signed, the severance deal could cost Australia hundreds of millions of dollars. The ambassador's planned return was welcomed by Australia's government. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he hoped the allies could now ""move beyond our recent disappointments"". ""Obviously the two countries, France and Australia, share a number of common interests, particularly in our work together in the region. So, let's hope we can get that relationship back on track,"" he told Channel 9 television. French President Emmanuel Macron reacted furiously to Australia's announcement on September 15 that it had secretly lined up a new, nuclear-powered submarine deal with the United States and Britain. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian accused Australia of back-stabbing and the United States of betrayal, calling the move reminiscent of the unilateralist attitude of former president Donald Trump. Paris recalled its envoys to both Australia and the United States over the furore. But Macron later ordered the ambassador to Washington to return to his post after a call with US President Joe Biden, which helped soothe tensions. France, however, made clear it was not in a rush to mend fences with Australia, and kept its envoy to Canberra in Paris.   France's anger stemmed not only from the financial loss of the submarine deal but also the shattering of an alliance with Australia that it saw as a cornerstone of its Indo-Pacific security strategy.

Federal employees will be required to declare their full vaccination status through an online portal by Oct. 29. Workers and passengers age 12 and older on trains, planes and marine transport operating domestically - which are federally regulated - must show they have been inoculated by Oct. 30. ""These travel measures, along with mandatory vaccination for federal employees, are some of the strongest in the world,"" Trudeau told reporters. ""If you've done the right thing and gotten vaccinated, you deserve the freedom to be safe from COVID."" There are almost 300,000 federal service workers, plus 955,000 federally regulated workers, representing about 8% of Canada's full-time workforce, according to the Treasury Board, which manages the public service. The government's new vaccine mandates were a cornerstone pledge by Trudeau during his campaign for re-election last month. The Liberals returned to power in a closely contested election, but fell short of winning a majority. Canada has fully vaccinated more that 80% of its eligible population ages 12 and over. Canada's neighbor to the south, the United States, said last month most federal employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 no later than Nov. 22, while federal contractors must be vaccinated by Dec. 8. The U.S. government also is drafting rules to require large employers to have their workers inoculated or tested weekly. Some other countries also have pursued vaccine mandates for government employees. Fiji  in August forced public workers to go on leave if unvaccinated. If still not inoculated by November, they would lose their jobs. Later this month, Italy will require proof of vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery from infection for all the country's workers. During his re-election bid, Trudeau often faced anti-vaccine protesters, one of whom hurled a handful of gravel at him at a campaign event last month. His main opponent, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole, opposed vaccine mandates. The mandate for federal employees is likely to be challenged in court, said Daniel Lublin, a Toronto-based employment lawyer. ""There will be claims,"" Lublin said, noting that unpaid leave could be challenged as effective termination or unjust dismissal. CONCERNS ON IMPLEMENTATION The Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), which represents 215,000 federal workers including 8,500 border guards, said that while the union supports the government's vaccination stance, the policy was set out without proper consultation. The union was given a draft only late on Friday, said Chris Aylward, PSAC president. ""The way that this policy was announced leaves us basically with our hands up in the air saying, how is this going to be implemented?"" Aylward said in a phone interview. ""This was simply an opportunity for the prime minister... to tick off an election promise."" The National Airlines Council of Canada, which represents the country's major air carriers, said it welcomed the rules but ""urgently"" needed to engage with officials about implementation. Members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are among those who must be vaccinated, and the government has asked the head of the armed forces staff to require inoculations. A spokesman for the National Police Federation, which represents the nearly 20,000 RCMP employees, had no immediate comment. Canada's vaccine mandate for federal workers, first promised on Aug. 13, will be reassessed every six months and stay in place until the policy is no longer required, one official said. For travelers, a negative COVID-19 test will not be accepted as a replacement for proof of vaccination after Nov. 30, officials said. Children under 12 who are not eligible for vaccination will be exempted from the travel mandate.   The government also said it is working with industry to put a strict vaccine requirement in place for cruise ships before the resumption of the 2022 cruise season.

By-elections for 84 vacant seats across 6 Zilla Parishads (ZPs) - Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim, Nagpur, Palghar and also 141 seats in 37 Panchayat Samitis falling under the jurisdiction of these districts were held on Tuesday and the votes were counted on Wednesday. Candidates in one ZP seat (total 85) and three Panchayat Samiti wards (total 144) were elected unopposed. Of the 85 seats on offer in six ZPs, the BJP won the highest 22, while the Congress, the NCP and the Shiv Sena - all constituents of the ruling MVA - bagged 19, 15 and 12 seats, respectively, (total 46). Independents secured four seats, the CPI (M) one and others won 12 seats, the SEC said. In Panchayat Samiti bypolls, the Congress won the highest 36 of the 144 seats on offer followed by the BJP 33, the Shiv Sena 23 and the NCP 18 seats, the SEC results showed. Independent candidates won seven, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena one and other registered parties bagged 26 Panchayat Samiti seats. The MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi) allies won 73 of the 144 Panchayat Samiti seats. As many as 367 candidates were in the fray for the ZP seats and 555 contestants for the Panchayat Samiti seats in the bypolls where the voter turnout was around 63 per cent. The by-elections were necessitated following a Supreme Court ruling on quota for OBCs in local bodies. Maharashtra PWD minister Ashok Chavan of the Congress said the BJP has suffered a ""major blow"" in the ZP and Panchayat Samiti by-elections due to its ""double standards"" on Maratha reservation (in jobs and education) and political quota for OBCs (other backward classes). ""Whether it is Maratha reservation or OBC's political reservation, the BJP has adopted double standards every time. The BJP did not take right decisions when its government at the Centre had the opportunity to play a decisive role in maintaining both these reservations,"" Mr Chavan said. The minister, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha quota, said out of the 85 vacant seats in ZPs, the Congress had 13 members earlier, but it now has won 17 seats. The Maha Vikas Aghadi allies won 46 ZP seats this time, as compared to 37 earlier, despite contesting the bypolls separately, he said. Mr Chavan said on the other side, the BJP's seat count dropped to 22 from 31 earlier, while the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi's tally fell to eight from 12. BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said bypoll results show who is growing at the cost of the Shiv Sena and how the Uddhav Thackeray-led party's base is going further down. The former Chief Minister claimed the BJP is growing steadily in the state. The Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly said, ""The BJP's base is steadily increasing and the base of others is declining. The Shiv Sena is going further down."" Mr Fadnavis thanked voters for making the BJP, the ""No. 1 party"" in these Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti by-elections. The BJP has won 25 per cent of the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti seats and Independents and smaller parties, too, have won 25 per cent of the seats. The remaining 50 per cent includes the three MVA parties, he CM said. State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said in these by-elections, the ruling MVA allies made full use of their power, but voters gave first preference to his party. ""While in power in the state from 2014 to 2019, the BJP was the number one party in local body elections and despite being in the opposition now, the same trend continues,"" Mr Patil said. He said in the 2019 assembly elections, the BJP won an absolute majority by forming an alliance (with the Shiv Sena). Despite that it has to sit in the opposition (after the Sena walked out of the saffron alliance), but the BJP still has the support of the people, the former minister said. Mr Patil expressed confidence that the BJP will win the upcoming assembly bypolls in Deglur in Nanded district. The Supreme Court in March this year had read down the OBC quota in local bodies. Following the SC order, the OBC seats in Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim, Nagpur and Palghar ZPs and Panchayat Samitis falling under them got converted to general category seats. As a result, seats in the 85 wards of these six ZPs and 144 wards in the Panchayat Samiti fell vacant. Candidate in one of these seats from Dhule ZP, nominees from two seats from Shirpur Panchayat Samiti in Dhule, and one from Akkalkuwa Panchayat Samiti were declared elected unopposed. Last month, the Maharashtra State Election Commission had declared byelections to six ZPs and the panchayat samitis under them for the seats that fell vacant after the SC order. The SEC had earlier declared that these bypolls will be held on July 19, but they were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.   On September 9, the Supreme Court ruled that COVID-19 restrictions were not applicable for bypolls and directed the Maharashtra SEC to announce fresh dates.

The court has decided to take up the case amid a growing outcry over the Uttar Pradesh police's handling of the investigation, media reports and a letter written to the Chief Justice by two lawyers from the state. The letter had called for a CBI probe under the supervision of the Supreme Court. Farmers have vowed to intensify their months-long movement against laws aimed at liberalising agriculture as tension flared after the eight people were killed in clashes between protesters and ruling party supporters on Sunday. Four of the eight were killed when a car belonging to Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra's son Ashish crashed into protesters in Uttar Pradesh state, protest leaders said. And yet four days later, despite being named in a police complaint, he was yet to be arrested. The police have said they were investigating the crash and had registered a case against 13 people, including Ashish Mishra even as his father ruled out resigning and held a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi. Mr Mishra said his son was not present at the incident but a car driven by ""our driver"" lost control and hit the farmers after they threw stones at the car and attacked it with sticks and sword.

Testifying before a powerful Congressional committee on Afghanistan, Gen (rtd) H R McMaster, said that the US needs to hold the Pakistan prime minister accountable for some of his comments after the fall of Kabul in August. It is also delusional, he said, to think that any of the money that would go to the Taliban or through the Taliban for humanitarian purposes would immediately be used by the Taliban to solidify their power and to become an even greater threat. ""So, we're in a situation where we're facing a really extraordinary dilemma that it's going to be tough for us to mitigate the humanitarian crisis without empowering the Taliban,"" he said in response to a question. ""I don't think we should give any assistance to Pakistan at all. I think Pakistan has had it both ways for way too long. I think Pakistan should be confronted with its behavior over the years that has actually resulted, I think, in large measure in this outcome,"" McMaster said. It was during the Trump Administration that the US had blocked all security assistance to Pakistan. The Biden Administration has not resumed the security aide yet. ""I think we ought to hold Imran Khan responsible for his comments when Kabul fell and he said that the Afghan people have been unshackled. Why should we send a dime to Pakistan under any conditions? I think that they should be confronted with international isolation because of their support for jihadist terrorists, who are threats to humanity, including Haqqani network, the Taliban, and groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba,"" he said. Responding to a question from Congressman Scott Perry, during the Congressional hearing convened by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, McMaster said that it is a good idea to remove Pakistan's status as a major non-NATO ally. ""I would say the only time I think we have ever laid out a very clear and realistic assessment of South Asia and prioritised the strategy was President Trump's speech in August of 2017. Now, he abandoned it and he doubled down on the flaws of the Obama administration. I don't know how that happened. But I think if you go back to that August 2017 speech, that was the proper approach to Pakistan as well, which called for a suspension of all assistance to Pakistan until Pakistan fundamentally changed its behaviour,"" McMaster said. Congressman Bill Keating said Pakistan remains a problem and the US needs to assess it. ""Its long standing activities, by many accounts, have been negative. I think that's putting it mildly. For decades, though, for decades, whether you go back to''96 when the Taliban took control, Pakistan was one of the first to recognise them,"" he said. ""When you go through the change in 2001 in Afghanistan and then the reconstruction of the Taliban starting around 2005, they were there giving assistance, by all accounts, and I believe those accounts are accurate. And indeed, right up into this current change in the government, Pakistan, there were many people that suggested their intelligence was embedded with them,"" Keating said. Pakistan's relationship with the Haqqani network is one that is of great concern. ""That may indeed affect our relations with India in that respect. But can you comment on that? I think they have been duplicitous, not just recently, not just in the few months of this administration, but for decades in this with many administrations, Republican and Democratic alike,"" he said. Former US Ambassador to Pakistan Ryan Croker acknowledged that Pakistan worked against the US in some very fundamental aspects with their support for the Taliban. ""Earlier, I tried to present their narrative as to why. We were going to walk out, and they did not want to be left with the Taliban as a mortal enemy. They may get that anyway. And as satisfying as it would be to a lot of us, myself included, to do something to punish Pakistan for this, I don't think we have the luxury. They are already worried over the repercussions inside their own country of the Taliban's so-called victory in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""Now, we can say, 'Yeah. Well, they deserve whatever they get''. But again, a blow-up in Kashmir is going to bring a regional war. So, I think reassessment is always good, but let's reassess with a clear eye on the dangers now that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has created throughout the region. We do not need a completely destabilized Pakistani state with nuclear weapons,"" Croker said. McMaster told the lawmakers that the Taliban was backed by ISI and that's why they recaptured Afghanistan. ""The Taliban's differential advantage was the backing by the ISI of other groups. But it was the unscrupulous units who are willing to terrorise. They didn't give up their differential advantage. And so, I don't think it's a mystery at all why they collapsed. And I think it should be unacceptable, to disparage the Afghans who did fight, and over 60,000 of them made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve the freedoms we're now seeing,"" he said. The Taliban, he said, went around to the Afghan units, and they said, ""Hey, here's how this is going to go."" With the backing of the Pakistani ISI, intertwined with the Haqqani network and Al-Qaida, what they did is they told those commanders, ""Hey, listen. You accommodate with us. We give you the signal, or we kill your family. How does that sound?"" he said.   And that's why the Afghan forces collapsed in addition to the withdrawal of US intelligence support, the withdrawal of our airpower, which was the Afghan forces differential advantage, McMaster said.

Nawab Malik, a senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, said private detective KP Gosavi is the man seen holding Aryan Khan's hand and leading him to the NCB office on Sunday. Mr Malik said Manish Bhanushali, a BJP Vice President, was also seen in visuals of the raids. This, he said, proved a BJP hand in ""maligning Maharashtra with a fake drug bust"". ""Our allegation is that for the last one year the BJP is maligning Maharashtra. They have locked the profiles of Manish Bhanushali and Gosavi. Who was Manish Bhanushali meeting in Delhi and Gujarat? How is he present at an NCB raid? BJP is using NCB to malign Maharashtra,"" Nawab Malik alleged. Refuting the allegations, Manish Bhanushali told news agency ANI, ""NCP leader Nawab Malik has put wrong allegations against me. BJP has nothing to do with it (the arrests). I received information on October 1 that a drugs party was to be held. I was with the NCB officers (at the ship) for more information."" The anti-drugs agency named both the men as ""independent witnesses"" to the raids. ""The allegations are baseless. NCB reiterates its procedure has been and continues to be legally and professionally transparent and unbiased,"" said NCB officer Gyaneshwar Singh. Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant, and six others were arrested on Monday. The unknown man's selfie with Aryan Khan, when he appeared to be alone and without legal counsel, first confirmed to the world that the superstar's son had been detained. The anti-drugs agency, after denying that the smiling selfie-taker was one its men, has now called Gosavi a ""panchnama witness"" or independent witness to the raids. In several videos, Mr Bhanushali is seen holding the hand of Arbaaz Merchant as the convoy led by zonal NCB director Sameer Wankhede made its way to the anti-drugs office from the cruise ship after several people were detained Saturday night on allegations of consuming drugs. The BJP avoided questions on Mr Bhanushali's role and accused the Maharashtra government of politics. ""There will be many issues to do politics on but we should not do politics on drugs issue which concerns the future generations of our country,"" said Ram Kadam, BJP spokesperson. After raids on Saturday night on a cruise ship rave party, anti-drugs officers said they had seized 13 grams of cocaine, five grams of MD, 21 grams of charas, and 22 pills of Ecstasy, and ₹ 1.33 lakh.

Ghani has said he left Kabul to prevent bloodshed and denied reports he took large sums of money with him. But speculation has persisted, and Congress asked Sopko's team to get to the bottom of it. ""We haven't proven that yet. We're looking into that. Actually, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has asked us to look into that,"" Sopko told a House of Representatives subcommittee. Ghani has been bitterly criticized for fleeing as the Islamist Taliban reached the outskirts of Kabul in August. Sopko's Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) has long been investigating fraud, waste and abuse during America's massive state-building effort, which came to an ignoble end after 20 years with the Taliban takeover. Sopko suggested to the House Foreign Affairs Committee subcommittee that oversees development aid that the failure of the U.S. project shouldn't have been a surprise, given rampant corruption and mismanagement. ""Corruption grew so pervasive that it ultimately threatened the security and reconstruction mission in Afghanistan,"" he told the House panel. The congressional hearing was one of a series looking at the chaotic U.S. withdrawal and the path forward. ""We can apply the lessons learned in other conflict zones,"" Representative Joaquin Castro, the subcommittee's Democratic chairman, said. The United States and other countries have cut off almost all aid to Afghanistan. ""These are trying times for all of us who care about the future of the Afghan people, especially the Afghans that aided the U.S. and its allies over the past 20 years,"" Sopko said.   He said all of SIGAR's staff - including locally employed Afghan staff - were safely evacuated from Kabul.

Congress's Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met the family on Wednesday, along with other families who lost their loved ones in the horrific episode. Ashish Misra has been accused of murder and negligence in the First Information Report filed by the police. But the police are yet to arrest or question him.

Arlington assistant police chief Kevin Kolbye said a suspect, identified as Timothy George Simpkins, had been arrested after the shooting at Timberview High School in Arlington, a suburb of Dallas. Kolbye said Simpkins, who turned himself in after fleeing the school, would be charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Police said a .45 caliber gun had been recovered. ""This is not a random act of violence,"" Kolbye told reporters. ""A student got into a fight and drew a weapon."" Three people were hospitalized, two of them with gunshot wounds, the police officer said.

""We know that this is a traumatic incident for these kids,"" he said. ""We've increased security with additional police officers at all of our schools in Arlington."" The school was locked down following the shooting and Arlington police set up a secure area for parents to reunite with their children. Television images showed a heavy police presence around the school after the shooting, with armed officers searching the sprawling campus and ambulances and fire trucks on the scene. A fleet of yellow school buses was mobilized to evacuate students from the school after the lockdown was lifted. Timberview High School has an enrollment of around 1,900 students. After a year spent largely learning online, US schools have returned to the classroom, reviving the fear of on-campus shootings, with multiple small-scale incidents reported in recent weeks. More than 256,000 students have been exposed to gun violence in US schools since 13 people were killed in the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, according to data compiled by The Washington Post. The figure includes those caught up in the violence, such as witnesses, and those forced to evacuate educational institutions when gunfire erupted. According to a Post database, there were 29 school shootings in the United States in 2018 and 27 in 2019. The Post figures do not include shootings at colleges or universities, suicides or accidental discharges.   The deadliest recent school shooting in the United States took place in 2018, when 17 people were killed by a former student at a high school in Parkland, Florida.

133,Thu Oct 07 01:38:22 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: US Judge Temporarily Blocks Controversial Texas Anti-Abortion Law https://t.co/wlHf9bY7hE https://t.co/TZPgJ2xQyq,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-controversial-texas-anti-abortion-law-2566540,US Judge Temporarily Blocks Controversial Texas Anti-Abortion Law,"A US federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked a controversial law that bans most abortions in the state of Texas as part of a conservative drive to deny access to the procedure. The statute, which went into force on September 1, prohibits abortions as soon as a heartbeat is detectable, usually at around six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even know they are pregnant. There are no exceptions for cases of incest or rape. US District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin granted the request from President Joe Biden's administration to block enforcement of the law pending further litigation. Texas can appeal. In his 113-page ruling, Pitman said Texas officials had created an ""unprecedented and aggressive scheme to deprive its citizens of a significant and well-established constitutional right."" ""From the moment SB 8 went into effect, women have been unlawfully prevented from exercising control over their lives in ways that are protected by the Constitution,"" Pitman said, using the abbreviation for Senate Bill 8, the law's official name. ""This Court will not sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right."" Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood, hailed the ruling, calling it ""overdue."" ""While this fight is far from over, we are hopeful that the court's order blocking SB 8 will allow Texas abortion providers to resume services as soon as possible,"" she said In recent years, similar laws have been passed in other states but were struck down because they violated US Supreme Court precedent from Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that guaranteed a woman's right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, at around 22 weeks of pregnancy. The Texas law, which thus far is the most restrictive in the country, is unique in that it empowers anyone to file a lawsuit against a person who has assisted in an abortion. They can be rewarded with $10,000 for cases that lead to prosecution, prompting charges that the law encourages Texans to act as vigilantes. As Texas can still appeal Pitman's order, the case may end up in front of the Supreme Court. 'Judicial intervention' The nine-justice Supreme Court, with its clear conservative majority, cited procedural issues when it decided last month against intervening to block the law, as pro-choice advocates had requested. It did not rule on the merits of the case. The court had already agreed to review a restrictive Mississippi law that could also provide an opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade. The justices' declining to block the Texas law prompted the Biden administration to enter the fray, citing its interest in upholding Americans' constitutional rights. In court arguments Friday, the US government described the ban as ""a truly extraordinary law designed to outflank the federal government and to violate the constitution."" Attorney William Thompson of the Texas Attorney General's Office accused the government of ""inflammatory rhetoric"" and insisted the law respects Supreme Court precedent. But Judge Pitman retorted: ""If the state's so confident in the constitutionality of the limitations on a woman's access to abortion, then why did it go to such great lengths to create this very unusual private cause of action?"" 'My body, my choice' Tens of thousands of women took to the streets across the United States at the weekend in protests aimed at countering the conservative drive to restrict abortion access. Pro-abortion advocates have called on Congress to enshrine the right to abortion in federal law, so as to protect it from any possible reversal by the Supreme Court. A bill to that effect was adopted two weeks ago in the House of Representatives, which is controlled by Democrats, but has no chance of passing the Senate where Republicans have enough votes to block it. Then-president Donald Trump's appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court emboldened local conservative elected officials across the country to embark on an anti-abortion offensive. If the high court were to overturn Roe v. Wade, every state would be free to ban or allow abortions.   That would mean 36 million women in 26 states -- nearly half of American women of reproductive age -- would likely lose the legal right to an abortion, according to a Planned Parenthood report.

""I will always remember the weekend in the spring when Julie Sweet (CEO of Accenture) and others gathered us together, we met by video and we talked about what was such a terrible tragedy and urgent crisis,"" Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said during the India Ideas Summit of US-India Business Council. A number of top American CEOs gathered over a video call on a weekend that laid the grounds of one of the largest ever humanitarian relief efforts collectively carried out by the country's private sector. ""As we were seeing the rising Covid rates in India, we saw that people's lives literally hung in the balance. We saw what it meant for our own employees, some of whom tragically died as a result of that terrible time,"" he said. ""And yet I think we should also find inspiration that out of that tragedy, we discovered a renewed and expanded capability among ourselves across the business community, in terms of what we can do when we come together,"" Smith told the virtual audience. Smith along with Sweet and Arvind Krishna, CEO and chairman of IBM received USIBC's Global Leadership Humanitarian Award from Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog. ""In that situation, we found that if we worked with each other, we could marshal not only our financial resources, but our expertise, our logistical supply chains, we could get PPE and critical oxygen related equipment, we could buy it, we could move it and we could provide it to the people who needed it so that we could help save lives,"" Smith said. ""We found that when we acted together, we could not only use our resources and our expertise, but we can use our voice. We could use our voice to reach out to governments, including in Washington, DC, and we could persuade them to do more as well,"" he said. ""And what we found is that when we combined forces across the public and private sectors, we had together a capability that I don't think either of us fully appreciated until it was put to the test. The other thing that we took away from that experience was a resolve that we would help, not only the people of India, but elsewhere in the world as well,"" Smith said. On April 23, Sweet said she was with her team and they were looking at the data for that week. Covid cases had surged 160 per cent. ""In making a few calls the next day, it was clear to all of us, many, many companies had this in mind and that we could do more together than any one of us, government, not for profit companies could do alone,"" she said. So, on April 24, Sweet sent out an email at about 9.30 pm on behalf of Krishna and herself and invited several CEOs and organisations to jump on a call at 11:00 am the next day. ""The next day 20 CEOs, representatives of the US Chambers of Commerce, the US India Strategic and Partnership Forum, the Business RoundTable, we all jumped on a call. There was no staff, there were no pre-briefings and no slides,"" she said. ""We were just sharing, hearing from Raj at FedEx about what was happening in logistics; hearing from Alberto and, and Ken, what was happening on the pharma side. All sharing and all united by a single purpose. How can we help?"" Sweet said. ""We often talk about the opportunities with the pandemic to build back better. And this task force is an actual example of us having built back better,"" the Accenture CEO said accepting the award. Observing that the COVID-19 pandemic has been the biggest challenge of lifetimes, Krishna said stopping its spread is a global problem that demands a global response. ""I would also like to recognise that no country has had greater challenges on Covid than India. Protecting so many people and ensuring that accurate information is shared and widely available are daunting tasks. Public private partnerships are critical to pandemic response, as well as solving other big challenges,"" he said.   ""Together, we will continue to expedite medical supplies and other assistance. Defeating COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires collaboration, innovation, and endurance. But I am confident that by continuing to work together, we will find our way through this difficult time and prevail,"" Krishna said.

Many of the victims died when roofs and walls collapsed after the 5.7 magnitude quake struck in the Balochistan province, with a power cut forcing health workers to treat the injured using flashlights. The worst-affected area was the remote mountainous city of Harnai, where a lack of paved roads, electricity and mobile phone coverage hampered rescuers. ""We are receiving information that 20 people have been killed due to the earthquake,"" Balochistan home minister Mir Zia ullah Langau added. A woman and six children were among 20 dead, Suhail Anwar Hashmi, a senior provincial government official, told AFP, adding that ""more than 200 people have been injured"". ""We are soon sending helicopters to the area to help support the rescue operation and to evacuate injured,"" Hashmi said. Naseer Nasar, the head of Balochistan's Provincial Disaster Management Authority, warned that the toll may rise. The quake caused electricity to fail in the region, with health staff working until dawn without lights in a poorly equipped government hospital. Before daybreak, ""we were operating without electricity with the help of torches and mobile flashlights,"" Zahoor Tarin, a senior official at the government-run Harnai hospital told AFP. ""Most of the injured came with fractured limbs. Dozens of people were sent back after first aid,"" he said, adding that ""at least 40 people were received with critical injuries"". ""We have imposed an emergency in the hospital and are providing them medical treatment."" Private individuals were helping rush the injured to hospitals. The US Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 5.7 and struck around 3 am at a depth of around 20 kilometres (12 miles). The earthquake was also felt in Balochistan's capital Quetta. Pakistan straddles the boundary where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet, making the country susceptible to earthquakes. In October 2015, a 7.5-magnitude quake in Pakistan and Afghanistan killed almost 400 people across rugged terrain that impeded relief efforts.   The country was also hit by a 7.6-magnitude quake on October 8, 2005, that killed more than 73,000 people and left about 3.5 million homeless.

In an order on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan granted permission for Andrew's lawyers to receive a copy of the confidential agreement between the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre, the prince's accuser. Giuffre has also accused Epstein of abuse. Epstein's estate had agreed to letting the Duke of York, who is also Queen Elizabeth's second son, review the agreement, but court approval was needed. The prince, 61, has not been charged with crimes, and has ""categorically"" denied Giuffre's claims against him. Andrew Brettler, a lawyer for the prince, said in an email he expects to receive the agreement soon from Giuffre's lawyers. At a hearing last month, Brettler told the judge overseeing Giuffre's lawsuit that he believed the agreement ""absolves our client from any and all liability."" Lawyers for Giuffre did not immediately respond to requests for comment. David Boies, one of the lawyers, said in a court filing last month that he believed the settlement was ""irrelevant"" to Giuffre's case against Andrew. Giuffre, 38, accused the prince of forcing her to have sex when she was underage at the London home of Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell. She also said Andrew abused her at Epstein's mansion in Manhattan, and on Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Andrew faces an Oct. 29 deadline to formally respond to Giuffre's lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages. Epstein, a registered sex offender, killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.   Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to helping recruit and groom underage girls for Epstein to abuse. Her trial in Manhattan is scheduled for Nov. 29.

""These rule tweaks will make travelling more straightforward, supporting businesses and families right across Britain - and allow more of us to see friends and loved ones with greater peace of mind,"" said UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. ""We're striking the right balance between keeping people safe which remains our priority and giving them the freedom to exercise personal responsibility, while supporting the travel sector as it continues to recover,"" she said. The update comes as part of what the British government has described as a ""simplified system"" for international travel, which has seen the replacement of the traffic light system with a single red list, and reduced testing requirements for eligible fully vaccinated travellers. However, vaccinated Indians are yet to benefit from this new system as talks to include India on a list of vaccine eligible countries remain ongoing. UK government sources have said that the extension of vaccine certification to additional countries will be reviewed approximately every three weeks, with the first three-week review mark expected this week. Meanwhile, Indians entering the UK - irrespective of vaccination status - are required to undertake three PCR tests and self-isolate at a declared address. British nationals entering India are subjected to the same rules, as part of retaliatory measures that came into force from Monday. The FCDO said it will continue to advise against all but essential travel for all ""red list"" countries and territories where the risk to British travellers is ""unacceptably high"". It said that it plans to remove advisories for more countries and territories in the coming days. Wednesday's FCDO travel advisory update covers: Algeria; Armenia; Bangladesh; Belarus; Benin; Comoros; Tokelau & Niue; Djibouti; Equatorial Guinea; Fiji; Gambia; Guinea; Kazakhstan; Kiribati; Kosovo; Liberia; Madagascar; Malaysia; Marshall Islands; Micronesia; Nauru; São Tom233; and Príncipe; Senegal; Solomon Islands; Togo; Tonga; Tuvalu; Vanuatu; Congo; America Samoa; French Polynesia; and Ghana. Many travel insurance companies use FCDO travel advice as a reference point in their policies - typically excluding cover for places where government advises against essential travel, however people will now be able to purchase travel insurance for a wider range of destinations across the globe.   The FCDO said the advice for the 32 countries has been lifted in light of the improved public health in these countries and territories, better understanding of the virus and the decreased risk to British nationals as a result of the vaccine roll out.

The New York Times said in a report that ""top American counterintelligence officials warned every CIA station and base around the world last week about troubling numbers of informants recruited from other countries to spy for the United States being captured or killed."" The message was sent in an unusual top secret cable and said that ""the CIA's counterintelligence mission center had looked at dozens of cases in the last several years involving foreign informants who had been killed, arrested or most likely compromised."" The cable also highlighted ""the struggle the spy agency is having as it works to recruit spies around the world in difficult operating environments. In recent years, adversarial intelligence services in countries such as Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan have been hunting down the CIA's sources and in some cases turning them into double agents,"" the NYT report said on Tuesday. The report also said that sometimes, informants who are discovered by adversarial intelligence services are not arrested, ""but instead are turned into double agents who feed disinformation to the CIA, which can have devastating effects on intelligence collection and analysis. Pakistanis have been particularly effective in this sphere,"" the report quoted former officials as saying. ""The collapse of the American-backed government in Afghanistan means that learning more about Pakistan's ties to the Taliban government and extremist organisations in the region is going to become ever more important. As a result, the pressure is once again on the CIA to build and maintain networks of informants in Pakistan, a country with a record of discovering and breaking those networks,"" the NYT report said. The brief cable had also laid out the specific number of agents executed by rival intelligence agencies, the report said, noting that this was usually a closely held detail that counterintelligence officials typically did not share in such messages. ""Acknowledging that recruiting spies is a high-risk business, the cable raised issues that have plagued the agency in recent years, including poor tradecraft; being too trusting of sources; underestimating foreign intelligence agencies, and moving too quickly to recruit informants while not paying enough attention to potential counterintelligence risks - a problem the cable called placing ""mission over security"","" the report said. The report said CIA's assistant director for counterintelligence Sheetal Patel has not been reluctant to send out broad warnings to the CIA community of current and former officers and earlier this year had sent a letter to retired officers of the agency warning against working for foreign governments who are trying to build up spying capabilities by hiring retired intelligence officials. ""The large number of compromised informants in recent years also demonstrated the growing prowess of other countries in employing innovations like biometric scans, facial recognition, artificial intelligence and hacking tools to track the movements of CIA officers in order to discover their sources,"" the NYT report said.   With the CIA devoting bulk of its attention for the last two decades to terrorist threats and the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, the report said improving intelligence collection ""on adversarial powers, both great and small, is once again a centerpiece of the CIA's agenda, particularly as policymakers demand more insight into China and Russia.""

The TMC has earned the trust of the people across the country after its resounding victory against the BJP in the assembly polls held in the state earlier this year, Ms Banerjee asserted in an article titled ""Dilli r Daak (Call of Delhi) in the puja edition of the party mouthpiece ""Jago Bangla"". ""The BJP has failed to digest its defeat in the assembly polls and is pursuing vendetta politics. Right now, there is a new challenge before the TMC - the call of Delhi. The people of this country want respite from the anti-people policies and politics and defeat of the fascist forces,"" she said in the article. After defeating the BJP in the assembly polls, Ms Banerjee visited Delhi in July and held parleys with opposition leaders to explore ways to cobble together an alliance of anti-BJP parties ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. ""The people of the country are now dreaming of a new India around the TMC. Crossing the boundaries of Bengal, the TMC is getting calls from various states. They want that Bengal should lead the fight for a new India. That is why we are saying we have to respond to people's calls. We have to fulfil the wishes of the people and bring together all anti-BJP forces on one platform,"" she said. Veteran Congress leader and former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro recently joined the Trinamool Congress. The party is also eyeing to dislodge the BJP from power in Tripura. Assembly elections in Goa and Tripura are due in 2022 and 2023. Noting that she has never considered keeping the Congress out of a united platform of anti-BJP forces, the TMC boss said such a platform should be based on policies. ""But the fact is, in the recent past, the Congress has failed to put up a fight against the BJP. In the last two Lok Sabha polls, it was proved. If you can't provide a fight at the Centre, it breaks the confidence of the masses, and the BJP gains a few more votes in states. We cannot allow this to happen this time. ""We don't want the leadership of this alliance. But the Congress has to understand and accept the reality or else there will be a gap in the alliance. There should not be any gap, any lacunae in forming an anti-BJP force at the all-India level this time,"" Ms Banerjee said in the article. However, hinting that the TMC is ready to be the driving force to oust the BJP government at the Centre, she claimed that the TMC's development model has defeated the saffron party's juggernaut. ""The people of the country have faith in this (TMC) model. We have to present the most workable model which can meet the aspirations of the people of India. The TMC will not move a step backwards in fulfilling the aspirations of the people,"" she said. Referring to how her party had once emerged as the main opposition face against the CPI(M) regime in West Bengal by outsmarting the Congress, Ms Banerjee said in the article the TMC in recent times has become the ""real opposition against the BJP"".   The article came a week after the TMC's national general secretary and her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, accused the Congress of ''sitting idle"" and indulging in armchair politics and advised it to hit the streets to fight the BJP. The bonhomie between the Congress and the TMC was strained recently after the latter's mouthpiece claimed that party supremo Mamata Banerjee, and not Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, has emerged as the face of the opposition against Prime Minister Narendra Modi."

Tensions with China are at their worst in 40 years, Taiwan's defence minister Chiu Kuo-cheng has said, warning of the risk of an accidental strike between the two. Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political bureau of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), will meet with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Zurich, Switzerland, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Wednesday. Yang, also director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC, will meet with Sullivan ""according to the consensus reached by Chinese and US heads-of-state on September 10 in their phone call and as agreed upon by China and the United States,"" Hua said. ""They will exchange views on China-US relations and relevant issues,"" Hua was quoted as saying by state-run Xinhua news agency. They were expected to discuss among others the People's Liberation Army (PLA) flying at least 150 warplanes into the Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) of Taiwan since the start of China''s National Day holiday on Friday, during both days and nights, official media reports here said. The US Department of State Department voiced ""concern"" over the air exercises, saying the drills are provocative. In response to the statement, Hua said Taiwan is part of China, and the US has no right to make irresponsible comments on the Taiwan question. For its part, China has been criticising the US over the sale of arms to Taiwan under the Washington''s Taiwan Relations Act, which states that the US must help Taiwan defend itself. China claims the estranged islands of Taiwan as part of it and President Xi Jinping has vowed to integrate it with the mainland. ""I've spoken with Xi about Taiwan. We agree ... we'll abide by the Taiwan agreement. We made it clear that I don''t think he should be doing anything other than abiding by the agreement,"" US President Joe Biden said, referring to his recent phone talks with Xi. Analysts suggest that despite the heightened tensions, relations between China and Taiwan have not deteriorated to levels last seen in 1996 when China tried to disrupt presidential elections with missile tests and the US dispatched aircraft carriers to the region to dissuade them. Meanwhile, Taiwan's Defence Minister Chiu said on Wednesday that China could be capable of mounting a ""full-scale"" invasion of Taiwan by 2025. Citing China's large-scale air drills, he said, ""with regards to staging an attack on Taiwan, they currently have the ability. But [China] has to pay the price,"" CNN reported. By 2025, that price will be lower - and China will be able to mount a ""full-scale"" invasion, he said.   Taiwan considers itself a sovereign state. China, however, views Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be reunified with the mainland, even by force. "

Keeping in view the health safety of participants and organisers, carrying out religious activities like ""Anjali, Prasad Bitaran or Sindoor Khela"" should be organised by Puja Committees in a planned manner and to the extent possible in smaller groups with spaced out timings in a staggered way. The guidelines said that priests should use microphones to utter the mantras so that the sound reaches worshippers who will be standing at far off distances and people do not have to assemble closely in small spaces. Devotees may be encouraged to offer ""Anjali with flowers"" brought from homes, so that flower collection points in the pandals do not become congestion points. No cultural programmes in/near the Puja pandal premises will be allowed. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to have physical distancing norms, the state immersion carnival shall not be held this year, as per the guidelines. In a similar move, melas and carnivals near Puja pandals shall not be allowed.   The festival of Navratri will be observed from October 7 till October 15.

The court asked the government to file a status report tomorrow specifying action taken and the eight who were killed on Sunday during a protest against Union Minister Ajay Mishra's visit. The Uttar Pradesh government today announced that a single-member Commission of Enquiry, headed by retired High Court Judge Pradeep Kumar Srivastava will probe Sunday's violence in Lakhimpur Kheri district that led to the death of eight people, including four farmers. The violence in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri, that left eight people including four farmers dead - triggering a major political row over the alleged involvement of a union minister's son, was taken up by a Supreme Court bench led by Chief Justice NV Ramana today. The court has decided to take up the case amid a growing outcry over the Uttar Pradesh police's handling of the investigation, media reports and a letter written to the Chief Justice by two lawyers from the state. The letter had called for a CBI probe under the supervision of the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, BJP MP Varun Gandhi today called for ""accountability for the innocent blood of farmers"" as he tweeted a longer and better quality video that reveals what happened at UP's Lakhimpur Kheri earlier this week - when a black SUV (confirmed by Union Minister Ajay Mishra as belonging to his family) ploughed through a group of farmers holding a peaceful protest. Farmers have vowed to intensify their months-long movement against laws aimed at liberalising agriculture as tension flared after the eight people were killed in clashes between protesters and ruling party supporters on Sunday. Four of the eight were killed when a car belonging to Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra's son Ashish crashed into protesters in Uttar Pradesh state, protest leaders said. And yet four days later, despite being named in a police complaint, he was yet to be arrested. "

The raid, in Paghman district just outside the Afghan capital, followed a bomb attack on a mosque on Sunday claimed by Islamic State, which has mounted a series of operations since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in August. As well as the four prisoners, the raid yielded quantities of weapons and documents, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter. Earlier on Wednesday, Islamic State said on one of its Telegram channels that it had captured and beheaded a member of a Taliban militia force in the eastern city of Jalalabad, where there have been several incidents involving the group in recent days. It was not clear whether there was any direct connection between the incidents in Jalalabad and Paghman. The return of Islamic State's local affiliate, just as the new government is grappling with a potentially catastrophic economic crisis, has added to the mounting array of problems facing the Taliban. The Taliban say they have complete control of the country following the collapse of the Western-backed government of President Ashraf Ghani in August. But remnants of opposition forces made up of former members of the Afghan army and local fighters, under the banner of the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, continue to hold out in Panjshir province, north of Kabul. Mujahid and other Taliban spokesmen have dismissed suggestions of a threat from Islamic State, saying the group has no roots in Afghanistan. But Wednesday's arrests showed it has not been completely eliminated.   Sunday's bomb attack was followed by a prolonged gun battle in the north of Kabul during which an Islamic State cell was destroyed, Taliban officials said. Islamic State Khorasan Province, which takes its name from an ancient name for the region, first emerged in Afghanistan in early 2015. It has clashed repeatedly with the Taliban over economic and ideological differences including the Taliban's rejection of its ideology of global jihad."

The Greater Noida-headquartered 'bike bot' taxi service is accused of duping about 2.25 lakh investors of ₹ 3,000 to ₹ 4,000 crore in multiple states, including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. The attached properties belong to Garvit Innovative Promoters Ltd (GIPL), its promoter Sanjay Bhati and other associate entities involved in the 'bike bot' scam, the ED said in a statement. A provisional order has been issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to attach immovable properties worth ₹ 107.01 crore in the form of flats in 'Saga Habitat' project of Zenith Township Pvt Ltd; university, land and buildings of Arni University, Kangra Himachal Pradesh; under-construction towers in 'Amadeus' project of Saha Infratech Private Limited; and under construction towers in 'White House Project' of Nobel Build tech, it said. Fixed deposits worth ₹ 5.35 crore have also been attached. The total attachment is worth ₹ 112.36 crore. ED Joint Director (Lucknow) Rajeshwar Singh said the agency will try to get the attached properties ""restituted to the poor investors duped in this case"". ""More attachments will be done,"" he added. The ED case is based on an FIR of the Noida Police against the accused company, its promoter Bhati and others. ""GIPL and Bhati, along with others, had floated highly lucrative investment plans in the guise of a 'bike taxi' service by the name of 'bike bot' where a customer could invest in 1, 3, 5 or 7 bikes which would be maintained and operated by the company and the investor would be paid monthly rent, EMI and bonus (in case of investment in multiple bikes) and further incentives on adding additional investors in a binary or multi-level marketing structure,"" it said. The company also allotted franchisees in various cities but the bike taxi hardly operated in these cities, the ED said. The plans were floated in August 2017 and the collection of money from investors/customers and repayments to them continued till early 2019, it said. In November 2018, the company floated similar plans for e-bikes stating that the petrol bikes were facing issues regarding registration and operation. ""The subscription amount for the e-bikes was almost double the investment amounts for regular petrol bikes,"" it said.   ""An analysis of bank accounts shows that the funds have been diverted to purchase some immovable properties in the name of Garvit Innovative Promoters Ltd and also to take control of the trusts running the various institutes,"" the ED said.

Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the reasons cited by Sky News for the reduction of the Russian delegation. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin or the Russian foreign ministry. The West's ties with Russia remain strained over everything from Ukraine to alleged Russian election meddling to the 2018 poisoning with a nerve agent in England of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. The Interfax news agency cited Leonid Slutsky, head of the Russian lower house of parliament's international affairs committee, as saying that Moscow would retaliate, but not necessarily in kind. ""We can confirm that we have withdrawn the accreditation of eight members of the Russian Mission to NATO, who were undeclared Russian intelligence officers,"" the NATO official said, adding that the number of positions Moscow can accredit to NATO had been cut to 10. ""NATO's policy towards Russia remains consistent.

Slutsky was cited as saying that the position of Russia's envoy to the European Union was currently vacant and that NATO's move would damage dialogue between Moscow and the West.   ""The collective West is continuing its policy of diplomatic confrontation with Russia,"" said Slutsky.

There's a 10-year waiting period to get Indian citizenship and during which they will be stripped of their right to vote. Bhandari Das' lawyer Tanmoy Purkayastha said that her case came to the notice of the Foreigners Tribunal in 2008 - 41 years after she came to India - when a Border Police registered a case against her. ""Usually, the Border Police sends a notice to the person whom they suspect as foreigners and when they don't have an answer to that, the case goes to the Tribunal. In this case, however, they directly registered a case without informing her which got forwarded to the tribunal,"" the lawyer added.   Bhandari Das and her son, who appears in the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) of 2019, had submitted the same documents to the Tribunal that they submitted for NRC - the refugee card from 1967 and voter Identity card issued in 1970 - to prove their legacy before March 24, 1971. The Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, the rules of which are being drawn, may come as an aid to Bhandari Das and other ""streamline foreigners"" like her as it promises citizenship to those religious minorities from our three neighbours - Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan."

Mohammed used the sophisticated ""Pegasus"" software, developed by Israeli firm NSO for states to counter national security risks, to hack the phones of Princess Haya bint al-Hussein, half-sister of Jordan's King Abdullah, and some of those closely connected to her, according to the rulings. Those working for him also tried to buy a mansion next door to Haya's estate near the British capital, intimidatory action that the court ruled had left her feeling hunted, unsafe and like she ""cannot breathe anymore"". The latest rulings come 19 months after the court concluded that Mohammed had abducted two of his daughters, mistreated them and held them against their will. ""The findings represent a total abuse of trust, and indeed an abuse of power to a significant extent,"" Judge Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division in England and Wales, said in his ruling. The sheikh rejected the court's conclusions, saying they were based on an incomplete picture. ""I have always denied the allegations made against me and I continue to do so,"" he said in a statement. ""In addition, the findings were based on evidence that was not disclosed to me or my advisers. I therefore maintain that they were made in a manner which was unfair."" Mohammed, 72, and Haya, 47, have been involved in a long, bitter and expensive custody battle since she fled to Britain with their two children, Jalila, 13, and Zayed, 9. She said she feared for her safety amid suspicions that she had had an affair with one of her British bodyguards. Among those targeted by the hacking was Haya's lawyer Fiona Shackleton, a member of Britain's House of Lords who represented British heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles in his divorce from his late first wife Princess Diana. The activity came to light in August last year after Shackleton was urgently tipped off by Cherie Blair, the wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, that she and Haya had been hacked, the court was told. Blair is also a prominent lawyer who worked as an external adviser for NSO. At the same time a cyber expert from the University of Toronto's internet watchdog Citizen Lab, which researches digital surveillance, also alerted Haya's lawyers after tracking the hacking, the court heard. Once the hacking was uncovered, NSO cancelled its contract with the UAE, Haya's lawyers said. The Israeli firm said it could not immediately comment on the case, but said it took action if it received evidence of misuse of Pegasus. Shackleton and Blair declined to comment. Mohammed is regarded as the visionary force behind Dubai's ascent into a global commercial hub. He has sought to burnish the Gulf city's reputation on issues such as human rights and equality. There is no indication that last year's ruling caused any major damage to him personally or to the UAE. Last month Britain and the UAE announced a ""new, ambitious Partnership for the Future"" involving billions of dollars in trade and investment. Long, Expensive Battle Reporting restrictions on McFarlane's findings after a year of hearings were lifted on Wednesday. ""I do not feel that I can move freely forward as things stand now, while I am and feel hunted all the time, and I am forced to look over my shoulder at every moment of the day,"" the British-educated princess said in one witness statement. The legal costs of the case have run into millions of pounds, with the case involving some of Britain's most prominent lawyers. The costs of one appeal alone was cited by the court as costing 2.5 million pounds. The sheikh, who is vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, initially sought to have the children brought back to Dubai, but has since suffered repeated defeats in the English courts. In a judgment released on Wednesday, McFarlane ruled that the children should live with their mother. In a ruling published last March, the judge concluded that Mohammed had subjected Haya to a campaign of intimidation which made her fear for her life. He concluded the sheikh had arranged for his daughter Shamsa, then aged 18, to be kidnapped in 2000 off the streets of Cambridge in central England and flown back to Dubai. The judge also found it was proved that Mohammed had arranged for Shamsa's younger sister Latifa to be snatched from a boat in international waters off India by Indian forces in 2018 and returned to the emirate. While his findings do not amount to a determination of criminal guilt, they mean McFarlane is satisfied the allegations are proven on the balance of probabilities and that this may impact arrangements for contact with his children in the future. ""As the previous findings of fact establish, the father, who is the head of government of the UAE, is prepared to use the arm of the state to achieve what he regards as right,"" he said. ""He has harassed and intimidated the mother both before her departure to England and since. He is prepared to countenance those acting on his behalf doing so unlawfully within the UK."" Friends With Queen Haya's lawyers told the court that the British Foreign Office had been made aware of the hacking allegations, and police had expressed a desire to interview Haya and her lawyers as victims. Reuters was unable to establish if this took place. London's police said detectives began a five-month investigation last year after receiving allegations of phone hacking. But in February, the investigation was closed because of a lack of ""further investigative opportunities"". There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry. It is not the first time the UAE's cyber activities have come under scrutiny. Last month, three former U.S. intelligence operatives, who worked as UAE cyber spies, admitted to violating U.S. hacking laws to spy on human rights activists, journalists and rival governments. During the London hearings, Mohammed's high powered team of lawyers battled for months to prevent the court from considering the hacking allegations, by saying it did not have the jurisdiction and that he had immunity, and then by trying to persuade the judge that the sheikh was not responsible. Saudi Arabia and Jordan were amongst a host of other countries that could have been behind it, his legal team said. McFarlane dismissed those suggestions, saying the idea it could be Jordan was ""so insubstantial as to be without consequence"" and was critical of how the sheikh had instructed his lawyers to act on his behalf. In his statement, Mohammed said it was not appropriate for him to appear in court himself and neither the UAE nor the emirate itself were party to the case and so could not participate. Instead of showing any concern for the safety of the mother of his children, ""he has marshalled a formidable forensic team to challenge the findings sought by the mother and to fight the case against her on every point,"" McFarlane said. He concluded, and the Court of Appeal agreed, that the sheikh had authorised the hacking of six phones which took place between July and August 2020 when a vulnerability in Apple's iPhone systems was exploited. Expert cyber analysis revealed that on one occasion 265 megabytes of data were downloaded from Haya's phone, the equivalent of 24 hours of voice recording or 500 photos. Exactly how much data and what information was taken from her and the other phones has not been determined. Haya and Mohammed have been fixtures in British high society for decades and both are on friendly terms with members of the British royal family including Queen Elizabeth. The sheikh, through the Godolphin stable which he founded, is a major player and investor in the British horse racing industry. His horse Adayar won this year's famous Epsom Derby flat race. McFarlane also extended the provisions of a previous non-molestation order, which banned the sheikh from buying any land or property near her estate in rural Berkshire, west of London, after his agents tried to buy an adjoining 30 million pound mansion which overlooked her home.

The video appears to contest claims by the minister Ajay Mishra and his son that their Mahindra Thar was under attack - it shows no stones or sticks being thrown at the car - and that the driver lost control resulting in the death of at least four farmers and injuries to many more. In this video, the driver seems to holding on to the steering wheel firmly and driving at great speed into a group of farmers marching in front of the SUV, with their backs to it. NDTV cannot verify the authenticity of the video or the sequence of events that led to it. According to witnesses, it was after this incident, that an enraged mob attacked the cars, set them on fire and four people in the convoy were beaten to death. A lower resolution, slowed-down version of the same video was earlier shared by a series of opposition leaders as proof that the blame for the Sunday's clashes - that left eight people dead in all and many injured - lay on the convoy of minister's aides and BJP workers. The farmers had gathered for a demonstration in the Uttar Pradesh district, where the junior home affairs minister Ajay Mishra and the state's deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had been due to visit. Farmer groups have claimed that Mr Mishra's son had been in a car in the minister's convoy, or was driving it, when the vehicle ran over four protesters, killing them. He has denied this charge. The incident marked a deadly escalation of the farmers' year-long campaign against controversial agriculture laws.   The new video emerged on a day when the Supreme Court announced it was taking up the case as media reports and a letter from two lawyers to Chief Justice NV Ramana cast doubts on the Uttar Pradesh police's investigation into the incident. Four days after a murder case was filed against him, the minister's son Ashish Mishra was yet to be arrested and government sources ruled out the minister Ajay Mishra resignation following a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah."

The statement of Banerjee, also the TMC supremo, came on a day when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was stopped from visiting the area in Uttar Pradesh where eight people were killed - four farmers were allegedly run over by a car and four people in a convoy of BJP workers who were lynched - during a peasants' protest on Sunday. Mr Gandhi on Wednesday evening reached Sitapur where some party office-bearers, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, have been in detention since Monday after their failed bid to meet the affected families. ""We condemn the killing of farmers in Uttar Pradesh. The farmers were brutally murdered. Only a TMC delegation was able to reach the village and meet the family members.

Trump's comments came as top officials from China and the US are due to hold talks in Switzerland amid heightened tensions over the Chinese army conducting a record number of air drills close to Taiwan, a self-ruled island which Beijing views as a breakaway province. The world's two largest economies have spent 18 months embroiled in a bitter trade dispute that imposed tit-for-tat levies on each other's commodities, mechanical parts and finished goods. Trump had launched a trade war with China in 2018 demanding Beijing to reduce the massive trade deficit. The relations between China and the US are at an all time low. The two countries are currently engaged in a bitter confrontation over various issues, including trade, the origins of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the communist giant's aggressive military moves in the disputed South China Sea and human rights. “Because the election was rigged, and America now has weak and corrupt leadership, we may very well end up in a war with China who no longer respects the USA,” Trump, a Republican, said in a statement, attacking his successor President Joe Biden, a Democrat. They witnessed firsthand ""our generals' complete surrender to the Taliban with the loss of 13 great warriors and the handing over of USD 85 billion of the best and most expensive Military equipment in the World— China and Russia are already reverse engineering the equipment so they can build it for themselves,” Trump said.   The US withdrew its troops from Afghanistan in August, ending its two-decade-long military war in the war-torn country. Attack by two suicide bombers and a gunmen outside the Kabul airport at the height of evacuation on August 26 left 13 US marines along with over 150 civilians dead.

The decision followed a review of a pilot programme deployed since 2019 in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi in which more than two million doses were given of the vaccine, first made by the pharmaceutical company GSK in 1987. After reviewing evidence from those countries, the WHO said it was ""recommending the broad use of the world's first malaria vaccine"", the agency's director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The WHO said it was recommending children in sub-Saharan Africa and in other regions with moderate to high malaria transmission get four doses up to the age of two. Every two minutes, a child dies of malaria, the agency said. More than half of malaria deaths worldwide are in six sub-Saharan African countries and almost a quarter are in Nigeria alone, according to 2019 WHO figures. Symptoms include fever, headaches and muscle pain, then cycles of chills, fever and sweating. Findings from the vaccine pilot showed it ""significantly reduces severe malaria which is the deadly form by 30 percent,"" said Kate O'Brien, Director of WHO's Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. The vaccine is ""feasible to deliver"", she added and ""it's also reaching the unreached... Two thirds of children who don't sleep under a bed net in those countries are now benefiting from the vaccine."" Many vaccines exist against viruses and bacteria but this was the first time that the WHO recommended for broad use a vaccine against a human parasite. The vaccine acts against plasmodium falciparum -- one of five malaria parasite species and the most deadly. ""From a scientific perspective this is a massive breakthrough,"" said Pedro Alonso, Director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme. 'Glimmer of hope' Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa said Wednesday's recommendation ""offers a glimmer of hope for the continent which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease."" The estimated cost of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa is over 12 billion dollars a year, Alonso said at a news conference following the announcement. Before the newly recommended vaccine can reach children in need, the next step will be funding. ""That will be the next major step... Then we will be set up for scaling of doses and decisions about where the vaccine will be most useful and how it will be deployed,"" said O'Brien. Gavi vaccine alliance said in a statement after the WHO announcement that ""global stakeholders, including Gavi, will consider whether and how to finance a new malaria vaccination programme for countries in sub-Saharan Africa."" The fight against malaria received a boost in April when researchers from Britain's Oxford University announced that their Matrix-M vaccine candidate had become the first to surpass the WHO's threshold of 75-percent efficacy. Germany's BioNTech, which developed a coronavirus vaccine with US giant Pfizer, also said it aimed to start trials for a malaria vaccine next year using the same breakthrough mRNA technology.   The WHO also hopes this latest recommendation will encourage scientists to develop more malaria vaccines. The RTS,S/AS01 is ""a first generation, really important one,"" said Alonso, ""but we hope... it stimulates the field to look for other types of vaccines to completement or go beyond this one."""

Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Vinod Yadav has been hearing several riots cases at the Karkardooma District Courts here has been transferred to New Delhi district's Rouse Avenue Court as Special Judge (PC Act) (CBI) in place of Judge Virender Bhatt who will now be holding the post of ASJ in Karkardooma court. The public notice issued by the Delhi High Court listing the names of the judges who have been transferred said: ""Hon'ble the Chief Justice and Hon'ble Judges of this Court have been pleased to make the following postings/transfers in the Delhi Higher Judicial Service with immediate effect."" The judicial officers under transfer have been directed to notify the cases in which they have reserved judgements or orders before relinquishing the charge, the public notice undersigned by Registrar General Manoj Jain said. ASJ Yadav, a day before his transfer, came down heavily on Delhi police saying ""Police witnesses are lying on oath"" and giving contradictory statements. The observation came during the hearing of a northeast Delhi riots case after one policeman identified three alleged rioters but another said that they could not be identified during the investigation. ""This is a very sorry state of affairs,"" Yadav had said and sought a report from the Deputy Commissioner of Police (northeast) in this regard. The judge has been disapproving the investigation conducted by the Delhi Police in some of the riots cases and has pulled them up at times for a ""callous and farcical"" probe and even imposed a fine, which was later challenged in the high court. In the last few months, he has repeatedly sought the intervention of Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana to monitor the probe and take action against the erring police officers. In September, he had come down heavily on the police, saying that their failure to conduct a proper investigation will torment the ""sentinels of democracy"" when history will look back at the worst communal riots in the city since partition. In another case, Yadav had said that the standard of investigation in a large number of 2020 northeast riots cases is ""very poor"". ""This is really a sorry state of affairs,"" he had observed in another case. He also objected to the ""wrongly-clubbed FIRs"" and recently ordered the separation of a trial based on their religion.   Last year, the Delhi High Court had designated two sessions and two magisterial courts for the trial of communal violence cases registered in northeast and Shahdara districts of the national capital. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020, after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiraled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured."

The court has decided to take up the case amid a growing outcry over the Uttar Pradesh police's handling of the investigation, media reports and a letter written to the Chief Justice by two lawyers from the state. The letter had called for a CBI probe under the supervision of the Supreme Court. Farmers have vowed to intensify their months-long movement against laws aimed at liberalising agriculture as tension flared after the eight people were killed in clashes between protesters and ruling party supporters on Sunday. Four of the eight were killed when a car belonging to Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra's son Ashish crashed into protesters in Uttar Pradesh state, protest leaders said. And yet four days later, despite being named in a police complaint, he was yet to be arrested. The police have said they were investigating the crash and had registered a case against 13 people, including Ashish Mishra even as his father ruled out resigning and held a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi. Mr Mishra said his son was not present at the incident but a car driven by ""our driver"" lost control and hit the farmers after they threw stones at the car and attacked it with sticks and sword. Ashish Mishra has also denied being present and remains at large. An alliance of protest groups called in a petition to President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday for a court-supervised investigation of the violence. The legislation the farmers object to, introduced in September last year, deregulates the sector, allowing farmers to sell produce to buyers beyond government-regulated wholesale markets, where growers are assured of a minimum price. Small farmers say the changes make them vulnerable to competition from big business, and that they could eventually lose price supports for staples such as wheat and rice.   The government says reform of the sector, which accounts for about 15 per cent of the $2.7 trillion economy, mean new opportunities and better prices for farmers. India's longest-running farm protests pose a risk for the re-election prospects of the BJP when Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, goes to the polls early next year."

Lt General Nadeem Anjum was appointed as the new Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in place of Lt General Hameed, who was transferred as Peshawar Corps Commander, said the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) the media wing of the Pakistan Army. The ISI chief is appointed by the prime minister but as part of a tradition he executes this power in consultation with the Pakistan Army chief. The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 73 plus years of existence and has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy. Initially, the Army said in a statement that Lt Geneneral Hameed was posted out but his replacement on the key post of the ISI chief was not immediately announced. Lt General Anjum, who belongs to the Punjab Regiment of the Pakistan Army, has served as Karachi Corps Commander as well as the commandant of Command and Staff College Quetta. He is considered as a battle-hardened soldier who commanded the Frontier Corps Balochistan as its Inspector General and oversaw many operations against terrorists.   Media reports said that his subordinates call him the ""man with glacier brain but sharp reflexes"". He is stated to be a good listener and good observer who speaks concisely. "

This is the second-most delayed withdrawal of the Southwest Monsoon since 1960. Monsoon withdrawal from northwest India in 2019 started on October 9, according to RK Jenamani, senior forecaster with the National Weather Forecasting Centre of the IMD. The withdrawal of the Southwest Monsoon from northwest India usually begins from September 17. The wind system is expected to retreat from Delhi in three to four days. ""In view of the establishment of an anti-cyclonic circulation in the lower tropospheric levels over western parts of northwest India and substantial reduction in moisture content and rainfall, the withdrawal of the Southwest Monsoon has commenced,"" the IMD said in a statement. The Southwest Monsoon has withdrawn from some parts of West Rajasthan and adjoining Gujarat, it said, adding that the withdrawal line passes through Bikaner, Jodhpur, Jalore, Bhuj and Lat. ""Conditions are favourable for further withdrawal of the Southwest Monsoon from some more parts of Gujarat, entire Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and some parts of Madhya Pradesh during the next three to four days,"" the MeT Department said. The monsoon withdrawal started on September 28 last year, October 9 in 2019, September 29 in 2018, September 27 in 2017 and September 15 in 2016, according to IMD data. The country received ""normal"" rainfall during the four-month Southwest Monsoon season from June to September. All India monsoon rainfall during June 1 to September 30 has been 87 cm against the Long Period Average of 88 cm of 1961-2010 (99 percent of its LPA). This is for the third consecutive year that the country has recorded rainfall in the normal or above normal category. Rainfall was above normal in 2019 and 2020. The rainfall over the country as a whole was 110 per cent in June, 93 and 76 per cent in July and August respectively -- the months that bring the maximum rains. However, the shortfall of July and August was compensated in September which recorded rainfall 135 per cent of the LPA. The Southwest Monsoon made its onset over Kerala on June 3, after a delay of two days. It rapidly covered central, west, east, northeast and south India by June 15. It also covered many parts of north India, even Barmer and Jaisalmer, its last outposts, but the monsoon winds failed to reach Delhi, parts of Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh. It then witnessed a lull. It finally covered Delhi, parts of Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh, on July 13, five days after its normal onset date, belying IMD's forecasts.   The Northeast Monsoon, which brings rainfall to southern states from October to December, is likely to be normal, according to the IMD.

""Listen, Mr Singh!"" warned Justice DY Chandrachud, repeating himself three times, after taking off his mask, urging the lawyer, Vikas Singh, to change course. When that did not work, the judge said, ""Do not raise your voice. Listen to us."" Sanjay Chandra was arrested in 2017 along with his brother, Ajay, for allegedly gypping lakhs of people who bought houses that were never built. The Chandras now face charges that range from money laundering to embezzlement. On Monday, Sanjay Chandra's wife, Preeti, was arrested along with his father, Ramesh Chandra, who is 80. ""You have arrested my father, my wife, arrest my children also. Put us all behind bars,"" complained Vikas Singh speaking on behalf of his client. Vikas Singh said that the court must share documents that apparently indict his client like the forensic audit report prepared by Grant Thornton on Unitech's finances so that the Chandras can refute the charges. He said they are legally entitled to access this material. ""I don't want your lordships to repent later that you did not take timely action. I am sure the court has nothing personal against the Chandras,"" the lawyer said. ""Before you make allegations against the court... what is this language? This is not the way to argue - to say 'you will repent later',"" Justice Chandrachud countered. The Chandra brothers were moved five weeks ago from Tihar Jail in Delhi to separate prisons in Mumbai after the Enforcement Directorate said in court that they had colluded with prison officials who enabled them to continue operating their business from within jail. The agency also said that the Chandras had created an ""underground"" or ""secret"" office where they stashed information relevant to the investigation against them.   On Wednesday, a group of Tihar officials were suspended on the orders of the Supreme Court for illicitly helping the Chandras. In 2017, the government was allowed to take over the management control of Unitech, a rare intervention which the government said would help those who had paid the company for homes that were never delivered to them."

Notably, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel have announced a compensation of ₹ 50 lakhs separately to the family of four farmers who died in the Lakhimpur incident.

Mr Gandhi was accompanied by senior party leaders including Bhupesh Baghel, Charanjit Channi, KC Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala. As many as eight people died in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident on Sunday, said Uttar Pradesh police. Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of several farmer unions, alleged that Ashish Mishra Teni, son of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra Teni arrived with three vehicles around the time that farmers were dispersing from their protest. The farmer group alleged that Ashish Mishra Teni's son mowed down farmers and attacked SKM leader Tajinder Singh Virk directly, by trying to run a vehicle over him.

""The BJP government has surpassed the atrocities committed by the British. Its minister of state of home is threatening farmers to suppress their voice. Such tone and tenor should not be there in democracy,"" Mr Yadav said, addressing a program at Sunaseer Nath Gurudwara. ""There were cruel rulers in the world but in the BJP regime, the voice of democracy is being crushed. In the nearby Lakhimpur district, Sikhs and farmers were crushed and killed.

He said if the Centre's three farm laws were implemented, then the farmers will have no benefit. Attacking Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Mr Yadav said the person who is ruling is not a 'yogi', because ""a yogi remains at a distance from desires, and understands grief and problems of others.""

The world's fifth worst-hit country with more than 7.5 million infections, Russia has seen cases climb since August driven by the contagious Delta variant and a sluggish vaccinations drive. A government tally recorded 929 Covid-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, Russia's highest daily virus death count since the outbreak of the pandemic. Several Russia-made jabs have been available for months, but authorities have struggled to encourage its vaccine-sceptic population to get inoculated. Polls show that more than half of Russians do not plan to get a shot. As of Wednesday, just under 30 percent of Russia's 146 million population had been fully vaccinated, according to the Gogov website, which tallies Covid-19 data from the regions. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said earlier this week that death rates were high among unvaccinated Russians. The surging infections have come without any real pandemic restrictions to limit the spread, but several regions have re-introduced QR codes for access to public places. Moscow -- the epicentre of Russia's outbreak -- has so far held back on reintroducing restrictions. - 'Far from the peak' - Kremlin spokesman Dmity Peskov said on Wednesday lockdowns would be ""an absolutely undesirable scenario for any region"". He also poured cold water on any nationwide measures saying regions were ""taking action individually"". In the capital, authorities say that the highly contagious Delta variant now accounts for all of the cases. Speaking at a government meeting on Tuesday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said his city was ""far from peak numbers"" and the growing infections are largely linked to high detection rates. Two thirds of Moscow's hospital beds for coronavirus patients are currently occupied, he said. In September, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, 68, self-isolated for two weeks after dozens of coronavirus cases were detected in his inner circle.   Russian authorities have been accused of downplaying the severity of the outbreak and, after a tight first lockdown in 2020, have refrained from introducing restrictive new measures. The new deaths bring Russia's total fatalities from coronavirus to 212,625 -- the highest toll in Europe."

Last week, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had submitted a list of 13 documents, which include the 'spot panchnama', 'inquest panchnama', seizure of cloths and articles of Dabholkar, and various other documents, considered evidence in the case. As charges have been framed in the 2013 murder case, the prosecution had submitted a list of documents to Additional Sessions Judge S R Navandar (special judge for UAPA cases). Defence counsel, Suvarna Avhad said they refused to admit the documents submitted by the prosecution. ""We moved an application before the court stating that the defence rejects all the documents submitted by the prosecution. We told the court that we will be contesting the documents during the trial,"" she said. CBI's special public prosecutor Prakash Suryawanshi said the defence rejected all the documents. ""They are not admitting anything. In normal cases, the documents like a spot panchnama, inquest panchnama are generally admitted by the defence but in the present case it is their choice whether to accept it or not,"" he said. ""I will prove these documents by examining my witnesses. I will submit a list of documents and witnesses and will start with the examination,"" he said. Meanwhile, Avhad said the judge had passed an order about an article published in a Marathi daily and said that an inference can be drawn that the article was published with 'malafide intention'. She said the court did not take any action (in connection with the newspaper article) but cautioned that due care should have been taken. The defence had moved a plea before the court along with the newspaper article seeking to initiate a process to issue a contempt of court notice against the author, editor and the publication for publishing the article. According to the defence's application, the (author) of the article claims that this court (of additional sessions judge, before whose court the trial us undergoing) is conducting a trial without authority as the case involved sections under the UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act). Dabholkar (67), who headed anti-superstition outfit Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti, was shot dead in Pune on August 20, 2013, allegedly by members of a right-wing extremist group. The CBI has been conducting a probe into the case which was earlier with the Pune police. Virendra Sinh Tawde, Sachin Andure, Sharad Kalaskar, Sanjeev Punalekar and Vikram Bhave are five accused arrested in the case.   The court framed the charges against Tawde, Andure, Kalaskar and Bhave under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 302 (Punishment for murder), 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), 34 (common intention), the Arms Act and section 16 of the stringent UAPA (punishment for terrorist act). Besides, charges were framed against Punalekar under IPC section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence or giving false information to screen offender).

Priyanka has much to thank Yogi Adityanath for. The UP Chief Minister has managed what legions of Congress cronies could not: he has given Priyanka's image a huge boost and helped turn her into a liberal heroine. Consider the background. Priyanka joined politics (at least in terms of accepting a party position) two years ago and was given charge of UP. The general election result that followed was a disaster for the Congress but people were willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. But even after that election was over, the Congress did not seem to be making any kind of electoral comeback in UP. Most commentators reckoned that it would do badly in the forthcoming assembly election as well. Meanwhile, Priyanka busied herself with managing Navjot Singh Sidhu's dissidence campaign in Punjab and in destabilizing one of the Congress's few Chief Ministers. When the party got rid of Captain Amarinder Singh, there were those who said that Sidhu's victory was also Priyanka's victory: she may not have been able to defeat the BJP, but she had, at least, defeated someone - a Congress Chief Minister she was opposed to. That view went out of the window when a sulking Sidhu suddenly resigned as Congress party chief in Punjab and had to be persuaded to withdraw his resignation by being offered face-savers. Suddenly, it began to look as if Priyanka's political instincts were all wrong and that her interference in Congress matters was doing the party more harm than good. That was how things stood when Priyanka set off for Lakhimpur Kheri. Had she reached there, she would certainly have made common cause with the farmers and expressed her outrage over the deaths that occurred when a car belonging to a BJP union minister mowed down farmers. Other Opposition leaders were also due to visit (including Akhilesh Yadav) and so there would have been a 24-hour media storm over Opposition protests till the news cycle moved on. Enter Yogi Adityanath. Rather than take a long-term view, the UP Chief Minister panicked. He asked the police to detain Priyanka in the dead of night to prevent her from visiting the site of the agitation. There were all kinds of legal issues with this arrest: can the police arrest a woman after sundown? Can an arrest be made without any warrant? Was it an arrest, as Priyanka claimed, or a detention? And certainly, the police had no business manhandling her. When the video of the arrest went viral along with Priyanka's angry response, it began to seem as though the UP government was frightened of Priyanka. It was one courageous woman versus the might of Yogi's powerful state administration. Then, the mistakes piled up. Priyanka was detained in a guest house but allowed access to her phone. She used it to give interviews to TV channels, to shoot videos and even to address Congress workers who had assembled to hear her speak. Akhilesh Yadav was detained in Lucknow. Bhupesh Baghel staged a dharna at Lucknow airport when he was refused entry into the state. The Deputy Chief Minister of Punjab was also stopped from going to the site. But the image that caught the public imagination was none of these. It was the one of the arrest and the subsequent detention of Priyanka. For all his big talk and his armed battalions, Yogi Adityanath came across as a little man frightened of a single, brave woman. At a stroke, Yogi had transformed Priyanka's image from inept backroom schemer to the heir of Indira Gandhi, standing up to those in power on behalf of the helpless. Eventually, somebody more grown up than Yogi in Delhi gave Adityanath a talking-to and he agreed, in his own fumbling way, to let Rahul Gandhi and others visit Priyanka, and then, the site of the deaths. But by then, the damage was done. Yogi Adityanath had done what election strategist Prashant Kishore aka ""PK"" had not managed to do: he refurbished Priyanka Gandhi's image. Though the younger Gandhis often act as though they do not understand this, the reason they find it hard to win public acceptance (let alone win elections) is because they are seen as entitled children of a once royal family who demand power as their birthright. For them to erase that image, they need to be seen to suffer, to fight it out, to not be frightened of any danger to their person, and to bravely challenge authority. Thanks to Yogi Adityanath, Priyanka was able to do all that in the space of a few hours. Will this make a huge difference to the Congress's prospects in UP? Probably not. The situation is developing and a lot could still happen. Priyanka herself could eventually return to Delhi and return to backroom manouvering and the nourishment of more dissidents. But as of now, it is hard to deny that she has finally emerged as a credible political leader in her own right. And, of all people, it was Yogi Adityanath who made that possible!

""Sunday evening we were all together - my children were there too. But she is always working, even when we spend time as a family. She suddenly told us that she needs to leave for UP... it was shortly after 8 pm. She told me what happened and that she wants to go and meet the families of all those who died in the incident,"" Mr Vadra told NDTV in an interview. ""They detained her and gave her a dirty room, so she cleaned it. We spoke a few times, but then they cut all mobile networks, and so communications were cut-off. They even told me that if I tried to come, I would be stopped too. A BJP spokesperson also said that 'these people are coming here only for a photo-op',"" he said. ""I am glad Rahul [Gandhi] could go... I hope they let him meet his sister. Someone from the family had to be there. I am here with my children, who are very worried for their mother. They ask 'Is Ma okay?'. We all had seen what had happened even in Hathras, when they caught hold of her neck,"" he added. ""Priyanka is a very determined and strong-headed person. If she has taken a pledge to meet the victims, then she will definitely meet her, no matter how difficult the government makes it for her. She will only return after meeting the families of the victims,"" Mr Vadra said. ""What are they so afraid of? Why can't they just let her meet them? She is travelling alone... a woman, alone... what can she do? Are they afraid of her? Or are they afraid they will lose their seat or will lose power?"" he said. ""She plans to meet all the families - all those who have died... she does not differentiate, so she will meet all those who died. The whole nation is now looking at the way things were handled,"" Mr Vadra said. Earlier on Wednesday, in a Facebook post, Mr Vadra said he had been stopped from going to Lucknow to ""check on my wife and make sure she is fine and well"". He also expressed shock that his wife had not been allowed to meet her legal counsel while in police custody. Ms Gandhi Vadra was arrested Monday while on her way to Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri to visit the families of farmers killed in Sunday's violence. She had alleged she is being illegally held at a police compound in Sitapur (around 50 km from Lakhimpur Kheri). Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's extended detention - she has now been allowed to visit farmers' families - triggered protests from the Congress and other parties, including Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena. Her brother and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi was also been denied permission before being cleared later; Mr Gandhi, who reached UP on Wednesday, called the state government's actions a ""systematic attack on farmers"" and said he would defy the order. At the time of her arrest, orders banning the gathering of more than four persons were in place in Lakhimpur Kheri, where four farmers were run over by a convoy of vehicles that allegedly included one driven by Union Minister Ajay Mishra's son. Four more died in the violence that followed. UP police have said the case against Ms Gandhi Vadra, and 10 others, relates to preventive detention due to apprehension of breach of peace.   However, she has said she was travelling in a small group - only four people with her - and that eight of those named by the police were not even present.

Eight policemen were accused of staging an encounter of a B.Tech student. Pradeep, a resident of Sahpani, was killed in an encounter in the Sikandrabad area of the district in 2002 after he was shown to be involved in a bus robbery case. The investigation of the case was handed over to the Crime Branch - Criminal Investigation Department (CBCID), which had submitted its closure report in the court. Based on a complaint by the victim's father Yashpal, a trial court began proceedings in the case, during which summons and warrants were issued against policemen involved in the encounter. Four policemen have since been granted bail by the court. Warrants were being issued against the rest. One of the accused surrendered before the court on September 20, while two others were arrested by the district police on September 22 and 24.

Sanjay and his older brother, Ajay, are the former owners of Unitech, which was one of India's real estate majors for several years. The brothers were arrested in 2017 for failing to build houses for which they had collected thousands of crores. They also face charges of money-laundering and other financial crimes. Earlier this week, Sanjay Chandra's wife, Preeti Chandra, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on charges of money-laundering, along with her father-in-law Ramesh Chandra, who is 80, and set up Unitech and ran the company with his sons. The Enforcement Directorate had last month complained in the Supreme Court that the Chandras had been allowed special privileges while in prison by corrupt jail officials. The court then ordered that the brothers should be relocated to prisons in Mumbai and be lodged separately. Today's order for action against the jail officials includes an FIR or police case for criminal conspiracy; it is not known yet how many Tihar officers have been punished - details were shared with the court in a sealed cover. The policemen who have been suspended today were named in a report reviewed by Delhi top cop Rakesh Asthana. In 2017, the government was allowed to take over the management control of Unitech, a rare intervention which the government said would help those who had paid the company for homes that were never delivered to them.   The government sought permission from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to appoint new directors to the board of Unitech, citing mismanagement and siphoning of funds. Unitech owed about 7.24 billion rupees ($112.34 million) to 51,000 depositors who had placed funds with the company to earn higher interest rates than typically available in banks, government lawyers said."

His confusion about the definition arose during an interview with the BBC in which he was asked why the government rejected calls for misogyny to be made a hate crime in the wake of the murder of London woman Sarah Everard. ""If you don't know what misogyny is then you're never going to find it,"" Nazir Afzal, who has prosecuted grooming gangs and celebrity sexual abusers, wrote on Twitter. Misogyny is hatred aimed at women, while misandry targets men. ""What I meant was... if we are talking about, effectively, insults with a sexist basis, I don't think that criminalising those sorts of things will deal with the problem that we have got at the heart of the Sarah Everard case,"" Raab said. ""Criminalising insulting language -- even if it's misogynistic -- does not deal with the intimidation, the violence and the much higher level of offence and damage and harm that we really ought to be laser-like focused in on,"" the former foreign secretary said. The government on Tuesday announced an independent inquiry into ""systematic failures"" in policing, after an officer serving in London was jailed for life for Everard's kidnap, rape and murder. The death of the 33-year-old marketing consultant rocked the country and led to an outcry over violence against women and girls in Britain.   Wayne Couzens, 48, who served in the Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection unit, falsely arrested Everard as she walked home from a friend's house, on the pretence that she had broken coronavirus restrictions in place at the time.

The committee was asked to submit its recommendations within 15 days, following which a decision had to be taken.   Until last year, the institute held the clerical recruitment exam only in English and Hindi. Earlier this year, questions were asked why IBPS was holding exams to recruit clerks in only Hindi and English when the Constitution of India recognised 22 languages. After several such demands, the Finance Ministry decided to put on hold the ongoing recruitment process in July and formed a committee to look into the demands and recommend measures to address the issue. In September, the Finance Ministry recommended that clerical recruitment for 12 Public Sector Banks should be conducted in 13 regional languages, apart from Hindi and English. It also clarified that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's statement in 2019 assuring that banking exams will be held in local languages was in the context of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) only."

""I would like to express to the victims my sadness, sorrow for the trauma they have suffered and also my shame, our shame, for the church's inability, for too long, to put them at the centre of its concerns,"" Francis said at his weekly general audience. Speaking a day after a major investigation revealed that French clergy had abused more than 200,000 children over 70 years, the pontiff invited Catholics in France to take responsibility for what had happened in order to make the Church a ""safe home for everyone"". ""This is the moment of shame,"" he said, calling on bishops to make every efforts to ensure that ""similar tragedies do not happen again"". Jean-Marc Sauve, head of the commission that compiled the report, said the Church had shown indifference towards the abuses for years, preferring to protect itself rather than the victims, many of them aged between 10 and 13. The height of the abuse was 1950-1970, the commission said in its report, with an apparent resurgence in cases in the early 1990s. The pontiff added that he was close to French priests dealing with a ""hard, yet healthy"" challenge. The Pope had already expressed his gratitude to victims for the courage they had in coming forward and denouncing what they had been through. Later on Wednesday, a Vatican court is expected to hand down a sentence to a man who is now a priest for alleged sexual abuse committed in a youth seminary in the Vatican before he was ordained.   The trial is the first in the Vatican concerning sexual abuse that allegedly occurred on Vatican territory.

With counting done in more than 97 percent of polling stations, Mussolini garnered more than 8,200 preference votes after standing for the hard-right Brothers of Italy party. The 47-year-old, who will be serving a second term as city councillor, insisted that her surname had nothing to do with her popularity. ""The person prevails over their surname, however burdensome it is,"" she told the La Repubblica newspaper, adding: ""I have many left-wing friends."" Mussolini's late father, Romano, was a jazz pianist and brother-in-law to actress Sophia Loren. He was Benito Mussolini's fourth child. Other descendants of the Italian dictator have gone into politics, all for the right, including Rachele's step-sister Alessandra, a former member of the European Parliament. Right-wing parties fared relatively badly in local elections in Italy on Sunday and Monday, losing mayoral races in key towns such as Milan, Naples and Bologna. In Rome, a run-off is due to take place on October 17-18 between right-wing candidate Enrico Michetti, a lawyer and radio host, and the centre-left's Roberto Gualtieri.   In the first round, Michetti won 30 percent versus 27 percent for Gualtieri, a former economy minister. Opinion polls suggest Gualtieri is favourite to win in two weeks' time.

The hearing in the matter was listed for Wednesday in Delhi High court before Justice Yogesh Khanna. The hearing was adjourned for October 8 as the concerned bench didn't assemble on Wednesday. The concerned bench is also examining the Abhishek Banerjee petition challenging several summonses to the couple by the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) in the matter. The petitioner is seeking the setting aside and quashing of the trial court orders dated 18.09.2021 and 30.09.2021 passed by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Patiala House District Court, issuing summons to the petitioner for her personal physical appearance in New Delhi. The plea states that ED complaint against her deserves to be set aside for being false, malicious and vexatious. A perusal of the record would show that the impugned prosecution is a vindictive abuse of the process of law by the Respondent (ED) and hence deserves to be quashed at the threshold. On September 30, 2021, Rujira Banerjee had appeared virtually citing personal reasons for travelling to Delhi before the Court. Lawyer court directed her to appear before it physically on October 12, 2021. The court had issued summons to her on a complaint of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) sought issuance of warrant against her for non-appearance before it. Appearing for ED, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had strongly opposed the petition filed by Abhishek Banerjee and Rujira Banerjee challenging ED Summons.

Sumit Jaiswal, a local BJP leader seen in a video leaving the SUV that allegedly crushed protesting farmers, claimed that the protesters attacked Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra's convoy, not the other way round. He has filed a case alleging that his driver, friend and two BJP workers were beaten to death and that he found out from social media later. In the FIR, filed three days after the incident, he says he was in the SUV with his friend Shubham and driver Hari Om when protesters attacked the car. The driver was injured and attacked with sticks and swords, he claims. This is the second FIR after a previous case filed by the families of the dead farmers against the Union Minister's son Ashish Mishra, accusing him of running over farmers. In the viral video, Sumit Jaiswal was seen running from the Thar SUV that drove into protesters from behind. The clip also shows a man crushed under the left rear wheel. Many initially believed Jaiswal was Ashish Mishra, and shared the video calling it proof that he was in the car, contrary to what he and his father have been claiming. ""Yes, I am that man in the video. We were under attack from farmers...I somehow got away alive,"" the BJP councillor said. Another video, unconfirmed so far, shows the Thar ramming the group of slogan-shouting protesters marching on the road with their backs to the convoy. But Jaiswal claimed the car was not moving, and it was the protesters that attacked the convoy. ""We were at the programme venue. There was an atmosphere of fear. They were armed with sticks and rocks and they kept attacking us, abusing us,"" he said. They also shouted ""Khalistan Zindabad. They climbed the car,"" Jaiswal said. According to him, that is when they stopped the car and ran out. ""In the video that you see (car running over protesters), the car was stationary and the protesters were constantly attacking us. How can we drive through the crowd? I was lucky to survive...It was terrifying. BJP workers were beaten to death,"" he said.   ""Those you are calling farmers were actually troublemakers and attacking us"". When he was asked about the visuals of a man crushed under the SUV - suggesting that the car did, in fact, run over several people - Jaiswal replied: ""I was in a hurry to save my life. I didn't notice any such man."""

Why are political leaders being stopped? The people are watching the actions. The government should act fast to bring the culprits under law,"" he said. ""On one side, the government is celebrating 75 years of Independence, and on the other side, political leaders are being stopped from visiting Lakhimpur Kheri. What's the reason behind it?

This year, between July and September, Delhi's peak power demand was 53 per cent higher in comparison with the corresponding days of 2020 and 34 per cent more than 2019, discom officials said. The process to resume economic activities that were shut down due to the second wave of COVID 19, began in Delhi by the end of May, allowing manufacturing and construction work with certain guidelines. In the following days, transport facilities, shops, markets, offices and other such activities were restarted in a phased manner by Delhi government in view of the impact of the Covid-induced lockdown on economy. Apart from the unlocking and resumption of economic activities, weather also has had a profound impact on the city's power demand, they said. Analysing on a monthly basis, Delhi's peak power demand was 70 per cent higher than on corresponding days in 2020. On the other hand, on account of the rainy season, the peak power demand in September 2021 has been lower than that of September 2020 on most corresponding days, officials said. Earlier on July 2 this year, Delhi's peak power demand had clocked this season's highest at 7,323 MW. In fact, this was only the third year in Delhi's power history that the peak power demand crossed 7,000 MW, they said. In 2018, the peak power demand had crossed the 7,000 MW for the first time, clocking 7,016 MW. In 2019, it reached 7,409 MW. In 2020, Delhi's season's highest peak power demand had only clocked 6,314 MW. The peak power demand in August 2021 was 14 per cent more than the peak power demand of August 2020 and 1.18 percent more than the peak power demand of August 2019, they added. The BSES discoms are fully geared-up and sourcing adequate electricity to meet the power demand to serve over 4.5 million consumers and 18 million residents in South, West, East and Central Delhi, including essential services such as hospitals, labs, quarantine centres, vaccination centres, said a spokesperson of the discom.   Apart from a robust distribution network and accurate load-forecasting, BSES discoms have also made proper arrangement, including long-term power purchase agreements and banking to meet the electricity demands of Delhi, he added.

In a four-page letter sent on Tuesday, the chief minister alleged that the floods were ""man-made"" and caused by ""uncontrolled and unplanned"" discharge of water from DVC dams in Jharkhand's Panchet and Maithon. Referring to an earlier letter she had written on August 4 in this connection, Mamata Banerjee said, ""I had highlighted the structural factors that give birth to grave man-made flood situation in southern Bengal, repeatedly, pitifully and tragically. Unless the Government of India addresses the basic underlying structural and managerial issues, both on a short term and on a long-term basis, the disasters will continue unmitigated in our lower riparian state."" The Trinamool chief said she hasn't received any reply to her previous letter. ""The issues that I raised affect millions of lives, and I request that the Government of India should get into some serious actions without further delay,"" the letter read. Mamata Banerjee also alleged that the DVC authorities did not pay heed to IMD warnings of heavy rainfall, and ""kept the water discharge from the dams at a low level and when there was heavy rainfall, it discharged about 10 lakh acre-feet of water between September 30 and October 2, which caused serious devastation in lower Damodar region before the festive season"". She has also given a date-wise list of water discharged from Maithon and Panchet dams. ""This annual problem requires immediate short-term and long-term measures so that the sufferings of the people are mitigated and the national loss in terms of loss of life and property is avoided."" ""I seek your kind immediate intervention so that the Ministry concerned of the Government of India is requested to engage with the Governments of West Bengal and Jharkhand and the authorities of the DVC, to help in arriving at a permanent solution to this problem of our state occurring year after year,"" she said. Incidentally, parts of south Bengal were flooded in early August, and Mamata Banerjee had alleged that the ""man-made"" disaster was caused due to excessive release of water by the DVC, claiming 16 lives and affecting lakhs of farmers. Last week, Ms Banerjee had held the Jharkhand government and the DVC responsible for the current flood situation in the southern part of West Bengal. She contended that it was caused due to unplanned and enhanced discharge of water from dams and barrages in Jharkhand without prior information to her administration.   Mamata Banerjee claimed that the reservoirs in Jharkhand have not been cleaned for the last 50 years, and warned of ""massive protests"" if dredging of dams and barrages was not done on an urgent basis to prevent the recurring floods.

US Democratic and Republican senators urged President Joe Biden on Tuesday to expel Russian diplomats if Moscow did not issue more visas for Americans to represent Washington in Russia. ""Those proposing such steps are apparently pushing for the closure of U.S. foreign institutions in Russia,"" Russia's foreign ministry said, the Interfax news agency reported. ""They must understand that the blame for this will lie with them,"" the ministry said late on Tuesday. It said that Moscow did not have that number of diplomats in Washington and that the proposal appeared to include diplomatic staff at Russia's mission at the United Nations. The U.S. proposal by the leaders of the Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees would mark an escalation in long-running tensions between Moscow and Washington over the number of diplomats they have in one another's countries.   Russia in August banned the U.S. embassy in Moscow from retaining, hiring or contracting Russian or third-country staff, except for guards, forcing the mission to let go 182 employees and dozens of contractors, the State Department said.

Kelly's channels from its video platform, distancing itself from the singer who was convicted of sex trafficking last month. R. Kelly was convicted by a federal jury in September in his sex trafficking trial, where prosecutors accused the singer of exploiting his stardom over a quarter-century to lure women and underage girls into his orbit for sex. Two of his channels, RKellyTV and RKellyVevo, have been removed from one of the world's largest video platforms and the singer will no longer be able to create or own any other YouTube channel, YouTube said in a statement sent late on Monday, following Reuters' request for comment. The catalog of his music will however be available on YouTube Music, YouTube's audio-streaming service, and the videos uploaded by other YouTube users will continue to be available. ""We can confirm that we have terminated two channels linked to R. Kelly in accordance with our creator responsibility guidelines,"" a YouTube spokesperson told Reuters in a statement. The MuteRKelly campaign, founded by two Black women in 2017 to try to remove the singer's music from the air waves, said on Twitter, ""Waiting on you @youtubemusic, and you too @Spotify @AppleMusic @AmazonMusic, etc."" Contacted outside of regular U.S. business hours, Spotify, Apple and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters seeking comment on whether they would be taking similar action over R Kelly's music available on their platforms. Kelly's music has largely disappeared from radio but is still available on streaming platforms. His hit record ""I Believe I Can Fly"" was for years a popular choice at graduation ceremonies. Kelly faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years behind bars, and could face up to life in prison at his May 4, 2022, sentencing.   The singer, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is one of the most prominent people tried on sex charges during the #MeToo movement, which amplified accusations that had dogged him since the early 2000s.

A bench of Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna said the top court is not averse to celebration but not at the cost of life of other citizens. Celebration does not mean use of loud crackers, it can also be with ""Fuljhaddi"" (sparkles) and the like which are not noisy, it said. ""Our earlier order must be complied with by every state. Despite the fact that there is a specific ban on joint crackers, if you go to any state or city or any celebration, joint crackers are openly available in the market. ""Our order must be complied with. It is not the question whether one content or the other. It is being sold openly in the market and used by people. We would like to know if a ban is there, how come they are available in markets,"" the bench said. As the hearing commenced, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for petitioner Arjun Gopal, submitted that they have filed an additional affidavit on the basis of the CBI report and what has transpired is indeed very disturbing. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for manufacturers' association of firecrackers, contended that the industry should work as per the protocol issued by the government. ""It is an organised industry. Around five lakh families depend on us. So far Sivakasi is concerned, we are taking all the precautions,"" Mr Dave said. The Supreme Court said the main difficulty is about implementation of the orders issued by it. ""Have you seen the reply by the manufacturers. What they say is very surprising. They say that when they are found to have purchased a huge quantity of barium salt, it is to be kept in godown but not to be used for manufacture. It's not for show that they are keeping it godown,"" the bench said. Senior advocate Rajiv Dutta said if one or two manufacturers are violating the orders the whole industry should not suffer. The top court asked the parties to exchange copies of counter affidavits filed in response to the CBI report and posted the matter for hearing on October 26 The Supreme Court had earlier said the CBI report on use of toxic chemicals in manufacturing of firecrackers is very serious and ""prima facie"" it appears that there has been violation of the court's orders on use of barium and labelling of fireworks. It had noted that manufacturers such as Hindustan Fireworks and Standard Fireworks purchased barium in huge quantities and used these chemicals in the fireworks. The Supreme Court had on March 3, 2020 directed the Joint Director, CBI at Chennai to make a detailed investigation and submit report within six weeks on the alleged violation of the court's earlier orders by the manufacturers by using the ingredients which have been banned and mislabeling their products contrary to the directions of this court. It had taken a stern view of the issue when senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan stated that these manufacturers were openly flouting the court's order. The Supreme Court had ordered six manufacturers to show cause why they should not be punished for contempt of its orders. The Supreme Court had said it cannot infringe the right to life of other citizens under the guise of employment while considering a ban on firecrackers and its prime focus is the right to life of innocent citizens. The Supreme Court had earlier refused to impose complete ban on sale of firecrackers and said that sale can happen through only licensed traders and that only green crackers can be sold. Online sale of firecrackers has been completely banned.   The verdict had come in response to a plea seeking a ban on manufacturing and sale of firecrackers across the country to curb air pollution.

Taliban officials have said the service will resume from Saturday, after being suspended since their takeover and the fall of the previous government in August, which stranded many of those desperate to flee the country. ""I have come to get a passport but, as you can see here, there are lots of problems, the system is not working,"" one applicant, Mahir Rasooli, told Reuters outside the office. ""There is no official to answer our questions here to tell us when to come. People are confused."" A spokesman for the Taliban officials running the passport department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Poverty and hunger have worsened since the Islamist movement took over Afghanistan, which already suffered from drought and the COVID-19 pandemic. Half a million people have been displaced in recent months, the United Nations says, and the number will only grow if health services, schools and the economy break down. The hundreds who descended on the passport office came despite advice that distribution of passports would only begin on Saturday, and initially only for those who had already applied. The crowd pressed against a large concrete barrier, trying to hand documents to an official who stood atop it, in a scene reminiscent of the chaos at Kabul airport in the last stages of evacuation after the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The official urged them to return home and come back on Saturday. ""I am here to receive a passport, but unfortunately I couldn't,"" said a man in the crowd, Ahmad Shakib Sidiqi. ""I don't know what we should do in this condition."" The bleak economic outlook drives their desire to leave, said Sidiqi and Rasooli. ""There is no job and the economic situation is not too good, so I want to have a good future for my kids,"" said Rasooli. Sidiqi said he wanted a passport to accompany a member of his family to neighbouring Pakistan to seek medical treatment, but added they had no choice except to leave. ""We have to leave Afghanistan,"" he said. ""It is a bad situation in Afghanistan - no job, no work. It is not a good condition for us to live.""   The Taliban have said they welcome international aid, though many donors froze their assistance after they took power.

According to a report in Dawn, an IHC larger bench, comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Amer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, on Tuesday took up a petition filed by the law ministry seeking a lawyer for the Indian spy. However, no progress has been made on the review issue as India refused to appoint a local lawyer while demanding Pakistan to let an Indian lawyer represent Mr Jadhav in the court. Kulbhushan Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, was arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan, according to Pakistan authority. He was sentenced to death by Pakistan military court in 2017. India has rejected Pakistan's allegations and said he was kidnapped from the Iranian port of Chabahar. In early 2017, a Pakistani military court sentenced him to death. During Tuesday's hearing, the attorney general Khalid Jawed Khan showed the court correspondence between Pakistan and India for providing counsel to Mr Jadhav in order to comply with the verdict in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). He said the Indian government did not respond and argued that the federal government had filed the petition seeking the appointment of a lawyer so that the verdict of the military court could be revisited at an appropriate forum. The ICJ has ruled that Pakistan was in breach of its international obligations because of the failure to provide consular access to Mr Jadhav. In June, the Pakistan National Assembly had adopted the Bill to give the right of appeal to Indian prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav in regard to the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) ruling.   In 2020, the Pakistan government presented an ordinance in the National Assembly The 'International Court of Justice Review and Reconsideration Ordinance 2020'. India has said Pakistan must take appropriate steps to address the shortcomings of the bill."

The law, which came into effect late on Tuesday, bans online games involving betting and wagering, and ""any act or risking money, or otherwise on the unknown result of an event including on a game of skill"". The latest ban has intensified concerns that growing state regulations could hit the nascent but booming gaming sector in India, where foreign investors have pumped in millions of dollars in recent months. On Wednesday morning, MPL's gaming app showed messages to users in Karnataka that said: ""Sorry! The law in your state does not permit you to play Fantasy sports"", ""Fantasy games are locked"" and ""cash games are locked"". The gaming app offers fantasy cricket and football games and allows real-money wagering on them. Dream11, one of India's most popular gaming apps backed by Tiger Global, was still operational, but Paytm First Games was not. Dream11 declined to comment, while MPL and Paytm did not immediately respond. Karnataka, home to some of the world's biggest tech companies and India's tech capital Bengaluru, is the latest state that has banned such online games after Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Tamil Nadu had also imposed such bans, but its bill was struck down by its high court. An industry source had told Reuters earlier that these states were important for the gaming business and account for roughly 20% of the total business for companies. Roland Landers, the chief executive of the All India Gaming Federation, said ""the industry will challenge this in court and seek legal recourse"". Two other industry sources told Reuters on Wednesday that gamers and some companies were planning to file court challenges against the new Karnataka law.   The law imposes hefty fines and prison terms on violaters and has been implemented amid growing concerns that online gaming platforms, like gambling, are addictive and can cause financial harm.

There is no pressure on us, We will investigate this, and those involved, who conspired, will take action against them,"" he had said.

""As far as the vehicle is concerned, I was clear that my driver was killed, two workers were killed. One worker escaped, three workers are injured, and after that, the car stopped there. After that, the car was pushed and the vehicle and another Fortuner were burnt. Such people can't be farmers. These are extremists hidden amongst farmers,"" he said.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), on Tuesday, said that climate change increases the global risk of water-related hazards like floods and droughts, and the number of people affected by water scarcity is also expected to soar. ""According to figures cited in the report, 3.6 billion people had inadequate access to water at least one month per year in 2018. By 2050, this is expected to rise to more than five billion,"" the report titled ""The State of Climate Services 2021: Water"" said. It further highlighted the need for urgent action to improve cooperative water management, embrace integrated water and climate policies and scale up investment in this precious commodity which underpins all the international goals on sustainable development, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. ""Increasing temperatures are resulting in global and regional precipitation changes, leading to shifts in rainfall patterns and agricultural seasons, with a major impact on food security and human health and well-being,"" said World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. In the past 20 years, terrestrial water storage - the summation of all water on the land surface and in the subsurface, including soil moisture, snow and ice - has dropped at a rate of 1cm per year. According to the report, the biggest losses are occurring in Antarctica and Greenland, but many highly populated lower latitude locations are experiencing significant water losses in areas that are traditionally providing water supply, with major ramifications for water security. The situation is worsening by the fact that only 0.5 per cent of water on Earth is useable and available freshwater. Water-related hazards have increased in frequency over the past 20 years. Since 2000, flood-related disasters have risen by 134 per cent compared with the two previous decades. Most of the flood-related deaths and economic losses were recorded in Asia, where end-to-end warning systems for riverine floods require strengthening.   The number and duration of droughts also increased by 29 per cent over this same period. Most drought-related deaths occurred in Africa, indicating a need for stronger end-to-end warning systems for drought in that region, the report added.

The victims were identified as Sushila (36), her daughter Mansi (7) and her son Mohan (7), they said. Fire officials said two fire tenders were deployed to douse the blaze. The incident took place on Tuesday morning when Sushila's eldest daughter Mehak (13) was cooking food for her mother and three siblings, who were asleep. A fire broke out due to leakage in the rubber pipe of the gas cylinder, the police said. After the fire broke out, Mehak ran out of the family's rented accommodation, screaming for help. Sushila woke up and tried to get out with her other three children but could not as her saree caught fire, they said. After receiving information about the fire, police personnel reached the spot and rushed the injured to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital in a PCR van, Deputy Commissioner of Police (central) Shweta Chauhan said. Sushila, Mansi and Mohan succumbed to their injuries during treatment. Sushila's third daughter Monika (9) is undergoing treatment at RML Hospital, the police said. Although the cylinder did not explode, the fire spread rapidly due to the gas leakage, they said. Due to the narrow streets in the area, the ambulance and fire tenders faced difficulty in reaching the spot, they said. Sushila's husband, Rakesh, who works at a flour mill in Lawrence Road and was not home at the time of the incident, said his neighbours informed him about the fire. ""When I got back, I saw my daughter Mehak sitting outside and crying. I wanted to save my family but it was very late. My neighbours said that Sushila could not come out as she tried to save the three children,"" he said.   Police said the bodies were handed over to the family after a post-mortem examination.

It's one of the most popular and widely celebrated festivals in many parts of India, especially Gujarat. The celebrations are special in this state. Devotees worship the nine forms of Goddess Durga, who destroyed the demon, Mahishasura. They observe fast, perform puja and dress according to specific colours associated with each of the nine days. This year, Navaratri starts on October 7. The festival is dedicated to feminine divinity, referred to as Shakti. Special pujas are held for Goddess Shakti, and devotees religiously perform aarti every evening. An earthen pot, called garbi, is used for the aarti. A highlight of the festival in Gujarat is garba, a dance form with origins in the Saurashtra and Kutch regions of the state. Garba is performed around a centrally lit lamp or a picture or idol of Shakti. In modern times, the dance form has evolved and mega gatherings are organised where thousands of people participate. The state comes alive at night, with people dressed in colourful attire heading to various garba venues to swing to the beats. People usually do garba in traditional attire and it is sometimes accompanied by dandiya, a dance performed with two small wooden sticks. This year, like 2020, the celebrations are likely to be muted again due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Gujarat government has allowed garba in housing societies and private events but has urged people to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour. The crowd limit for Navratri celebrations has been capped at 400 people and no big garba events will be allowed this time.  "

There were 380 incursions in the southwest corner of Taiwan's ADIZ, Taiwan News reported. Since mid-September of last year, Beijing has stepped up its grey-zone tactics by regularly sending planes into Taiwan's ADIZ, with most instances occurring in the southwest corner of the zone and usually consisting of one to three slow-flying turboprop planes. Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades. Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by Beijing. China has threatened that ""Taiwan's independence"" means war.

""Farmers are being mowed down by a jeep, they are being murdered, and the name of a union minister and his son is coming up in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. Yesterday, PM visited Lucknow but he did not visit Lakhimpur Kheri. It is a systematic attack on farmers,"" said Rahul Gandhi fronting a press conference ahead of his visit. PM Modi, who was in Lucknow to inaugurate Azadi@75 conference, steered clear of the controversy. An SUV, allegedly driven by a Union Minister's son, ran over slogan-shouting farmers protesting the visit of the Minister in Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday. Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the incident. ""There used to be democracy, there is dictatorship in India now. Politicians cannot go to Uttar Pradesh.

The ministry has invited suggestions from states, union territories and all people concerned on the proposed amendments to the Act, within the next 15 days. ""Development of infrastructure along the international border areas is crucial for keeping our borders intact and to uphold the sovereignty of the country. ""Given the present scenario of obtaining approval for non-forestry use of forest land, many a times, strategic and security projects of national importance get delayed resulting in setback to development of such infrastructure at critical locations,"" the ministry noted while proposing to exempt such projects from obtaining prior approval of the central government under the Act. It also proposed to allow the states to permit non-forest use of forest land for implementation of such strategic and security projects that are to be completed in a given time frame. The ministry also plans to exempt from prior government approval the lands which were acquired before 1980, when the FCA first came into existence, noting that it has caused resentment in public sector bodies, including railways and public works department (PWD). ""There is a strong resentment in the Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Road, Transport & Highways, etc. for interpretation of the scope of applicability of the Act over the right of way (RoW) of railways, highways, etc. ""In most cases, these RoWs are claimed to have been formally acquired by these developmental organisations long before 1980, with a specific purpose to construct / establish rail line and roads. Part of the land was used for the purpose it was acquired before 1980 and the remaining part of the acquired land was left as such for future constructions/expansions,"" the ministry noted. It said that trees or forest existing on the leftover acquired land were, thus, left as such (prior to 1980) and further the blank areas were planted under different government schemes. ""With the enactment of the Act and further clarification on its scope of applicability by the Supreme Court, all such land requires prior approval of the central government for the non-forestry use. ""Thus, a landholding agency (Rail, NHAI, PWD, etc) is required to take approval under the Act as well as pay stipulated compensatory levies such as Net Present Value (NPV), Compensatory Afforestation (CA), etc. for use of such land which was originally been acquired for non-forest purposes. Ministry is considering now to exempt such lands acquired before October 25, 1980 from the purview of the Act,"" the ministry said. Under the FCA, central government approval is mandatory before any state or UT order on diversion, de-reservation and assignment of lease of any forest land or use of forest land for non-forest activities. Noting that there have been several violations of the provisions of the Act, the ministry said it will make the punishment more stringent to discourage offences under the law. It proposed that the offences will be cognisable and non-bailable, and will entail a simple imprisonment for a period which may extend to one year. The document also proposes removing zoos, safaris, forest training infrastructures from the definition of ""non-forestry"" activities.   ""It is understood that activities which are ancillary to conservation of forests and wildlife should not be considered as non-forestry activities. Accordingly, it has been proposed that, establishment of zoos, safaris, forest training infrastructures, etc. should not come within the meaning of ""non-forestry activity"" for the purpose of Section 2(ii) of the Act,"" it said.

Ms Gandhi Vadra was arrested Monday while on her way to Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri to visit the families of farmers killed in Sunday's violence. She had alleged she is being illegally held at a police compound in Sitapur (around 50 km from Lakhimpur Kheri). Mr Vadra said it was ""totally shocking that as a husband I can't even go and support my wife"".  ""Thankfully she has huge support of the masses... But for me, my family and my wife comes first.

259,Wed Oct 06 04:47:40 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: Ambitious Ethanol Plan Sparks Food Security Fears In India https://t.co/ZivvDRKtDW https://t.co/wWJGkwJPwD,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ambitious-ethanol-plan-sparks-food-security-fears-in-india-2565382,Ambitious Ethanol Plan Sparks Food Security Fears In India,"India's ambitious plan to cut the use of fossil fuels by promoting ethanol derived from rice, corn and sugar is drawing criticism from some experts who warn the move could undermine food security in the world's second-most populous country. In June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration accelerated the nation's ethanol goal by five years, seeking to double production and to have gasoline 20% blended with the spirit by 2025. To help meet the target, the government is offering financial assistance to biofuel producers and faster environmental clearances. The plan is also resulting in the diversion of food grains meant for the poor to companies at subsidized rates. Even as many developed countries debate limiting policy support for grain-based biofuels amid reports of food-price increases and greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, India is seeing multifold benefits. The government argues that the new target will help the world's third-largest oil consumer save 300 billion rupees ($4 billion) annually by cutting crude imports, reduce carbon emissions and boost farmers' incomes. But critics say it's a self-goal for a country that's struggled for years to feed its poor. Though the Green Revolution helped boost farm yields and turn India into a net exporter of wheat and rice, it still ranks 94th on the Global Hunger Index 2020 comprising 107 nations. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that about 209 million Indians, or about 15% of its population, were undernourished between 2018 and 2020. The coronavirus pandemic is also pushing more people into poverty, dealing a blow to decades of progress. ""It will always be the poor who will be affected worse as a result of diverting precious food grains to alternative energy conversion,"" said Shanthu Shantharam, who helped formulate the country's biotechnology regulations in the 1990s and now teaches agricultural biotech at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. ""As it is, the food security situation in the country is precarious."" The report that maps out the new ethanol blending target primarily focuses on food-based feedstocks, with the government saying the program is a ""strategic requirement"" in light of grain surpluses and wide availability of technologies. Yet the blueprint is a departure from the 2018 National Policy on Biofuels, which prioritized grasses and algae; cellulosic material such as bagasse, farm and forestry residue; and, items like straw from rice, wheat and corn. ""India has a real opportunity here to become a global leader in sustainable biofuels policy if it chooses to refocus on ethanol made from wastes,"" said Stephanie Searle, fuels program director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. ""This would bring both strong climate and air quality benefits, since these wastes are currently often burned, contributing to smog."" Water Crisis The new ethanol policy should ensure that it doesn't drive farmers toward water-intensive crops and create a water crisis in a country where its shortage is already acute, said Ramya Natarajan, an energy researcher at the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, a think tank in Bengaluru. Rice and sugar cane, along with wheat, consume about 80% of India's irrigation water. ""With our depleting groundwater resources, arable land constraints, erratic monsoons, and dropping crop yields due to climate change, food production must be prioritized over crops for fuel,"" Natarajan said. A ton of corn can typically produce about 350 liters of ethanol, while a similar quantity of rice can yield about 450 liters of the spirit. For sugar cane, it's about 70 liters. Even in the U.S., food-versus-fuel fights have flared intermittently. Some say the domestic fossil-fuel industry's embrace of climate-friendly fuels has diverted corn and soy meal used to bulk up chickens and hogs, and made them more expensive. For instance, demand for soy oil has pushed futures up about 80% in the past 12 months, while the fast-food industry has complained of paying more for everyday items such as mayonnaise. These days, many developed countries are focusing more on electric vehicles to cut carbon emissions. The Biden administration's infrastructure proposal has set aside $174 billion of investments in EVs, including subsidies, but relatively little for biofuels. India, which is also seeking to promote EVs, shouldn't focus on both policies at the same time as they aren't complementary, said Kushankur Dey, chairman of the Centre for Food and Agribusiness Management at the Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow. The push for ethanol poses no threat to India's food security because the government has enough stockpiles of grains at warehouses of the state-run Food Corp. of India, said Sudhanshu Pandey, the top bureaucrat at the food ministry in New Delhi. ""The long-term planning of the government involves the creation of sufficient capacities so that half of the requirement of 20% blending is catered by grains, predominantly maize and the rest by sugar cane,"" Pandey said. State reserves stood at 21.8 million tons of rice as of Sept. 1, against a requirement of 13.54 million tons, according to the food ministry. The blending plan would benefit corn and rice farmers, while addressing the issue of surplus, Pandey said. Some critics are concerned that food grains meant for the impoverished are being sold to distilleries at prices cheaper than what states pay for their public distribution networks. Many ethanol producers are getting rice at 2,000 rupees per 100 kilograms (220 pounds), which compares with an estimated 4,300 rupees Food Corp. of India pays to stock up the grain.   ""Competition between the distilleries and the public distribution system for subsidized food grains could have adverse consequences for the rural poor and expose them to enhanced risk of hunger,"" said Prabhu Pingali, professor of applied economics and director of the Tata-Cornell Institute for Agriculture and Nutrition at Cornell University.

260,Wed Oct 06 04:47:35 +0000 2021,"RT @ndtvfeed: As India Faces Power Crunch, Potential Next Steps In Coal Crisis https://t.co/YzjH2ffTVo https://t.co/OfatIvm5Ky",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coal-shortage-coal-crisis-as-india-faces-power-crunch-potential-next-steps-in-coal-crisis-2565378,"As India Faces Power Crunch, Potential Next Steps In Coal Crisis","India is grappling with an escalating crisis as stockpiles of coal, the fuel used to generate about 70% of the nation's electricity, dwindle to the lowest in years just as power demand is set to surge. Coal-fired power stations have an average of four days' worth of stock of the fuel, according to the latest data, and more than half the plants are already on alert for outages. Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh has warned that the nation could be handling a supply squeeze for as long as six months. Power shortages are already emerging, and the gap between available electricity supply and peak demand widened to more than 4 gigawatts on Monday, according to government data from power ministry. While shortages of coal in China, and that nation's power crunch, have commanded most attention, it's India that's facing a potentially worsening scenario. Industrial and domestic consumption usually hits peak levels as India enters a festival season from later in October and that could risk stalling a rebound in Asia's third-biggest economy, which has been recovering from an unprecedented 7.3% contraction in the fiscal year ended in March. Here are some potential next steps and constraints in India's crisis: Mining Rebound State-run Coal India Ltd., the world's top producer of the fuel, is seeking to increase daily coal supply to 1.9 million tons by mid-October from about 1.7 million tons currently, an increase that would go a long way to help ease the deficit. Deliveries to power plants are currently short by between 60,000 and 80,000 tons a day, according to Anil Kumar Jain, India's coal secretary. Coal production has been hit by severe flooding in India's eastern and central states during the typical monsoon season, with mines and key logistics routes impacted. Any recovery will hinge on the weather -- rains need to stop to allow mines to ramp up operations and for coal trucks to resume deliveries. On Tuesday the government said it will allow companies that have been allotted coal and lignite mines for their own use to sell 50% of their annual output in a bid to ease shortages. While coal stockpiles at power plants are perilously low, it remains unlikely the operations will completely run out of fuel. Government ministries and industry are working to closely monitor stocks, and could move again to divert supplies away from industrial users -- like aluminum and cement makers -- to prioritize power generation. That'd leave those industries faced with their own dilemma: curb output, or pay high prices for imported coal. Supply Controls Rationing domestic power supplies, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, may emerge as one of India's easiest solutions -- though it'd pose other challenges for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Indian power distributors do typically cut supplies to certain areas on a rotational basis when generation is lower than demand, and an extension of load-shedding would likely be considered if power plants take any further hits. However, doing so would risk jeopardizing the country's fragile economic recovery and Modi's government is already facing criticism for failing to generate enough new jobs. Price Incentive Soaring power prices could potentially make it viable for some coastal plants to use high-cost imported coal, easing some of the burden on domestic miners. The country meets around three-quarters of power demand with locally-produced coal, and much of the rest is imported from countries including Indonesia, South Africa and Australia. Spot prices of power sold through the Indian Energy Exchange Ltd. jumped more than 63% year-on-year in September to average 4.4 rupees ($0.06) a kilowatt hour and were as high as 13.95 rupees on Wednesday, according to official data. That means some plants likely could now look to snap up prompt cargoes of seaborne coal, even with prices of the commodity at a record.New guidelines are being drafted to allow generation companies to sell surplus electricity on the exchanges, in part to spur idled plants back into action. Two giant plants in Gujarat state owned by Tata Power Co. and Adani Power Ltd. are among those that have been mothballed as a result of issues including high imported coal prices. Fuller Dams The same monsoon rains that have flooded coal mines are likely to boost hydro-power generation. Large hydro-electric projects on dams are India's major electricity source after coal and the sector performs at its peak around the rainy season which typically extends from June to October. Generation from the projects accounted for about 14% of India's total during the six months through Sept. 30, and that share could increase if the plants can operate at higher utilization rates. Recent data shows hydro-power generation is above target in a sign that companies are beginning to ramp up output. Turn to Gas There could be a larger role for natural gas to play, even with global prices currently surging. India has almost 25 gigawatts of gas-based generation capacity, though nearly 80% of that capacity remains unused because of high prices of the fuel. At current prices, imported LNG cargoes bought on the surging spot market aren't a solution for Indian power generators, according to Arun Kumar Singh, chairman of Bharat Petroleum Corp, India's second biggest fuel retailer which also buys and sells LNG. However, in a desperate situation the gas-powered fleet could help prevent any widespread power outages. State-run generator NTPC Ltd., for example, has idled capacity that could can be fired up in around 30 minutes if needed and is connected to a gas grid. Pricey Diesel   Any switch to oil products like fuel oil and diesel could be limited due to pollution curbs and prohibitively high prices. As it stands, the lack of large oil-fired plants directly connected to the grid means gas-to-fuel swaps are unlikely to take place on a grand scale. Some commercial establishments, including hospitals and malls, as well as small industries use diesel-based generators to ensure uninterrupted power supply in case of outages. But record high diesel prices in the country will prevent their widespread use."

Initially, it was thought that mobile phones would be used only to compensate for the physical gap between people by allowing them to communicate across thousands of kilometers. But as it evolved, it transformed not just how we communicate but also every aspect of human life – from banking to browsing. Similarly, the underlying technology for cryptocurrency is still evolving and not many are sure where it will lead to. However, one thing that appears certain is that the financial system will not be the same again. Some argue that cryptocurrency will negatively impact the global economy, particularly the developing ones, as it removes the need for intermediaries like banks. They primarily refer to its newness and lack of trust among a large part of users. They also cite the extreme volatility crypto coins show regularly and the lack of regulating authority. Others say the lack of regulation makes it democratic. They also argue cryptocurrency supports financial inclusion in poor countries at an unmatched rate because of increased transparency during transactions owing to its decentralised ledger system, low cost of the transaction, and its ability to beat inflation if someone decides to hold it as a store of value.   Irrespective of the arguments, El Salvador became the first country in the world in September 2021 to adopt Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, as a legal tender alongside the US dollar. It must have seen some merit in its usage. Also, many other countries are either developing or thinking of developing their own cryptocurrency, called the Central bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Corporates largely like cryptocurrency as it reduces regulatory oversight and helps them do business. Most users find it easy to transact and trade. But the real issue may arise with the transition.

Sunil Lahri, Arun Govil, Dipika Chikhlia Post Tributes","Veteran actor Arvind Trivedi, best known for portraying the role of Raavan in Ramanand Sagar's Ramayan, died at the age of 82. On social media, actors Arun Govil and Sunil Lahri confirmed the news of Arvind Trivedi's death and remembered their Ramayan co-star in heart-wrenching posts. Arun Govil, who played the role of Ram in the epic show, described Arvind Trivedi as ""my dear friend"" in his condolence tweet. Meanwhile, Sunil Lahri, who featured as Lakshman on Ramayan, wrote: ""Bahut dukhad samachar hai ki hamare sabke pyare Arvind bhai (Raavan of Ramayan) ab hamare bich nahin rahe. Bhagwan unki atma ko shanti de (It's very sad that our beloved Arvind Trivedi is not amongst us anymore. May he rest in peace). I am speechless I lost father figure my guide, well-wisher and gentleman."" Actress Dipika Chikhlia, who played the role of Sita in Ramayan, remembered Arvind Trivedi as: ""A very fine human being.""       Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned the Ramayan actor in a condolence tweet and said: ""We have lost Shri Arvind Trivedi, who was not only an exceptional actor but also was passionate about public service. For generations of Indians, he will be remembered for his work in the Ramayan TV serial. Condolences to the families and admirers of both actors. Om Shanti.""   Speaking to ETimes, Arvind Trivedi's nephew Kaustubh Trivedi said that the actor was suffering from age-related ailments and died of a heart-attack on Tuesday night: ""He was not keeping well for quite some time, but today he suffered a heart attack and that led to multi organ failure.'' As per reports, Arvind Trivedi's funeral is scheduled for Wednesday morning. Earlier this year, Arvind Trivedi was the subject of a death hoax when Sunil Lahri issued a clarification and said: ""By God's grace, Arvind ji is fine and I pray to God that he stays healthy.""   During the nationwide lockdown last year, Doordarshan brought back Ramanand Sagar's Ramayan on television, when it started airing twice a day. A video of Arvind Trivedi watching the Sita haran scene had gone crazy viral then. Ramayan, which first aired on Doordarshan in 1987 and gained instant popularity, made stars out of Arun Govil, Deepika Chikhlia and Sunil Lahri, known to fans as Lord Ram, Sita and Lakshman. Apart from his widely successful role in Ramayan, Arvind Trivedi also featured in almost 300 movies across Bollywood and Gujarati cinema. Arvind Trivedi also featured on the show Vikram Aur Betaal. He also starred in the widely popular movie Desh Re Joya Dada Pardesh Joya in Gujarati cinema."

In a letter written to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the Congress had said a five-member delegation led by Rahul Gandhi planned to visit the district. It also called the detention of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra ""without any reason or justification"". A delegation of Rahul Gandhi, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Channi, party leader KC Venugopal and Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot will reach state capital Lucknow around 1:30 pm. The permission for the visit was denied soon after with the state government citing orders banning large gatherings, news agency ANI reported. Ms Gandhi Vadra, a Congress general secretary, on Tuesday alleged that she was being held illegally at a police compound in Sitapur and no notice or FIR has been provided to her even after her 38-hour detention and was not allowed to meet her legal counsel. In a statement, she said she has not been produced in front of a magistrate or any other judicial officer and neither has she been allowed to meet her legal counsel, who has been standing at the gate of the compound since morning. ""Presently I am not going into the details of the completely illegal physical force used on my colleagues and me at the time of my arrest as this statement serves merely to clarify the continuing illegality of my confinement at the PAC compound in Sitapur, UP,"" she said. ""I have not been served with any order or notice. Nor have they shown me an FIR. I have not been produced in front of a magistrate or any other judicial officer either. I have also not been allowed to meet my legal counsel who has been standing at the gate since morning,"" the Congress leader also said. Ms Gandhi Vadra has been kept in detention since Monday morning after she wanted to meet the families of the victims of the Lakhimpur clashes. She said she has seen a portion of a paper on social media in which the authorities have named 11 people, including eight who were not even present at the time she was arrested. They have even named the two persons ""who brought my clothes from Lucknow on the afternoon of October 4"", she said.   Eight people were killed on Sunday as violence erupted during a farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri, claiming the lives of both farmers and BJP workers ahead of a visit by UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. Four of the dead were people in the cars, apparently part of a convoy of BJP workers who had come to welcome the UP minister and were attacked after allegedly running over the protesting farmers."

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told employees that the visionary co-founder would be eager to see what the company develops next. The comments in the internal memo, obtained by Bloomberg News, came alongside other efforts from the company Tuesday to commemorate the anniversary. Apple replaced its homepage with a tribute to Jobs and published a letter from Jobs's family. Cook also posted a video of Jobs on his Twitter account. Cook's full email to staff is here: Team, Today marks the 10th anniversary of Steve's passing. It's a moment to celebrate his life and to reflect on the extraordinary legacy he left behind. Steve believed that ""people with passion can change the world for the better."" That's the philosophy that inspired him to create Apple. And it lives in us today. Steve was so many things: brilliant, funny, and wise, a husband, a father, a friend, and, of course, a visionary. He challenged us to see the world not for what it was, but for what it could be. And he helped so many people, myself included, see the same potential in ourselves. Not a day goes by that I don't think about him. This year, as much as any other, we're reminded of the profound impact our products have on the world. I feel so lucky that we spend our days creating wildly innovative tools that connect people, inspire them to think differently, and empower them to make their own dent in the universe, too. It's one of the many gifts that Steve gave to all of us. I wish Steve were here to see the way his spirit lives on in all of your amazing work. But most of all, I wish he could see what you do next. Steve once said that his proudest achievements were the ones that were yet to come. He spent every day imagining a future that no one else could see and working relentlessly to bring his vision to life. Steve was a singular figure, but he taught us all how to soar. I miss him, and I will cherish him always. Tim   Jobs died in October 2011 at the age of 56, two months after stepping down as CEO and appointing Cook as his replacement.

From vast numbers of CCTV cameras to trials of lampposts kitted out with facial recognition tech, Singapore is seeing an explosion of tools to track its inhabitants. Officials have long pushed a vision of a hyper-efficient, tech-driven ""smart nation"", but activists say privacy is being sacrificed and people have little control over what happens to their data. Singapore is frequently criticised for curbing civil liberties and people are accustomed to tight controls, but there is still growing unease at intrusive tech. The government's latest surveillance devices are robots on wheels, with seven cameras, that issue warnings to the public and detect ""undesirable social behaviour"". This includes smoking in prohibited areas, improperly parking bicycles, and breaching coronavirus social-distancing rules. During a recent patrol, one of the ""Xavier"" robots wove its way through a housing estate and stopped in front of a group of elderly residents watching a chess match. ""Please keep one-metre distancing, please keep to five persons per group,"" a robotic voice blared out, as a camera on top of the machine trained its gaze on them. During a three-week trial in September, two robots were deployed to patrol the housing estate and a shopping centre. ""It reminds me of Robocop,"" said Frannie Teo, a 34-year-old research assistant, who was walking through the mall. It brings to mind a ""dystopian world of robots... I'm just a bit hesitant about that kind of concept"", she added. 'No constraints' Digital rights activist Lee Yi Ting said the devices were the latest way Singaporeans were being watched. ""It all contributes to the sense people... need to watch what they say and what they do in Singapore to a far greater extent than they would in other countries,"" she told AFP. But the government defended its use of robots, saying they were not being used to identify or take action against offenders during the tech's trial, and were needed to address a labour crunch as the population ages. ""The workforce is actually shrinking,"" said Ong Ka Hing, from the government agency that developed the Xavier robots, adding they could help reduce the number of officers needed for foot patrols. The island of about 5.5 million people has 90,000 police cameras, a number set to double by 2030, and facial recognition tech -- which helps authorities pick out faces in a crowd -- may be installed on lampposts across the city. There was a rare public backlash this year when authorities admitted coronavirus contract-tracing data collected by an official system had been accessed by police. The government later passed legislation to limit its use. But critics say the city-state's laws generally put few limitations on government surveillance, and Singaporeans have little control over what happens to the data collected.   ""There are no privacy law constraints on what the government can or cannot do,"" said Indulekshmi Rajeswari, a privacy lawyer from Singapore who is now based in Germany.

Dhaliwal, the beloved 42-year-old Harris County Sheriff's Deputy and a father of three, was gunned down during a traffic stop on September 27. Dhaliwal made national headlines in 2015 when he became the first police officer in Texas to serve while keeping his Sikh articles of faith, including a turban and beard. ""Our fallen brother Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal was honoured by renaming a postal office in west Harris County in his memory. We are grateful to the Texas delegation, Harris County Commissioners Court, United States Postal Office, & the Sikh community for honoring him,"" Harris County Sheriff's Office (HCSO) said in a tweet on Wednesday. Houston's Sikh community and local elected officials and members of law enforcement gathered on Tuesday at a ceremony at 315 Addicks-Howell Road to dedicate the ""Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office."" ""I am honoured to play a role in commemorating Deputy Dhaliwal's remarkable life of selfless service,"" said Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher, who brought the renaming legislation to the US House of Representatives. ""He represented the very best of our community: he worked for equality, connection, and community through his life of service to others. I was glad to work with a bipartisan delegation, our community partners, and those in the Sikh community, to pass legislation to rename this building the Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office,"" Fletcher said. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the ""remarkable commemoration"" serves as a permanent reminder of Dhaliwal's ""lasting contributions to our community"". ""This will serve as a permanent reminder of Deputy Dhaliwal's service, sacrifice, and example to us all. We are thankful to Congresswoman Fletcher and the entire Texas delegation for honouring a committed public servant who touched countless lives and served as a trailblazer. He was a true hero who inspired everyone to love their neighbours,"" Gonzalez said. According to the sheriff, Dhaliwal joined the agency as a detention officer in 2009 after feeling compelled to bridge the gap between law enforcement and the Sikh community. He later became a patrol deputy, leading the way for other Sikhs to serve with the Harris County Sheriff's Office. ""I'm thankful that visitors to the newly renamed post office will see his name and be encouraged to learn how special he was,"" said Commissioner Adrian Garcia, who originally hired Dhaliwal in his capacity as the previous sheriff of Harris County. ""Deputy Dhaliwal made the ultimate sacrifice to protect us, and he will never be forgotten. I am thankful to Representative Fletcher and the United States Postal Service for this important recognition.  Sandeep lived his life with the purpose to spread dignity and respect to all he came in contact with, and I am hopeful that the Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office will inspire all who visit to follow in Sandeep's example,"" Garcia said. Father of the slain police officer Pyara Singh Dhaliwal expressed gratitude to the people of Houston for their support. ""Since my son was taken from our family in a senseless act of violence, we have received an outpouring of support and love from the greater Houston community. We are so grateful and so honoured that Sandeep is being memorialised in this way-forever becoming a part of the city that he served faithfully both in and out of uniform,"" he said. US Postal Service District Director Julie Wilbert, however, said getting a post office renamed was not a common occasion and is reserved for a select group of individuals. ""To put it in its proper perspective, the postal service has over 31,000 retail and post offices. There are less than 900 that have been dedicated in honour of an individual,"" Wilbert said. Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund (SALDEF) Southwest Regional Director Bobby Singh said: ""Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal did not set out to be a trailblazer, he simply approached life with a caring heart, a generous spirit, and a warmth that brought people together."" ""Along with the many friends here today, our community has been forever changed by his death but this building will forever serve as a recognition of his life. He lived the true American-and Houstonian-life,"" he added. In the wake of Dhaliwal's death, Fletcher led the entire Houston delegation in introducing a resolution to honour the life and mourn the loss of the police officer and spoke on the House floor about his remarkable life and tragic death. In 2020, the Congresswoman's bill, H.R. 5317, the Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Act, was passed and signed into law by then US President Donald Trump. This isn't the first dedication for Deputy Dhaliwal. A year after his death, a portion of Beltway 8 near Highway 249 was renamed in his honour. Since 2015, Dhaliwal was the ""history-making"" police officer in Texas to serve while keeping his Sikh articles of faith. He was allowed to wear the turban and beard while patrolling the streets in order to bolster cultural diversity. With this policy, one of the largest sheriff's offices in the country had affirmed that a person does not have to choose between their faith and a career of service. Since 9/11, misperceptions about Sikhs' religiously-mandated turbans and beards have led an uptick to incidents of discrimination against the community. Policy changes like that at the Harris County Sheriff Office and other law enforcement agencies across the country aimed to combat this stigma while also giving qualified men and women a chance to serve the community.   Dhaliwal worked with United Sikhs, a global humanitarian relief and advocacy nonprofit, to help organise the donation of truckloads of supplies for first responders post-Harvey Hurricane that made landfall on Texas and Louisiana in August 2017.

Shrugging off panic-buying at petrol stations, bare supermarket shelves and retailers' warnings of a bleak Christmas to come, the Tory leader says the short-term pain is worth it. ""We are dealing with the biggest underlying issues of our economy and society,"" he is expected to say in his conference-closing speech, according to excerpts released by the party. ""The problems that no government has had the guts to tackle before. ""Because we are embarking now on the change of direction that has been long overdue in the UK economy,"" Johnson will say, vowing no return to the pre-Brexit model of ""uncontrolled immigration"". Instead, British businesses will have to invest in their workers and in technology to push the country ""towards a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy"". But it will take time to transition, and, in the meantime, the government has grudgingly agreed to a limited number of short-term visas to lure truckers and poultry workers from Eastern Europe. Climate silence The government blames the acute labour shortages afflicting the UK economy not on its hardline approach to Brexit but on the coronavirus pandemic. But the supply crisis risks undermining themes that Johnson is set to emphasise in his conference speech, including ""levelling up"" economic growth and ""Global Britain"" after the EU divorce. He is also expected to talk up Britain's action on climate change and the need for global coordination, ahead of convening the two-week COP26 climate summit in Scotland from October 31. Touring exhibitors' stands at the conference on Tuesday, Johnson rode an e-bike, climbed aboard an electric tractor, and played with a puzzle to assemble a zero-carbon energy house. But at the Tory gathering as a whole, the topic of climate change has been relegated to the backburner. Finance Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday it would be ""immoral"" to bequeath pandemic-driven debt to future generations, but made no mention of saving those generations from a burning planet. The omission was a ""damaging sign"" ahead of COP26 in Glasgow, commented Rebecca Newsom, head of policy for Greenpeace UK. ""Coughing up more cash for green infrastructure now would save enormous costs later and create millions of new jobs across the UK,"" she said. Neither did Foreign Secretary Liz Truss reference the C-word -- climate -- in her speech on Sunday, while vowing to support ""greener"" growth and ""clean infrastructure"" in developing countries. The B-word In contrast, the B-word -- Brexit -- has been a recurrent theme for delegates of Johnson's party, adamant that current problems associated with the EU split will pass. Brexit minister David Frost admonished the ""anti-transport, anti-car"" lobby's ""anti-growth ideologies"" and ""persistent miserabilism"". Interior Minister Priti Patel used her conference speech on Tuesday to promise tougher action against climate protestors who have been blockading roads around London. The prime minister mocked the demonstrators as ""irresponsible crusties"". But Johnson's COP26 president, Alok Sharma, denied the party was soft-pedalling climate change with less than a month to go before he welcomes delegates from around the world to Glasgow. ""Sometimes people don't perceive the Conservatives as leading on this,"" the former business minister told a small audience on the margins of the main conference in Manchester. ""Cabinet colleagues actually understand why it's vitally important to get this right,"" Sharma stressed.   ""This is a real, real opportunity to create jobs, to create growth, to have a healthier country, a healthier planet.""

Tensions have hit a new high between Taipei and Beijing, which claims the democratic island as its own territory, and Chinese military aircraft have repeatedly flown through Taiwan's air defence identification zone. Over a four day period beginning last Friday, Taiwan reported close to 150 Chinese air force aircraft entered its air defence zone, part of a pattern of what Taipei calls Beijing's continued harassment of the island. Asked by a lawmaker on the current military tensions with China at the parliament, Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said the situation was ""the most serious"" in more than 40 years since he joined the military, adding there was a risk of a ""misfire"" across the sensitive Taiwan Strait. ""For me as a military man, the urgency is right in front of me,"" he told a parliamentary committee reviewing a special military spending of T$240 billion ($8.6 billion) for home-made weapons including missiles and warships. China says Taiwan should be taken by force if necessary. Taiwan says it is an independent country and will defend its freedoms and democracy, blaming China for the tensions. Chiu said China already has the ability to invade Taiwan and it will be capable of mounting a ""full scale"" invasion by 2025. ""By 2025, China will bring the cost and attrition to its lowest. It has the capacity now, but it will not start a war easily, having to take many other things into consideration."" The United States, Taiwan's main military supplier, has confirmed its ""rock-solid"" commitment to Taiwan and also criticised China. Beijing blames Washington's policies of supporting Taiwan with arms sales and sending warships through the Taiwan Strait for raising tensions. Taiwan's special military spending over the next five years will go mostly toward naval weapons including anti-ship weapons such as land-based missile systems.   Taiwan reported one Chinese air force aircraft entered its air defence zone on Tuesday. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"
274,Wed Oct 06 02:50:17 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: US National Security Advisor To Meet China's Top Diplomat Amid High Tensions https://t.co/hGuz4pDAZC https://t.co/OUp2smwLDO,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-to-meet-chinas-top-diplomat-amid-high-tensions-2565289,US National Security Advisor To Meet China's Top Diplomat Amid High Tensions,"U.S. President Joe Biden's national security adviser will hold talks with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Switzerland on Wednesday, upholding a pledge by both countries to boost communication amid a deepening strategic rivalry. The Zurich meeting comes at a time of heightened tensions between the world's two largest economies over a range of issues including Taiwan. It will be U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan's first face-to-face meeting with Yang since their acrimonious exchanges in Alaska in March, which also involved U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The White House said in a statement that the meeting follows up on Biden's Sept. 9 call with Chinese President Xi Jinping ""as we continue to seek to responsibly manage the competition between the United States and the People's Republic of China."" That call ended a nearly seven-month gap in direct communication between the leaders, and they discussed the need to ensure that competition between the two - with relations sinking to their lowest level in decades - does not veer into conflict. In a brief statement on Wednesday, China's foreign ministry said Yang and Sullivan will ""exchange views on China-U.S. relations and relevant issues"" during their Zurich meeting. Blinken, currently visiting Paris, held a call with Yang in June, stressing the need for cooperation and transparency over the origins of COVID-19 and raised other contentious topics, including China's treatment of Uyghur Muslims, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper quoted an official familiar with the arrangements for the Zurich meeting as saying the objective is ""to rebuild communication channels and implement consensus reached"" between Xi and Biden. With trade tensions also at the top of the U.S.-China agenda, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, in Paris for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development meetings, has said she hopes to hold discussions soon with Chinese counterparts. On Monday, Tai unveiled the results of a months-long ""top-to-bottom"" review of China trade policy, pledging to hold ""frank"" talks with Beijing about its failure to keep promises made in former President Donald Trump's trade deal and end harmful industrial policies. The Global Times, a Chinese state-run tabloid, said China is willing to build mutually beneficial trade with the United States but will not make concessions on principle and is not afraid of a drawn-out contest. ""The China-U.S. trade war has lasted for more than three-and-a-half years. Instead of being weakened, China's economy has taken a step forward in comparison with the scale of the U.S.,"" it said. Little Progress Talks between officials from the two powers since Biden took office in January have shown little concrete progress. U.S. officials said the Biden-Xi call was a test of whether direct top-level engagement could end a stalemate in ties. After that call, Biden denied a media report that Xi turned down an offer from Biden for a first face-to-face meeting as leaders. Since then, the United States has taken a series of steps to strengthen its hand against China in coordination with allies. These have included the announcement of a trilateral partnership with Britain and Australia, called AUKUS, to provide the latter with nuclear-powered submarines. Biden hosted a first in-person summit with Australia, India and Japan in which the ""Quad"" leaders vowed to pursue a free and open Indo-Pacific region ""undaunted by coercion."" The White House said Sullivan will also visit Brussels for meetings with NATO and European Union officials, as well as Paris, and will brief the Europeans on his meeting with Yang. It said that at NATO he will discuss implementation of a decision at the June NATO summit to modernize the alliance and strategic challenges, and he will talk with EU officials about trade, technology and global economic issues. Biden's administration is also pursuing a massive domestic spending proposal aimed at rebuilding domestic infrastructure and industry, in part to boost U.S. competitiveness with China. ""It's not a thaw. It's not a re-embrace of engagement,"" Evan Medeiros, an Asia specialist during former President Barack Obama's administration, said of the Zurich meeting. ""It's about getting serious and systematic about competition. That means being very clear about boundaries, our perceptions of their behavior, particularly the recent number of air force strike packages around Taiwan."" China has blamed the United States for increased tensions over the democratically governed island claimed by Beijing, even as it has conducted an unprecedented number of incursions by its air force into Taiwan's air defense zone. Analysts said increased communication between senior U.S. and Chinese officials could allow progress in some aspects of ties, for example, letting more journalists return to each other's countries and reopening shuttered consulates in Houston and Chengdu. The month-end G20 summit in Italy has been talked about as a possible venue for a face-to-face Biden-Xi meeting.   ""I think the hope is that it will lead to a Biden-Xi Jinping meeting, which may have to be virtual,"" said Asia expert Bonnie Glaser of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

Delivering the prestigious ""King Gandhi Lecture"" at the Howard University here, India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said the edifice of India-US relation is built on the values of democracy, liberty, freedom, non-violence, and rule of law. ""The threads that connect India and the United States run deep and strong. The values of democracy, liberty, freedom, non-violence, and rule of law, that we cherish and nourish, form the strong foundation, on which the edifice of India-US relations is built,"" Mr Sandhu said in his address to the students of private, federally chartered historically black research university. Even before India gained independence, many of the leading lights of its freedom struggle, including Lala Lajpat Rai, Sarojini Naidu, Rabindranath Tagore, BR Ambedkar among others, had visited several universities in the US, including Howard, Mr Sandhu said. ""We shared and shaped each other's vision. You and I owe our allegiance to our respective Constitutions, which both start with, 'We the People...'' he said. Dr Martin Luther King Jr. had delivered the ''Gandhi Memorial Lecture"" at Howard University in 1963 and 1966. Dr. William Stuart Nelson, dean of the School of Religion and vice president for special projects at Howard University established Gandhi Memorial Lecture in 1958. He was an exponent of the philosophy of nonviolence, who had been a friend of both Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He had walked with both in protest marches. In his address, Mr Sandhu noted that the story of Howard was closely tied to America's history; recalled how leaders from India and the US influenced the thoughts of each other and the impact it had in shaping the history of both countries. The Ambassador also highlighted the concept of trusteeship, principle of non-violence, devotion to truth and journeys as key aspects of Mahatma Gandhi's work. In his address Mr Sandhu underlined how Mahatma Gandhi's principles have shaped India's vision for development and prosperity. ""The pandemic has once again taught us, how interconnected we are, how intertwined, our lives are. 'World is one'' is not just a hashtag, but a reality today. Our future will depend on, how we treat each other, and work with each other today,"" he said. ""As the largest and oldest democracies with pluralistic societies, India and the US continue to strive, to make the lives of our citizens better, and brighter, each day. While doing so, we also strive towards shaping a world which is healthier, and happier,"" Mr Sandhu said. ""If you ask me, what is the most significant contribution of Gandhi ji and MLK, I would say: They showed to the world, that mankind can shape its own destiny, no matter how high, the odds are, no matter how huge, the challenges are, no matter how adverse, the circumstances are. It is a very powerful message, and gives unflinching hope to humanity at large."" ""They also proved that ordinary men and women are capable of achieving extraordinary feat through sheer grit and determination. And the journey starts with a small step: an urge to think beyond self,"" Mr Sandhu said in his address. India and Howard University are connected through visionary leader Howard Thurman, who visited India in 1935 on 'pilgrimage' and met Mahatma Gandhi, and whose ideas influenced and shaped a generation of leaders including Martin Luther King Jr. Thurman was a dean of Rankin Chapel at Howard University from 1932 to 1944. Prior to Thurman's visit to India, Mahatma Gandhi's disciple Mira ben had visited Howard University. Towards the end of 1936, Benjamin Mays - a friend of Martin Luther King's father and the dean of Howard University's School of Religion - also met with Mahatma Gandhi. Former President of Howard University, Mordecai Johnson, had long urged his students to follow Mahatma Gandhi's example. Mr Johnson's lectures influenced Martin Luther King. Howard University is holding a year of celebration of India in 2021-22. Several initiatives, including the Art of Kolam; visit of students to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial and interaction with the Embassy of India have been undertaken and others are in the pipeline. The Indian Embassy here has regular outreach to African American community; Congressional Black Caucus; and institutions such as Howard University in the past 18 months. As part of his outreach, Mr Sandhu has spoken to all senior members of the Congressional Black Caucus as well as Vice Chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and others. The embassy has also engaged with Freshman members of the Black Caucus. Mr Sandhu also visited the King Center in Atlanta in July 2021 where he also met with senior members of the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a co-pastor.   There was strong support from Congressional Black Caucus for India during the Covid surge earlier this year. The Caucus also advocated for the TRIPS waiver proposed by India and South Africa in the WTO.

Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the incident on Sunday. The video, being shared widely on social media, is yet to be verified by the police. NDTV cannot independently verify its authenticity. It is also not clear from the visuals who is in the driving seat. Earlier today, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted the viral clip with a pointed question for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""@narendramodi Sir, your government has kept me in custody for the last 28 hours without any order and FIR. This person who crushed the annadata (farmers) has not been arrested yet. Why?"" tweeted Priyanka Gandhi this morning. In the 25-second video clip, the SUV rams protesters, who fall to the ground, while others scramble to get out of the way. Another vehicle, with sirens blaring, is seen tailing the SUV that hit the farmers. The video matches descriptions given to NDTV on Sunday by farmers at the spot, who said the car suddenly hit them from behind. The make and colour of the lead SUV that hits the farmers also matches other visuals from the site. The farmers have alleged that the protesters were run over by an SUV driven by Union Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra's son Ashish Mishra. Both the Minister and his son have denied even being at the spot. The incident took place when a group of protesting farmers in Tikonia area of Kheri tried to block Mr Mishra and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya from visiting. The protesters were upset over a recent speech by Mr Mishra. The farmers claimed the violence broke out after a car in the minister's convoy ran over protesters. Visuals from the area showed arson and vehicles set on fire. A murder case has been filed against the Union minister's son.   Minister Ajay Mishra says he is not aware about any FIR against his son. He has also denied that his son was linked to the violence. ""My son wasn't present at the spot. There were miscreants who attacked workers with sticks and swords. Had my son been there, he wouldn't have come out alive,"" Mr Mishra, the junior Home Minister, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. ""My son was present at the venue of the (Deputy Chief Minister's) event... all through, I was accompanying the deputy chief minister,"" he said. The government has promised to pay a compensation of ₹ 45 lakh to the families of those who died. The injured will receive a compensation of ₹ 10 lakh. A retired judge will investigate the matter, the state government has said."

In a letter written to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the Congress had said a five-member delegation led by Rahul Gandhi planned to visit the district. It also called the detention of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra ""without any reason or justification"". A delegation of Rahul Gandhi, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Channi, party leader KC Venugopal and Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot will reach state capital Lucknow around 1:30 pm. The permission for the visit was denied soon after with the state government citing orders banning large gatherings, news agency ANI reported. Ms Gandhi Vadra, a Congress general secretary, on Tuesday alleged that she was being held illegally at a police compound in Sitapur and no notice or FIR has been provided to her even after her 38-hour detention and was not allowed to meet her legal counsel. In a statement, she said she has not been produced in front of a magistrate or any other judicial officer and neither has she been allowed to meet her legal counsel, who has been standing at the gate of the compound since morning. ""Presently I am not going into the details of the completely illegal physical force used on my colleagues and me at the time of my arrest as this statement serves merely to clarify the continuing illegality of my confinement at the PAC compound in Sitapur, UP,"" she said. ""I have not been served with any order or notice. Nor have they shown me an FIR. I have not been produced in front of a magistrate or any other judicial officer either. I have also not been allowed to meet my legal counsel who has been standing at the gate since morning,"" the Congress leader also said. Ms Gandhi Vadra has been kept in detention since Monday morning after she wanted to meet the families of the victims of the Lakhimpur clashes. She said she has seen a portion of a paper on social media in which the authorities have named 11 people, including eight who were not even present at the time she was arrested. They have even named the two persons ""who brought my clothes from Lucknow on the afternoon of October 4"", she said.   Eight people were killed on Sunday as violence erupted during a farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri, claiming the lives of both farmers and BJP workers ahead of a visit by UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. Four of the dead were people in the cars, apparently part of a convoy of BJP workers who had come to welcome the UP minister and were attacked after allegedly running over the protesting farmers."

Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency, was launched in January 2009, shortly after the financial crisis rattled markets globally. It took it a decade to become one of the most sought-after digital assets. While it remained in oblivion for the most part of that decade, its sudden rise led several such coins to flourish. A primary reason for their rise was the promise of almost vertical returns. It's no surprise then that investors flock to these new digital assets to gain a foothold quickly. But the question still remains: Should one invest in digital assets? Put another way. Why should people invest in digital assets like Bitcoin or any other crypto coin? These coins are extremely volatile — as quickly as they rise, they drop far more rapidly. Since these operate online, what safety features will protect an investor's money? True, most of these digital assets are volatile. Experts say as they grow and gain acceptance and more people begin to trade in or with these coins, they will gain stability, just like stock markets. But what about safety? The cryptocurrency world operates on blockchain technology, which is new and many people are still not versed with it. However, tech experts say the technology is very democratic in its approach and completely safe to use. It is based on the idea of a digital distributed ledger, meaning anyone can see any transaction at any time from anywhere. Every transaction is stored in the form of data on the blockchain and nobody can fiddle with it. There are certain benefits of investing in them as well: 1. Booming Sector Over the past two years, the cryptocurrency market has grown by leaps and bounds. For instance, at the end of 2019, Bitcoin's price was a little over $7,000 (roughly ₹ 5.18 lakhs), but today it is trading above $45,000 (roughly ₹ 33.34 lakhs). It had touched a value above $60,000 (roughly ₹ 44.46 lakhs) both in February and April this year. 2. Digital Ecosystem Not just cryptocurrency, but a whole new digital ecosystem is taking shape in the post-pandemic world. Besides cryptocurrency, there are NFTs or non-fungible tokens. Also, instead of directly investing in crypto coins, techies are also getting involved with the process of generating these coins, called mining, and earning a decent income. 3. Impressive Returns Cryptocurrency gives one the best returns, only matched by the realty sector. Unlike the realty sector, investing in digital assets does not require you to invest a big amount. You can break your investments into several pieces.   4. Passive Income Investing in digital assets and online businesses is a good way to earn a passive income. You can carry on with it alongside your regular investments and money will accumulate in your account through a constant income without breaking much sweat."

Biden senior aide Jake Sullivan hosted Israeli national security adviser Eyal Hulata for talks which, according to a U.S. official, gave the two allies a chance to share intelligence and develop a ""baseline assessment"" of how far Tehran's nuclear program has advanced. Under a 2015 deal, Iran curbed its uranium enrichment program, a possible pathway to nuclear arms, in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. Then-U.S. President Donald Trump quit the deal in 2018 and the Israeli government opposes U.S. efforts to revive it. U.S. experts believe the time it would take Iran to achieve nuclear ""breakout"" enough enriched uranium to build a nuclear bomb has ""gone from about 12 months down to a period of about a few months"" since Trump pulled out of the pact, the U.S. official said earlier, speaking on condition of anonymity. Iran, Israel's regional arch-foe, has consistently denied it is developing a nuclear bomb. Sullivan in Tuesday's talks ""emphasized President Biden's fundamental commitment to Israel's security and to ensuring that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon,"" the White House said in a statement. ""Mr. Sullivan explained that this administration believes diplomacy is the best path to achieve that goal, while also noting that the president has made clear that if diplomacy fails, the United States is prepared to turn to other options,"" it added. Sullivan's words echoed the message that Biden gave Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett during a White House meeting in August. Tuesday's meeting of the U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative Group included military, intelligence and diplomatic officials and came amid stalled international diplomacy with Iran. Western powers have been trying for weeks to get Tehran to commit to resume indirect negotiations with the United States in Vienna. The talks have been on hold since June, after hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi was elected Iran's president, and Tehran has been vague about when it might return to the table. U.S. officials have declined to specify what actions are under consideration if diplomacy with Iran collapses. Asked whether that includes military options, the senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters ahead of Tuesday's talks, said only that ""we'll be prepared to take measures that are necessary."" Behind Tehran's stalling is an attempt to gain leverage to extract more concessions when negotiations do eventually resume, some officials and analysts have said, including by advancing its uranium enrichment program.   Bennett, a far-right politician who ended Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year run as prime minister in June, has made clear he wants Biden to harden his stance against Iran, which Israel considers an existential threat.

Reconciliation at the Group of 20 summit on Oct. 30-31 would follow a Biden-Macron phone call last month and potentially end a transatlantic row triggered last month by the United States' negotiation in secret of a military pact, known as AUKUS, with Australia and Britain to counter China, excluding France. ""We need to look with lucidity at the decisions taken by our allies. There were choices that were made and I can't say that France and Europe were taken into account, but we have a history that is bigger (than this),"" Macron said as he arrived at a summit of EU leaders in Slovenia. ""We will catch up during the G20. I think it is the right occasion to see how we can re-engage,"" Macron said of his planned meeting with Biden. ""It is about facts and what to do together,"" he told reporters at the Brdo estate outside the Slovenian capital Ljubljana. Australia's decision under AUKUS to cancel a lucrative submarine contract with France in September and opt for U.S.-designed, nuclear-propelled vessels incensed Paris. Macron said the episode was a sign that the EU needed to do more on its own, particularly in crises on the 27-nation bloc's borders. The EU has also set out its own strategy to increase its presence in the Indo-Pacific and counter China's rising power. ""We must look at the way Europe should address challenges in its neighbourhood, the crises that exist, its own security and to continue to work in good faith with historic partners and allies,"" Macron said, in reference to the United States. How the EU should deal with China and with the United States was front and centre of the summit dinner. ""We have all observed what happened in Afghanistan, what happened in the Indo-Pacific, what happened with China,"" European Council President Charles Michel, who is chairing the summit, said, referring to U.S. strategy that undermined EU priorities. He said the EU needed to show ""collective intelligence"" to shape Europe's response. Call To Arms Many in Europe now see the abrupt U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which allies felt ignored when they pleaded for more time, as a warning that Washington under Biden is putting its own foreign policy interests first. But the EU also wants to be a useful ally to Washington. ""The United States has recognised the importance of a stronger and more capable European defence,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday before leaving for Slovenia. ""Crises in the European neighbourhood are a call for us to react."" Macron and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met for about 40 minutes in Paris earlier in the day and discussed a French push for more security cooperation among European nations, a U.S. official said. Blinken told Macron that Washington was ""certainly supportive of European defence and security initiatives"" that can increase capabilities but do not undermine the NATO alliance, the senior State Department official said. The EU leaders will be joined on Wednesday by the six Balkan countries hoping one day to join the bloc. As the world's largest trading bloc, the EU wields power in setting rules that can shape policy far beyond its borders, but it has repeatedly failed to coordinate a common foreign and military policy, weakening its influence. It is particularly torn over China, the bloc's second largest trading partner but which Brussels views as a competitor as Beijing seeks to erode the West's technological edge.   The EU, along with the United States, Britain and Canada, imposed sanctions on Chinese officials on March 22 over human rights abuses, which Beijing denies. Beijing immediately hit the EU with sanctions on European Parliament lawmakers, freezing approval of a recently agreed EU-China investment deal.

A three-judge bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao said if a judicial challenge is made to the quota in promotions to the SCs and STs in a particular cadre of a job then the government will have to justify it on grounds such as that they are inadequately represented in a particular cadre and granting quota will not adversely impact the overall administrative efficiency. ""Please do not argue on principles. Show us the data. How do you justify reservations in promotions and what exercise have you undertaken to justify the decisions. Please take instructions and let us know that,"" said the bench which also comprised justices Sanjiv Khanna and BR Gavai. At the outset, Attorney General KK Venugopal, appearing for the centre, referred to the Supreme Court judgements right from the Indra Sawhney verdict of 1992, popularly known as Mandal Commission case to the Jarnail Singh verdict of 2018. The Mandal judgement had ruled out quota in promotions. ""What is relevant is that the Indra Sawhney judgement concerned the backward classes and not the SCs and STs,"" the law officer said. ""This judgement deals with the question of whether every category should be given reservation proportional to their population. It then says ''no it should not be so given'' because then it will far exceed the 50 per cent cap,"" he said. Article 16 of the Constitution requires equality in matters of public employment and if merit alone is the criteria then the SCs and STs, who are disadvantaged socially, might not be able to compete, he said. The law officer said that till 1975, 3.5 per cent SCs and 0.62 per cent of STs were in government employment and this is the average figure. Now in 2008, the figure of SCs and STs in government employment has come to 17.5 and 6.8 per cent respectively which are still low and justify such quota, he said. The court will continue the hearing today. Earlier, the Supreme Court, on September 14, said that it would not reopen its decision on granting reservation in promotions to the SCs and STs as it was for the states to decide how they implement it. ""We are making it very clear that we are not going to reopen Nagraj or Jarnail Singh (cases) because the idea was only to decide these cases in accordance with the law laid down by the court,"" the bench had said. The issues framed by Attorney General KK Venugopal and the ones circulated by others are enhancing the scope of cases, it said. ""We are not willing to do that. There are certain issues that are already decided in Nagraj that also we are not going to take up. We are very clear that we are not going to permit any arguments for reopening of cases or arguing that law laid down from Indira Sawhney is wrong because the very scope of these cases is to apply the law as laid down by this court,"" the bench had said. KK Venugopal had submitted before the Supreme Court that nearly all these issues have been covered by judgements of the Supreme Court and he would give a background of all the cases on the issue of reservation since the Indira Sawhney case. The Attorney General had said the problem of the Union of India is that there are three interim High Court orders passed out which two say that promotions can continue to be made, while one High Court has issued status quo orders on promotions. ""The Government of India has 1,400 posts (secretariat level) stagnating where no promotions could be made on a regular basis because all three orders dealt with regular promotions. The issue is whether the promotions for regular appointments can be continued to be made and whether it affects the reserved seats. ""There are another 2,500 posts stagnating for years due to status quo orders relating to regular promotions. The government wants to make those promotions on an adhoc basis without any rights,"" KK Venugopal had said while seeking a stay on a contempt plea against the government official. Earlier, Maharashtra and other states had said the promotions have been made in unreserved categories, but promotions have not been granted in reserved categories for SC and ST employees. In 2018, a five-judge constitution bench had refused to refer the 2006 judgement in the M Nagraj case, in which the creamy layer concept was extended to the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) to a larger seven-judge bench for reconsideration.   It had also paved the way for a grant of quota for promotions in the government jobs to SCs and STs and had modified the 2006 judgement to the extent that the states will not be required to ""collect quantifiable data"" reflecting the backwardness among these communities to justify the quota in promotions. However, the Supreme Court, in 2018, had upheld the other conditions such as the governments will have to justify promotions in quota for SCs and STs by establishing that their representation in that particular kind of job is inadequate and this would not impact the overall administrative efficiency."

The Lokmanya Tilak Marg Police Station in South Mumbai, which arrested the accused and probed the case, filed a chargesheet within a fortnight of the incident, he said. The incident took place on September 18 near a garden on Maharshi Karve Road where the accused, Rajkumar Tandel, stalked a woman and flashed at her, the official said.

Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for WHO's Covid-19, said last week 3.1 million known new cases were reported to the UN health agency, and 54,000 more deaths -- though the true numbers would be much higher. ""The situation is still incredibly dynamic. And it's dynamic because we don't have control over this virus,"" she said during a live presentation on the WHO's social media channels. ""We're not out of the woods. We're very much in the middle of this pandemic. But where in the middle... we're not quite sure yet, because frankly we're not using the tools we have right now to get us closer to the end.""

Van Kerkhove said deaths now were largely happening among people who had not been vaccinated. ""From the countries that are providing that information, the rate of hospitalisation and death is by far really among those who are unvaccinated,"" she said. Van Kerkhove also hit out at Covid-19 misinformation and disinformation circulating on the internet. ""It is resulting in people dying. There is no way to sugar-coat that,"" she said. Van Kerkhove said the WHO was having discussions about the shape of the pandemic over the next three to 18 months. The US expert said she saw Covid-19 eventually coming under control. ""But we will still have pockets of individuals who are not vaccinated -- either because they don't have access, they refuse, or they can't be vaccinated -- and we can still see outbreaks,"" she said.

The NCB has so far arrested 16 people, including Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan (23), in the drug seizure case. Earlier on Tuesday, additional chief metropolitan magistrate RM Nerlikar remanded Abdul Qadir Sheikh (30), Shreyas Nair (23), Manish Rajgariya (26) and Avin Sahu (30) to the NCB custody till October 11. The court on Monday remanded Aryan Khan and seven others to the NCB custody till Thursday. Before making his submissions for the remand of the four accused, special public prosecutor (SPP) Advait Sethna on Tuesday told the court that this case has become ""like Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes novels as there is a new twist and turn at every moment"". Remanding the four in the NCB custody till October 11, additional chief metropolitan magistrate RM Nerlikar said that considering the nature of the offence, a detailed investigation was necessary to go to the root of the case. Mr Sethna then moved an application seeking to conduct the remand proceedings of Sheikh in the presence of limited people. To this, the judge said, ""It means you want in-camera proceedings"". The SPP's response was affirmative. The NCB said, ""it was forced to take this step (seeking proceedings in the presence of a limited number of people) as today's remand is already in (media) coverage"". The anti-drugs agency said it wanted to find out how it (remand) was leaked. It further submitted that a request has been made to minimise the exposure of the accused. However, the magistrate asked how Sheikh's identity could be protected when his name is already mentioned in the remand application. On the NCB's regarding the presence of media persons, the court said it cannot restrain media and rejected the application. Seeking custody, Sethna told the court that Sheikh was arrested from suburban Jogeshwari in Mumbai around 6 PM on Monday and a commercial quantity (of a drug) was seized from him. The NCB said it had seized 2.5 gm Ecstacy and 54.3 gm Mephedrone from Sheikh. He was arrested based on the information revealed during the custodial interrogation of other arrested accused Mohak Jaswal, the NCB said. The agency further submitted that 2 gm Charas was recovered from Nair. According to the NCB, both Sheikh and Nair are (drug) suppliers. The two other arrested accused (Rajgariya and Sahu) were guests on the cruise ship. In view of the seizures, ""a nexus, links, role and involvement of all these persons required further corroboration,"" the NCB said. Sheikh, Nair, Rajgariya and Sahu were booked under sections 8(c) (produce, manufacture, possess, sell or purchase of drugs) and 27 (punishment for consumption of any narcotics or drugs) and 27 A ( punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders) of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS). Advocate Apoorv Srivastava, appearing for Sheikh, said his client was made a ""scapegoat to hide big faces"". Mr Srivastava contended that Sheikh didn't know Jaswal. The advocate said he didn't understand why Jaswal took Sheikh's name. He further said that Sheikh was arrested a day after the seizure of drugs which means it was a ""premeditated case"". The advocate, however, said Sheikh may be sent to custody for investigation for a brief period. Advocates of other accused objected to the remand application of the NCB, saying either a small number of drugs was seized from their clients or no seizure was made at all. The anti-drugs agency has so far arrested 16 people, including Aryan Khan, after raiding the Goa-bound ship on Saturday. The court on Monday had remanded Aryan Khan (23) and seven other accused to the NCB custody till Thursday. The NCB had told the court that ""shocking and incriminating"" material recovered in WhatsApp chats of Aryan Khan and two others arrested in connection with the case showed international drug trafficking. The NCB had also claimed that in the WhatsApp chats, Aryan Khan is discussing modes of payment to be done for procurement (of drugs) and that several code names are being used.   Aryan Khan's lawyer had claimed drugs were not recovered from the possession of his client. The NCB on Sunday said they had seized 13 grams of cocaine, five grams of MD, 21 grams of charas and 22 pills of Ecstasy and ₹ 1.33 lakh."

""People have several videos that will come up as soon as the net is restored,"" he said. ""The district administration has said they will arrest the minister's son in a week. If it does not happen, we will assemble at one place on the day of ""bhog"" of all four farmers, when it is held in eight to ten days. We will then discuss and decide our next strategy,"" he added. Mr Tikait said people of the area have told him that the minister and his son are criminals. ""They are involved in diesel theft. They have three petrol pumps in Nepal where diesel is cheaper by ₹ 15 to 20,"" he said.

According to a report from Lakhimpur Kheri, district officials on Tuesday night handed over compensation cheques of ₹ 45 lakh each to the family of two Kheri farmers under the agreement between agitating farmers and authorities. The dead farmers whose family were given the compensation cheques are Lavpreet Singh of Palia tehsil and Nakshatra Singh of Dhaurahra tehsil.

""I've spoken with Xi about Taiwan. We agree ... we'll abide by the Taiwan agreement,"" he said. ""We made it clear that I don't think he should be doing anything other than abiding by the agreement."" Biden appeared to be referring to Washington's long-standing ""one-China policy"" under which it officially recognizes Beijing rather than Taipei, and the Taiwan Relations Act, which makes clear that the U.S. decision to establish diplomatic ties with Beijing instead of Taiwan rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means. The comments to reporters at the White House -- made after Biden's return from a trip to Michigan touting a spending package - come amid escalations in the Taiwan-China relationship. China claims Taiwan as its own territory, which should be taken by force if necessary. Taiwan says it is an independent country and will defend its freedoms and democracy, blaming China for the tensions.

Shortly after the team's arrival in the state capital on Tuesday, its members held a meeting with officials of State Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), chief medical officers (CMOs) of Aizawl East and Aizawl West and discussed ways to combat the situation. The team will hold another virtual meeting with chief medical officers of various districts on Wednesday to review the measures being taken to control the spread of the disease across the state, the statement said. The members of the central team will also visit COVID-19 care facilities in Aizawl West during the day. Mizoram continues to register a spike in coronavirus cases with 1,681 new infections reported on Tuesday, which pushed the state's tally to 99,856, a health department official said. The death count rose to 331 as five more people succumbed to the infection, he said. The single-day positivity rate stood at 18 per cent as the fresh cases were detected from 9,331 sample tests. At least 322 children were among the newly infected people, he said. Meanwhile, a state-level expert team on COVID-19 management, which was formed in September, underlined that more attention has to be paid to symptomatic patients, high-risk groups such as pregnant women and the elderly with comorbid conditions. The team convener, Dr F Lallianhlira, who is also principal director of state health department, told a press meet on Tuesday that a report has been submitted to the state government, seeking revision of standard operating procedure (SOP) for COVID-19 test and home isolation, among other suggestions. The expert team has also recommended strengthening of COVID-19 care facilities in the state and establishment of a dedicated wing in all district hospitals, he said. Mizoram currently has just one COVID-19 hospital, the Zoram Medical College (ZMC), with 341 beds including 34 in ICU, and around 18 dedicated health centres (DCHCs). A ten-day campaign to sensitise people about the importance of using face mask and sanitiser is likely to be organised from October 11, Lallianhlira added. Opposition Congress, during the day, staged a demonstration in Aizawl, blaming the state government for the COVID-19 situation in Mizoram. The protesters sought setting up of a COVID-19 designated hospital in all the districts, and arrangement of relief for the poor amid the pandemic. They also demanded health minister Dr R Lalthangliana's resignation. Addressing an event, Congress Legislature Party leader Zodintluanga Ralte alleged that the ruling Mizo National Front government, headed by Chief Minister Zoramthanga, has ""completely failed to control the rising COVID-19 cases"" in the state.   He held Dr Lalthangliana and health and family welfare board senior member Dr ZR Thiamsanga, who is also chairman of medical operational team of COVID-19, responsible for the current state of affairs in Mizoram. ""I deeply regret the fact that over 300 people lost their lives due to COVID-19. Several residents are facing livelihood crisis due to the inefficiency of the health minister and medical operational team chairman,"" Mr Ralte added."

As of September 30, 2020, the US military maintained 3,750 active and inactive nuclear warheads, down by 55 from a year earlier and by 72 from the same date in 2017. The figure was also the lowest level since the US nuclear stockpile peaked at the height of the Cold War with Russia in 1967, when the total was 31,255 warheads. The numbers were released Tuesday amid an effort by the administration of President Joe Biden to restart arms controls talks with Russia after they stalled under Trump. ""Increasing the transparency of states' nuclear stockpiles is important to nonproliferation and disarmament efforts,"" the State Department said in a statement. Trump, who pulled the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia, also left another crucial pact, the New Start Treaty on the rocks last year before its scheduled expiration on February 5. New Start caps the number of nuclear warheads held by Washington and Moscow, and letting it expire could have sparked a reversal of warhead reductions on both sides. Trump said he wanted a new deal that includes China, which only has a fraction of the warheads that the United States and Russia have. Biden, who came in to office on January 20, immediately proposed a five-year extension to New Start, which Russian President Vladimir Putin quickly agreed to. The deal caps at 1,550 the number of nuclear warheads that can be deployed by Moscow and Washington. Last week Russian and US diplomats held talks behind closed doors in Geneva to begin discussions on a successor to New Start and also controls on conventional weapons. A US official called the talks ""productive,"" but both sides said the mere fact of holding the talks was positive. According to a January 2021 tally by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which includes retired warheads -- not counted in the State Department's numbers -- the United States had 5,550 warheads, compared to 6,255 in Russia, 350 in China, 225 in Britain, and 290 in France.   India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea have together around 460 nuclear warheads, according to the institute.

In April 2019, the IAF issued an RFI (Request for Information), or initial tender, to acquire 114 jets at a cost of around USD 18 billion. It was billed as one of the world's biggest military procurement programmes in recent years. Addressing a press conference ahead of the Air Force Day on October 8, the IAF Chief said the response to the RFI has been received from several aerospace firms and that the acquisition process is taken forward to the next phase. ""The project would be under the Make In India initiative...We are moving the case further,"" he said, replying to a question on the mega procurement. The top contenders for the deal include Lockheed Martin's F-21, Boeing's F/A-18, Dassault Aviation's Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Russian aircraft MiG 35 and Saab's Gripen. When asked whether the IAF would go for an additional 36 Rafale aircraft to deal with immediate requirements, the Chief of Air Staff suggested that the fighter jet could be one of the contenders for the MRFA project. Last year, the then IAF Chief RKS Bhadauria did not rule out procurement of more Rafale jets, and said the induction of the French-made multi-role aircraft has given the Indian Air Force an operational edge to strike ""deep and hard"". There has been a view among some officials in the military establishment that the IAF should at least have four squadrons of Rafale jets considering its operational aspects. There are 18 aircraft in a squadron. Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari said procurement of 114 jets under the MRFA project and acquisition of 83 Light Combat Aircraft Tejas will help the IAF significantly in the face of a gradual drop in the number of fighter squadrons due to phasing out of the fleets of Jaguar, Mirage and the MiG 29. He also said that the IAF is fully committed to the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) aircraft project. India is also working on an ambitious USD 5 billion project to develop a fifth-generation medium weight deep penetration fighter jet to significantly bolster its air power capability. The IAF chief said the force is looking at technologies for the aircraft that can integrate fifth and sixth generation technologies, adding the plan is to induct the AMCA by the early years of the next decade.   He said the IAF will not be able to reach the sanctioned strength of 42 squadrons in the next 10-15 years notwithstanding all the planned acquisitions. The Air Chief Marshal said the IAF would have 35 squadrons by the next decade with phasing out of old aircraft and induction of new ones."

During a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing, whistleblower Frances Haugen called for transparency about how Facebook entices users to extend their stay on the site, giving them ample opportunity to advertise to them. ""As long as Facebook is operating in the shadows, hiding its research from public scrutiny, it is unaccountable,"" said Haugen, a former employee of the nearly $1 trillion company who turned whistleblower. ""The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people. Congressional action is needed,"" Haugen said. In an era when bipartisanship is rare in Washington, lawmakers from both parties excoriated the company, illustrating the rising anger in Congress with Facebook amid numerous demands for legislative reforms. Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said he was concerned about how Facebook and subsidiaries like Instagram affected the mental health of children. ""I think we're going to look back 20 years from now and all of us are going to be like 'what the hell were we thinking?'"" Haugen revealed she was the one who provided documents used in a Wall Street Journal investigation and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teenage girls. She compared the social media sites to addictive substances like tobacco and opioids. Panel chair Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said Facebook knew that its products were addictive. ""Tech now faces that big tobacco jaw-dropping moment of truth,"" he said. He called for Zuckerberg to testify before the committee, and for the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission to investigate the company. ""Our children are the ones who are victims. Teens today looking in the mirror feel doubt and insecurity. Mark Zuckerberg ought to be looking at himself in the mirror,"" Blumenthal said. Blumenthal said after the hearing that he would want to ask Zuckerberg why he rejected recommendations to make the company's products safer for users. SHARES UP Despite the criticism, Facebook's share price was up 2.2% at $333.43 in the mid-afternoon on Tuesday. Coming a day after Facebook suffered an hours-long outage, Haugen pointed to the breakdown in her testimony: ""For more than five hours Facebook wasn't used to deepen divides, destabilize democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies."" As lawmakers criticized Facebook and Zuckerberg, the company's spokespeople fought back on Twitter, arguing Haugen did not work directly on some of the issues she was being questioned on. Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team, left the company with tens of thousands of confidential documents. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, accused Facebook of turning a blind eye to children below age 13 on its sites. ""It is clear that Facebook prioritizes profit over the well-being of children and all users,"" she said. Lena Pietsch, a Facebook spokeswoman, disputed Haugen's knowledge of the company's inner workings. ""We don't agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about,"" Pietsch said in a statement. Last week, Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety, defended the company in front of Congress and said that it was seeking to release additional internal studies in an effort to be more transparent about its findings. Senator Maria Cantwell, chair of the Commerce Committee, said she would write a letter to Facebook to insist that it not delete documents related to Myanmar's persecuted Muslim minority Rohingya. An aide said she would ask for broader retention of documents. Haugen said she would encourage ""oversight and public scrutiny"" into how the content algorithms work and the consequences of them. She suggested creating a dedicated body within the federal government to oversee social media companies. Blumenthal said that he might want to hold an additional hearing to discuss national security issues related to Facebook. Haugen said Facebook had also done too little to prevent its site from being used by people planning violence. Facebook was used by people planning mass killings in Myanmar and the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump who were determined to toss out the 2020 election results. Senator Edward Markey, speaking to the absent Zuckerberg, said during the hearing: ""Your time of invading our privacy, and preying on children is over. Congress will be taking action.""   Throughout the hearing lawmakers referred to Zuckerberg as going sailing instead of facing his responsibilities. The CEO this weekend posted a video taken with the company's new smart glasses of his wife in a boat.

The National Public Health Commission has decided to offer the booster jab vaccinations from late October to elderly people who received a second vaccine dose more than six months ago, the ministry said in a statement. Spain had until now only offered third doses to care home residents and some people with compromised immune systems. ""The aim is to increase protection of the most vulnerable,"" the ministry said. Europe's medicines watchdog on Monday approved a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for over-18s, against a background of fears their protection against the virus could diminish over time. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also approved booster doses of both the Pfizer and Moderna shots for seriously immunocompromised people. More than 15 countries worldwide have begun issuing third doses, including in European Union nations including France, Italy and Germany.   Eyeing a potential winter resurgence of Covid, some countries did not wait for EU authorities' approval for their schemes.

""Our clinical program has found that a booster of our Covid-19 vaccine increases levels of protection for those who have received our single-shot vaccine to 94 percent,"" said Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development at J&J. J&J said that when a booster was given six months after the first shot, ""antibody levels increased nine-fold one week after the booster and continued to climb to 12-fold higher four weeks after the booster,"" irrespective of age. ""We look forward to our discussions with the FDA and other health authorities to support their decisions regarding boosters,"" Mammen said. President Joe Biden's administration announced plans in August for Americans vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines to get third shots. Biden personally received a Covid-19 vaccine booster shot last month and told Americans still resisting vaccination they are damaging the country. The president received a third Pfizer dose in line with recently approved health guidance, which allows boosters for those 65 or older. Also eligible for boosters are adults with high-risk medical conditions and those in jobs where they are frequently exposed to the virus.   The FDA said Tuesday its advisory committee will meet on October 14 to discuss an emergency use authorization of Moderna booster shots and on October 15 to disuss the J&J booster.

In view of the coronavirus outbreak, the HC had earlier fixed the maximum number of devotees that can visit the temples daily at 1,000 for Badrinath, 800 for Kedarnath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for Yamunotri. Now after the court order, there will be no daily limit from Wednesday.

The Ministry of Electronics and information Technology (MeitY) said the sale of Shein products on other platforms or websites is not covered under Section 69A (Power to issue directions for blocking for public access of any information through any computer resource) of the IT Act and a blanket order for blocking their sale cannot be passed by the committee constituted under the legal provision. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh was hearing a plea seeking to prohibit the re-entry of Chinese fashion brand ""Shein"" in India through sale of its products on digital marketplace, Amazon. ""According to them, there is no bar on sale. What do you have to say on this?"" the bench asked the counsel for petitioner Ananttika Singh. The counsel for Amazon submitted that they are yet to receive a copy of the petition. The court directed the petitioner to supply a copy of the petition to Amazon's counsel and granted time to file reply and listed the matter for further hearing on December 1. The ministry, in its reply filed through central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia, said public access and functionality of the Shein app was blocked within India in 2020 but the products of Shein being sold on a third party platform in India is altogether a different aspect. ""It is made clear that the Shein app was found to be detrimental to the national security related issues, hence the ""App"" was blocked. However, the sale of Shein products on other platforms/ websites is not covered under Section 69A of the IT Act. A blanket order for blocking sale of Shein products on other websites cannot be passed by the committee constituted under Section 69A of the IT Act,"" it said. The ministry said that by an interim order, Shein app was blocked on June 29 last year in the interest of India's sovereignty and security of the State and in January this year, MeitY blocked the app permanently for public access. ""Every incident violating the provisions of Section 69A of the IT Act related to already blocked information or content has to be reported separately by following the due process,"" it said. The high court had earlier issued notice on the petition on the ground that Shein was temporarily banned in India by the Centre last year for being prejudicial to the interest and sovereignty of India. The court, however, had refused to pass any interim order to stay the sale at this stage. Senior Advocate Vivek Raj Singh, appearing for petitioner Ananttika Singh, urged the court to pass an interim stay order, saying otherwise data will be transferred to Chinese company. He said section 69A of the IT Act relates to integrity and sovereignity of the country and these apps were banned because customer details were being passed on to Chinese makers. Now they are approaching the country through a different platform, he said. The counsel had earlier informed the court that there was an advertisement on Amazon which publicised the sale of Shein products on its platform as part of its prime day sale. He had said 59 Chinese apps, including Shein, were banned by the Government of India on June 29, 2020, and pleaded that consequently there should be a total prohibition on the sale of Shein products in the country. In her PIL, the petitioner has sought a direction to Amazon to suspend its partnership with Shein until the ban imposed by Centre is not lifted. It said once the entry of Shein and its products was banned for using data of its Indian customers in a manner prejudicial to the interest and sovereignty of the country, it cannot be allowed to circumvent the law by using a third party platform.   The petition highlights that as per Amazon's privacy policy, it could share the data collected from users with registered sellers and it was thus possible that ""Shein"" would once again have access to personal and sensitive data of several millions of Indian citizen. The petition also sought a direction to the Centre to appoint a third party committee, with costs to Amazon, to make audits on the flow of data of the India consumers to Shein."

Addressing a press conference ahead of Air Force Day on October 8, he said the IAF is fully prepared to deal with any security challenge in eastern Ladakh and that new airbases and other infrastructure created by the Chinese side in the region will not affect his force's combat readiness. The newly-appointed Chief of Air Staff spoke on a range of issues including the IAF's modernisation plan, dealing with new security challenges in the wake of geopolitical developments, enhancing the force's capability to deal with rogue drones and phasing out old aircraft like the MiG-21 jets. Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari said the IAF should have around 35 fighter squadrons by the next decade as he talked about the phasing out of old aircraft and induction of new ones. He said there are four MiG-21 squadrons and the plan is to retire them in the next three to four years. Asked about security threats emanating from close ties between Islamabad and Beijing, he said there was nothing to worry about the partnership, but flagged concerns over the possibility of western technology reaching China from Pakistan. Assuring the nation that the IAF will be ever ready to safeguard the nation's sovereignty and interests in all circumstances, Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari said his force is effectively capable of dealing with a ""two-front"" war scenario involving China and Pakistan. Replying to a question on China ramping up infrastructure development along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, he said India was aware of it and noted that the neighbouring country continued its deployment at three airbases in the Tibet region. However, he said the building of airfields and other infrastructure by China will not impact India's military preparedness and suggested that the Chinese military has the disadvantage of high altitude in the region. ""That is a weak area for them."" ""We are fully prepared to deal with any situation and challenge in the region,"" said the IAF chief. Air Chief Marshal Chaudhary also noted that the IAF was fully committed to theaterisation concept to maximise the utilisation of military resources. But noted that wider discussions on the requirement of each service should be ensured to carry forward the initiative. ""Various options are being discussed among three forces...Strengths of each service need to be taken into account,"" the IAF chief said. In July, the then IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria flagged concerns over the theaterisation plan arguing that there was a need to get the structures right. The theatre commands are being planned to integrate the capabilities of the three services and to ensure optimal utilisation of their resources. The theatre commands are being set up under a larger mandate of ensuring synergy among the three service chiefs to deal with future security challenges. Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat has been focusing on bringing convergence among the three services and restructuring military commands to effectively deal with future security challenges. There has been a growing perception that the Indian Air Force has some reservations about the theaterisation programme. Asked about the delivery of the S-400 air defence systems by Russia, the Air Chief marshal said the first batch is expected to arrive within this year. On the deployment of anti-drone technology, he said efforts are underway to enhance indigenous capabilities. To a question, he admitted that the IAF has had a large number of accidents involving the MiG-21 fleet but noted that there has been a reduction in such accidents.   On the proposed procurement of 114 medium combat aircraft, the IAF chief said the response to the Request for Information (RFI) has been received from several aerospace forms and that the process is taken forward to the next phase. He said the IAF''s strike capability has become more potent with the induction of Rafale jets and various weapons."

COP26 president Alok Sharma said that despite grumbling on the party's right wing at its annual conference, MPs all saw the potential for a green economic revolution. ""Sometimes people don't perceive the Conservatives as leading on this,"" the former business minister said on the sidelines of the conference in Manchester, northwest England. ""Cabinet colleagues actually understand why it's vitally important to get this right,"" he said, ahead of the two-week COP26 summit in Scotland starting on October 31. ""And we're seeing the benefits of that coming through in terms of growth, in terms of cutting emissions."" ""This is a real, real opportunity to create jobs, to create growth, to have a healthier country, a healthier planet."" In his speech closing the Conservative gathering on Wednesday, Johnson is also expected to talk up Britain's action on climate change and the need for global coordination. Touring exhibitors' stands at the conference on Tuesday, Johnson rode an e-bike, got in a electric tractor, and played with a puzzle to assemble a zero-carbon energy house. But at the Manchester gathering as a whole, the topic of climate change has been relegated to the back burner this week. Sharma was not given one of the headline speaking slots. And the issue was absent from finance minister Rishi Sunak's keynote address on Monday, when he laid out a strategy to fix Britain's finances and focus on tech-led growth after the Covid crisis. 'Irresponsible crusties' The omission was a ""damaging sign"" ahead of COP26 in Glasgow, commented Rebecca Newsom, head of policy for Greenpeace UK. ""Coughing up more cash for green infrastructure now would save enormous costs later and create millions of new jobs across the UK,"" she said. ""At a time when we need spending commitments for a zero carbon future, Rishi sounds like he's preparing to take a big step backwards."" Nor did Foreign Secretary Liz Truss use the C word -- climate -- in her own speech on Sunday, save for a fleeting promise to support ""greener"" growth and ""clean infrastructure"" in developing countries. In contrast the B word -- Brexit -- has been a recurrent theme for delegates of Johnson's party, adamant that current problems associated with the EU divorce will pass. Brexit minister David Frost admonished the ""anti-transport, anti-car"" lobby's ""anti-growth ideologies"" and ""persistent miserabilism"", arguing that human ingenuity and technological innovation will save the day. Interior minister Priti Patel used her own speech on Tuesday to promise tougher police and court action against climate protestors who have been blockading UK roads and whom Johnson characterised as ""irresponsible crusties"".   ""I will not tolerate so-called eco-warriors trampling over our way of life and draining police resources,"" she said to applause from the Tory faithful.

Altogether 26 officials of NOIDA, four directors of real estate developer Supertech Group and two architects have been named as accused in the complaint, the officials said. NOIDA CEO Ritu Maheshwari confirmed the development and said the authority will be going ahead with demolition planning of the twin towers that have come up in Sector 93A of the city in violation of building norms. The Supreme Court, which had ordered the demolition of the under-construction 40-storey towers on August 31, on Monday quashed a ""modification application"" filed by Supertech Group. While delivering its August 31 verdict, the Supreme Court had set a three-month timeline for NOIDA to raze down the towers. ""Yes, the authority shall try to plan and have (the order) implemented as per SC directions,"" Ms Maheshwari told PTI. Officials said the state vigilance department shall now lodge an FIR on the basis of the complaint and take action. Earlier on Sunday, the Uttar Pradesh government said it has suspended three more Noida Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA) officers over their role in the case. One officer was already put under suspension from work. A special investigation team (SIT) formed by the UP government had probed the matter and found 26 officials of NOIDA guilty in the case of which 20 have retired, two have died and four are still serving. Besides them, four Supertech directors and two architects were also found guilty in the case and action was ordered against them also. The four-member special investigation team was formed in September to probe the matter and fix responsibility of officials, and was given a week's time to submit its report. The SIT had sought time extension to complete the probe. The case pertained to realty firm Supertech constructing two 40-storey towers illegally in its Emerald Court housing project premises with over 900 flats and 21 shops in the twin towers. Residents of the housing project claimed their consent was not taken for the twin towers, which were being built in violation of norms, and moved court. The Allahabad High Court had in 2014 ordered demolition of the twin towers with the Supreme Court upholding the verdict in 2021.   However, buyers who have invested their money in these towers hoped their interest would be protected, even as Supertech Group has filed a ""modification application"" in the Supreme Court.

Talking to the media in Kolkata, Mr Das, an MLA from Surma assembly seat in northern Tripura, also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ""selling most government properties to private parties"".   ""Once Modi's messages stirred and touched the minds of people from all sections across the country. Modi had once said 'na khaunga, na khane dunga'.

The suggestion from the leaders of the Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees - Democrats Bob Menendez and Mark Warner and Republicans Jim Risch and Marco Rubio - would mark a sharp escalation in an ongoing dispute over embassy staffing amid tension between Washington and Moscow. Russia in August banned the U.S. embassy in Moscow from retaining, hiring or contracting Russian or third-country staff, except for guards, forcing the mission to let go 182 employees and dozens of contractors, the State Department said. That meant there are only about 100 U.S. diplomats in Russia, compared with 400 Russian diplomats across the United States, the senators said. ""This disproportionality in diplomatic representation is unacceptable. Accordingly, Russia must issue enough visas to approach parity between the number of American diplomats serving in Russia and the number of Russian diplomats serving in the United States,"" the senators wrote in a letter to Biden. If Moscow does not do so, they said Biden should begin expelling as many as 300 Russian diplomats.   The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The revelations in France are the latest to rock the Roman Catholic Church, after a series of sexual abuse scandals around the world, often involving children. The church had shown ""deep, total and even cruel indifference for years,"" protecting itself rather than the victims of what was systemic abuse, said Jean-Marc Sauve, head of the commission that compiled the report. Most of the victims were boys, he said, many of them aged between 10 and 13. The church not only did not take the necessary measures to prevent abuse but also failed to report it and sometimes knowingly putting children in touch with predators, he said. Speaking just after Sauve at the public presentation of the report, the archbishop of Reims and head of the French conference of bishops, Eric de Moulins-Beaufort, spoke of shame, asked for forgiveness and promised to act. The commission was established by Catholic bishops in France at the end of 2018 to shed light on abuses and restore public confidence in the church at a time of dwindling congregations. It has worked independently from the Church. Sauve said the problem was still there. He added that the church had until the 2000s shown complete indifference to victims and that it only started to really change its attitude in 2015-2016. CHURCH URGED TO REFORM The Catholic Church's teaching on subjects such as sexuality, obedience and the sanctity of the priesthood helped create blind spots which allowed sexual abuse by clergy to happen, Sauve said, adding that the church needed to reform the way it approached those issues to rebuild trust with society. Sauve said the commission itself had identified around 2,700 victims through a call for testimony, and thousands more had been found in archives. But a wide-ranging study by research and polling groups estimated that there had been around 216,000 victims, and the number could rise to 330,000 when including abuse by lay members. There have been around 2,900-3,200 suspected paedophiles in the French church over the last 70 years, he added. The French findings come a year after Britain said the Catholic Church had received more than 900 complaints involving over 3,000 instances of child sex abuse in England and Wales between 1970 and 2015, and that there had been more than 100 reported allegations a year since 2016. Before Sauve took the floor, Francois Devaux, who set up victims' association La Parole Liberee, told church representatives at the public presentation of the report: ""You are a disgrace to our humanity,"" , before Sauve took the floor. ""In this hell there have been abominable mass crimes ... but there has been even worse, betrayal of trust, betrayal of morale, betrayal of children,"" said Devaux, who also accused the church of cowardice.   He thanked the commission, saying that he hoped the report would prove a turning point: ""You finally bring victims an institutional recognition of the responsibility of the church.""

The Chief of Air Staff said India is fully ready to deal with a ""two-front"" war scenario involving China and Pakistan and that the focus has been to enhance the IAF's overall combat capabilities.

The theatre commands are being planned to integrate capabilities of the three services and to ensure optimal utilisation of their resources.

Pyongyang is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, which have seen rapid progress under current leader Kim Jong Un. The report's publication comes after Pyongyang sparked international concern with a series of missile tests in the span of a few weeks, prompting the UN Security Council to hold an emergency meeting. The report -- which was published online Tuesday Seoul time, and covers the period from February 6 to August 3 -- said the North continued to polish its weapons programmes. ""Despite the country's focus on its worsening economic travails, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continued to maintain and develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs,"" said the report, compiled by a panel of experts monitoring sanctions on the isolated country. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of the North, which like the South last month saw the 30th anniversary of their simultaneous admission to the United Nations. Pyongyang has not carried out an intercontinental ballistic missile launch or nuclear test since 2017 but the report said tests ""combining ballistic and guidance technologies"" were conducted while activity continued at key sites related to the nuclear programme. In early 2020 the country closed its borders to try to protect itself against the coronavirus pandemic, which first emerged in neighbouring China, but has nonetheless ""continued its illicit efforts to procure specific components from overseas and to seek opportunities to transfer its own products to its partners"", the report added. It said the North's coronavirus blockade had continued ""fundamentally to impact the movement of people and goods, both licit and illicit, within, into and out of the country"". The import of consumer products, including luxury goods banned under UN sanctions, had ""virtually stopped"", the report said, but said it was investigating illicit transfers of luxury vehicles. Leader Kim has been seen using Lexus SUVs in recent months and the report highlighted an attempted shipment of more than $1 million-worth of luxury vehicles, including such models, allegedly from the United Arab Emirates to Ningbo, China, for onward delivery to the North. Pyongyang has stayed away from nuclear talks since the collapse of a second summit between Kim and then US president Donald Trump in Hanoi and has rebuffed South Korean efforts to revive dialogue. Under President Joe Biden, the United States has repeatedly declared its willingness to meet North Korean representatives, while saying it will seek denuclearisation.   Last week, Kim decried Washington's repeated offers of talks without preconditions as a ""petty trick"", accusing the Biden administration of continuing the ""hostile policy"" of its predecessors.

Nevertheless, many organisers seemed overjoyed at the DDMA permit, allowing to have physical celebrations after the festivities were organised virtually last year. The Lav Kush Ramlila Committee that organises Ramlila at Red Fort every year, will have the COVID-19 protocols in place for the next 10 days, from October 6 to 16. “We will follow all the DDMA guidelines during the celebrations. Social distancing will be maintained with chairs placed five feet away from each other. Banners of ‘no mask, no entry' will be put up at the venue, and sanitisation will be mandatory,” said Arjun Kumar, Secretary of the committee that organised the Ram Lila virtually last year. He added that the “maidan” will be cleaned every day with help from the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to ensure cleanliness and hygiene. Ramlila is a theatrical reenactment of Hindu God Rama's life, capturing his journey along with his wife Sita and brother Lakshman, as he is exiled from his own kingdom, his fight and eventual victory over demon king Ravana that is retold every year around this time to celebrate the triumph of good over evil, culminating on Dussehra. The Shri Dharmik Leela Committee that too stages the Ram Lila performances at the Red Fort every year since 1924, has shrunk its 10-day programme to a single day celebration at the ISKCON temple in the East of Kailash. “The Lal Quila Maidan made sense when we had a footfall of over five lakh people over 10 days…when it was like a ‘mela' with not just the performances, but also food stalls, swings and rides for the children. “This year, we will pack the performance that used to happen over 10 days, into a single day's worth of celebrations,” said Ravi Jain, Press Secretary of the committee. With the DDMA's nod for physical Ramlila celebrations coming on September 30, less than a week before the festival begins on October 6, the Shri Ram Lila Committee, that hosts the festivities at the Ramlila Maidan in Ajmeri Gate, has decided to skip the event this year.   “They can give us permission two days before and expect us to organise an event like this. You need time, money, and the requisite infrastructure to enable the organisers to put together such a grand event. “We start our preparations at least one month in advance, but this year the conditions are such that we are doing nothing,” said Rajesh Khanna, Secretary General of the committee."

Lovepreet Singh, in his dying moments, called his father from his hospital bed and begged him to come quickly. ""When they took him to hospital, he called, I said 'Beta, how are you'. He said 'Papa, main theek hoon. Jaldi aa jao (I am ok. Please come soon)'. I said we are on our way. But when we reached Lakhimpur Kheri, he had died,"" said Lovepreet's father Satnam Singh, choking up. Lovepreet Singh and three more farmers were among the eight killed in the violence during a protest against Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra's visit. Four farmers were run over by a car in the minister's convoy. Later, there were clashes and cars were burnt at the spot. Farmers allege that car was being driven by the minister's son, Ashish Mishra. The UP police have filed a case against him. Weeping next to his body in a glass casket, his family today refused to cremate him until they were given the autopsy report and a copy of the FIR against Ashish Mishra. A large number of relatives and neighbours sat next to the body, waiting. ""My son was mercilessly crushed...They have not taken any action against the person responsible. The administration's response has been weak,"" said Mr Singh. Lovepreet's two sisters mourned their youngest brother, his body in a glass casket since Sunday. He had left home saying he was heading out for a good cause. ""My son told us he is going for the farmers' protest. He said black flags will be shown...They were brutally crushed by cars from the back. The cars tried to remove the protesters...Ajay-ji's (Union Minister Ajay Mishra) son was probably behind the wheel."" After hours of negotiation between farmers and the police, Lovepreet's cremation took place at 3 pm. His body was taken out of the glass case to a field about 100 metres away, where a funeral pyre had been readied. During the short walk from their home to the pyre, Lovepreet's mother fainted several times, beside herself with grief. His father, composed so far and talking to journalists about his son's last phone call, broke down in front of the pyre and tried to embrace his son one last time. Amid rising anger over the incident, the minister and his son have both denied being present at the Lakhimpur Kheri site. A viral video, apparently of the incident, has surfaced and has been tweeted by BJP MP Varun Gandhi and Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, among others. The video apparently shows the horrifying moment when an SUV drove into a group of protesters from behind and crushed many of them. Unconfirmed reports suggest the post-mortem report of all eight bodies has revealed the cause of death as injuries, shock and brain haemorrhage.   Families have demanded action based on the videos that have emerged after the incident. The body of one of the farmers, who allegedly died of a gunshot wound, will be sent for a second post mortem as part of a truce that facilitated the cremations.  "

On an order of the Calcutta High Court, the CBI and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the West Bengal Police are currently probing incidents of violence that took place after the assembly election results were announced on May 2. It has been alleged that TMC workers had attacked BJP activists and their family members. The Union law minister came to north Bengal to take part in the BJP's public outreach programme 'Seva aur Samarpan Abhiyan'. He cleaned a road with a broom at Jalpaiguri town. ""Have you seen any state where the government machinery is not doing its job while the (ruling) political party is taking over it?

The development process in the region got momentum with improvement in connectivity during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at the Centre but it was interrupted after the Congress-led UPA came to power in 2004, Mr Rijiju said.   He said the development of the North-eastern states is on the priority list of the current BJP-led NDA government. The Union law minister said the Centre is keen on boosting infrastructure for the judiciary to make sure that poor people can get justice."

However, there was no statement on the issue by the authorities. The AAP in a tweet claimed that Mr Singh was arrested along with other leaders. ""Sanjay Singh was in custody in Biswan for 43 hours,"" the party claimed and added that its workers took out a demonstration in Sitapur's Biswan demanding justice for the farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. Mr Singh tweeted saying that AAP leaders were not allowed to meet the victims' families. ""Leader of Opposition in Punjab Harpal Singh Cheema, party's Punjab co-incharge Raghav Chadha and MLA Baljinder Kaur, Kultar Singh, Amarjit Sandhawa, UP president Sabhajit Singh have been arrested in Lakhimpur Police Lines,"" Mr Singh said on Twitter and also posted some pictures of the leaders staging the dharna on a road. Mr Singh, joined by his party workers, was sitting on a 'dharna' in Biswan since the state police stopped him while he was en route to Lakhimpur Kheri in the early hours of Monday. Earlier in the day, Mr Singh had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Lakhimpur Kheri and meet the family members of the farmers there. In a letter, the AAP leader also urged the prime minister to take along with him leaders of all political parties. ""I would urge you with folded hands that in this great hour of grief and sorrow, you should change your intention of organising any festival and visit Lakhimpur Kheri with the leaders of all the parties to meet family members of the farmers who were brutally crushed under the car of your minister and murdered for no reason,"" Mr Singh said in his letter. ""Sitting among those families, you should repent, apologise, sack your minister immediately, arrest the culprits and being the head of the council of ministers, take the responsibility for this incident... Not only UP but the whole country is also immersed in mourning and shock, how can you celebrate a festival,"" he questioned PM Modi. The remarks came at a time the prime minister was in Lucknow to inaugurate the 'Azadi@75 - New Urban India: Transforming Urban Landscape' conference-cum-expo and also to launch development projects. Eight people died and several others were injured on Sunday in the bloodiest clash since the farmers' protest began last year over the Centre agri laws. Four of the dead were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya.   There were two BJP workers, a local journalist and a Union minister's driver, allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and then lynched by the protesters. Two cars were set on fire.

Meanwhile, the Madras High Court has asked the Forest Department to let only a few people enter the forest for its capture while stressing the need to respect the tiger's right to roam free in the wild. The court told the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to use his best discretion to ensure that very few people intrude the forest since the natural habitat is destroyed the moment a large posse of humans set foot in them while searching for the tiger named ""T23"", which has killed four persons, cows and a goat so far. However, the authorities are free to deal with the animal for its treatment and for ascertaining its conduct and behaviour, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice PD Audikesavalu said. The bench was passing interim orders on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition from Sangeetha Dogra of Noida Extension in Uttar Pradesh. The petition prayed for a direction to the Forest department to ensure that the tiger, perceived to be dangerous to humans, is captured alive and no steps are taken to put it to sleep or otherwise kill it. ""All that can be said at the moment is that the other animals in the area should not be disturbed to the extent avoidable for the purpose of tracking down this animal, though some discreet measures may be used for such purpose with the object of ultimately treating the animal and respecting its right to remain wild and free to roam in the forest,"" the bench said. Earlier, government counsel P Muthukumar told the judges there is no plan to kill the animal or maim it. Efforts are on to capture the animal alive and study its psychology and behaviour to assess what future course of treatment may be adopted.   The bench has asked for a status report to be filed when the matter appears after the reopening of the court following the Dussehra vacation on October 21, the bench added. While efforts are on to trap the injured animal, it has given the slip to nearly 100 forest department staff and officials, including some from the Special Task Force from Kerala and tamed elephants for over a week now."

The hardline Islamist movement declared a new regime after overrunning the capital in August and ousting the US-backed government. But after 20 years of war the aid-reliant country faces economic collapse, with major donors pausing funding and no emergency support in place. The new rulers have been courting hesitant foreign powers in a bid to restart cash flows to the country, where civil servants and healthcare workers have gone months without salaries. Taliban tweeted pictures of the first meeting between Simon Gass, Britain's special representative for Afghanistan, and deputy prime ministers Abdul Ghani Baradar and Abdul Salam Hanafi. The two sides discussed how Britain can help Afghanistan battle terrorism and a deepening humanitarian crisis -- and provide safe passage for those who want to leave the country, a UK government spokesperson said. ""They also raised the treatment of minorities and the rights of women and girls,"" the spokesperson added, saying Gass was joined by Martin Longden, charge d'affaires at the now evacuated UK mission to Afghanistan. The Taliban, notorious for their brutal and oppressive rule from 1996 to 2001, have faced a backlash after effectively excluding women and girls from education and work across the country. Calls for inclusivity Abdul Qahar Balkhi, the Taliban's foreign ministry spokesman, said the meeting ""focused on detailed discussions about reviving diplomatic relations between both countries"". Western governments have warned that the Taliban must form an ""inclusive"" government and respect women's rights if they are to be formally recognised. Neighbouring Pakistan however has been pushing for the international community to engage with the new rulers and help stabilise a country threatened by famine. The Taliban have made some gestures towards international respectability, while insisting on their right to return to a government based on their hardline interpretation of Islamic law. On Tuesday girls returned to some secondary schools in a northern province, Taliban officials and teachers said, despite them remaining barred from classrooms in much of the country. A video posted by the group's spokesman Suhail Shaheen showed dozens of schoolgirls in black, some wearing white head scarves and others with black face veils, sat in chairs waving Taliban flags. But education ministry official Mohammad Abid said there had been no policy change from the interim central government, telling AFP on Tuesday: ""High schools still remain closed for girls."" The Taliban, which have permitted girls to attend primary school, have said girls will return to secondary schools once their security and strict gender segregation under sharia law can be ensured. Several teachers and a head teacher in Kunduz city, the provincial capital, told AFP that girls at high schools in some districts had gone back to classes. The Taliban also announced at a stage-managed rally that some women civil servants have been called back to work, in signs the Islamists may be trying to soften their public image after 50 days in power. Interior ministry spokesman Qari Sayed Khosti told AFP that all staff of the passport department ""including female employees"" were asked to return to their offices. Hazara 'abuses' Meanwhile, a report from Amnesty International on Tuesday warned that the Taliban's brutal abuses and repression of minorities during their first stint in power could be repeated. The rights group said it had determined that Taliban forces killed 13 ethnic Hazara in the central Daykundi province on August 30, in what it said ""appear to be war crimes"". Eleven of those killed were former government soldiers, and Amnesty said witnesses saw nine of them executed after they surrendered. Two civilians, including a 17-year-old girl, were also killed in the crossfire.   ""These cold-blooded executions are further proof that the Taliban are committing the same horrific abuses they were notorious for during their previous rule of Afghanistan,"" Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement.

Mr Shringla called on President Rajapaksa before he wrapped up his four-day visit to the island nation to review the bilateral ties. The meeting took place a day after the president returned from the US, after attending the annual UN General Assembly. ""Sri Lanka would not be allowed to be used for any activity that could pose a threat to India's security,"" President Rajpaksa conveyed it to Mr Shringla during the meeting, a presidential release said. President Rajapaksa explained the nature of Sri Lanka's relationship with China ""in a comprehensive manner and informed the Indian Foreign Secretary not to have any doubts about it,"" it said. China has been ramping up its presence in Sri Lanka, investing billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects, including ports. Beijing is also providing financial assistance to Sri Lanka as its economy struggles under the strain of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sri Lanka is also key to China's Belt and Road initiative (BRI), an ambitious infrastructure project that aims to expand the country's influence and global trade links. A strategic port that was built by Chinese companies at Hambantota - which Sri Lanka was not able to repay and therefore handed over to Beijing in 2017 on a 99-year lease - has enhanced Beijing's presence on the island. India is also concerned over China's plans to build a brand new city with Chinese money off the coast of Colombo on reclaimed land. President Rajapaksa told Mr Shringla that Indian investors are invited to invest in the island and Sri Lanka was keen to resolve the situation regarding the Trincomalee oil tanks in a manner that is beneficial to both countries. The World War II-era oil storage facility in the strategically advantaged port district of Trincomalee has been a key bilateral economic partnership link for decades. Since 2003, the Sri Lankan subsidiary of India's oil major Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the Lanka IOC, has had the leasing rights to 99 tanks at the facility for a period of 35 years, for an annual payment of USD 100,000. Mr Shringla's visit to the site on Sunday assumes significance as oil sector trade unions in Sri Lanka have demanded that tanks be brought under the control of the state fuel entity Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). President Rajapaksa tweeted that he had a fruitful discussion with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla. ""Both agreed on the need for strengthening the lasting bond b/w 2 countries. I invited Indian investors to come to #SriLanka, while we discussed tourism, power generation & post-pandemic economy revival,"" he said. The Sri Lankan President elaborated on the need to re-establish the friendship and relations between India and Sri Lanka that existed in the 1960s and 70s. President Rajapaksa said that he is expecting to obtain India's support in advancing the 1971 proposal to declare the Indian Ocean a peace zone. The long standing problems faced by the fishermen of the two countries could be resolved by identifying immediate solutions to the existing problems and providing the benefits rightfully owed by the fishing community, the release said. On India's concerns over the 13th amendment, President Rajapaksa pointed out the urgent need to understand the weaknesses as well as the strengths of the 13th Amendment. Mr Shringla, in his meetings with the Tamil minority parties, had stressed the Indian commitment to the 13th Amendment as a means to bring about reconciliation in Sri Lanka. India has been consistently calling upon Sri Lanka to fulfill its commitments to protect the interests of the Tamil community and preserve the island nation's character as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society. The 13th Amendment provides for devolution of power to the Tamil community. India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement the 13th amendment which was brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987. A release from the Indian High Commission said the Foreign Secretary underscored the importance India attaches to expeditiously taking forward mutually beneficial projects, including proposals to enhance air and sea connectivity between India and Sri Lanka. Earlier, the High Commission of India (HCI), giving details of the meeting, said in a tweet, ""they reaffirmed the strong ties of friendship & cooperation between India & Sri Lanka and discussed ways to further advance this comprehensive partnership at all levels."" In all his engagements, Mr Shringla underscored India's willingness to pursue economic and commercial ties between the two countries and post pandemic economic recovery by taking forward joint projects of mutual benefit was emphasised, officials said. The Indian High Commission said that the foreign secretary's visit involving notable engagements in Colombo, Kandy, Trincomalee and Jaffna was ""productive"". ""His visit will give further impetus and momentum to India-Sri Lanka ties,"" it said in a tweet. On Monday, Mr Shringla had a ""productive discussion"" with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on further consolidating the multifaceted bilateral partnership. He also met Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa and Foreign Minister GL Peiris and discussed bilateral ties in all spheres. He also held delegation-level meetings with his Lankan counterpart Admiral (Retd) Prof. Jayanath Colombage on Monday. during which they reviewed bilateral cooperation. The Foreign Secretary also interacted with the Indian High Commission officers at the Mission premises on Tuesday.   ""Team HCI is truly grateful for his words of encouragement and support,"" the Indian High Commission said in another tweet.

The top court said that an old saying -- spare the rod and spoil the child -- may have lost its relevance in present days and Corporal punishment to the child is not recognised by law but that does not mean that a teacher or school authorities have to shut their eyes to any indiscipline act of a student. The top court said it is a solemn duty of a teacher to instill discipline in the students and reprimanding a student for not being attentive or not being up to the mark in studies or for bunking classes or not attending the school is not uncommon. The observations were made by the top court while quashing an FIR against a school teacher accused under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code for abatement of the suicide of a Class 9 student. ""The disciplinary measures adopted by a teacher or other authorities of a school, reprimanding a student for his indiscipline, in our considered opinion, would not tantamount to provoking a student to commit suicide unless there are repeated specific allegations of harassment and insult deliberately without any justifiable cause or reason,"" a bench of Justices SA Nazeer and Krishna Murari said The bench set aside an order of Rajasthan High Court which refused to quash an FIR against a Physical Training (PT) teacher who was accused of abatement of the suicide of the student, The top court said a simple act of reprimand of a student for his behaviour or indiscipline by a teacher, who is under moral obligations to inculcate the good qualities of a human being in a student would definitely not amount to instigation or intentionally aid to the commission of suicide by a student. ""It is not only a moral duty of a teacher but one of the legally assigned duties under Section 24 (e) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 to hold regular meetings with the parents and guardians and apprise them about the regularity in attendance, ability to learn, progress made in learning and any other act or relevant information about the child,"" the bench said. The court said that for alleged abetment of suicide under Section 306 IPC there must be an allegation of either direct or indirect act of incitement to the commission of the offence of suicide. It said mere allegations of harassment of the dead by another person would not be sufficient in itself, unless, there are allegations of such actions on the part of the accused which compelled the commission of suicide. ""Further, if the person committing suicide is hypersensitive and the allegations attributed to the accused is otherwise not ordinarily expected to induce a similarly situated person to take the extreme step of committing suicide, it would be unsafe to hold the accused guilty of abetment of suicide,"" the bench said. The court said that what is required is an examination of every case on its own facts and circumstances and keeping in consideration the surrounding circumstances as well, which may have bearing on the alleged action of the accused and the psyche of the dead. The top court was hearing an appeal filed by Geo Varghese against an order passed by the Rajasthan High Court dismissing the petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking to quash the FIR at Police Station Sodala, Jaipur City (South) against him under section 306 IPC The accused, a Physical Training Teacher in St. Xavier's School, Nevta, Jaipur, and also a member of the Disciplinary Committee for maintaining overall discipline by the students of the School, was charged for an offence under Section 306 (abatement of suicide) Indian Penal Code. The appellant was appointed as a Physical Training Teacher in St. Xavier's School, Nevta in the year 2016. He was also a member of the Disciplinary Committee for maintaining overall discipline by the students of the School. One student of Class 9th of the institution, unfortunately, committed suicide in the morning on April 26, 2018. The mother of the student who died lodged the FIR in question on May 2, 2018, before the concerned Police Station under Section 306 IPC after about 7 days of the suicide, alleging that her son committed suicide due to mental harassment meted out by the appellant. The top court noted that in the First Information Report and as also the statement of the complainant recorded by the police, no reasons or cause for the accused teacher to harass and insult the victim are spelled out. ""The appellant having found the deceased boy regularly bunking classes, first reprimanded him but on account of repeated acts, brought this fact to the knowledge of the Principal, who called the parents on the telephone to come to the school.   ""No further overt act has been attributed to the appellant either in the First Information Report or in the statement of the complainant, or anything in this regard has been stated in the alleged suicide note,"" the bench said. Even the suicide note does not attribute any act or instigation on the part of the appellant to connect him with the offence for which he is being charged, it said."

Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the incident on Sunday. The video, being shared widely on social media, is yet to be verified by the police. NDTV cannot independently verify its authenticity. It is also not clear from the visuals who is in the driving seat. Earlier today, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted the viral clip with a pointed question for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""@narendramodi Sir, your government has kept me in custody for the last 28 hours without any order and FIR. This person who crushed the annadata (farmers) has not been arrested yet. Why?"" tweeted Priyanka Gandhi this morning. In the 25-second video clip, the SUV rams protesters, who fall to the ground, while others scramble to get out of the way. Another vehicle, with sirens blaring, is seen tailing the SUV that hit the farmers. The video matches descriptions given to NDTV on Sunday by farmers at the spot, who said the car suddenly hit them from behind. The make and colour of the lead SUV that hits the farmers also matches other visuals from the site. The farmers have alleged that the protesters were run over by an SUV driven by Union Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra's son Ashish Mishra. Both the Minister and his son have denied even being at the spot. The incident took place when a group of protesting farmers in Tikonia area of Kheri tried to block Mr Mishra and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya from visiting. The protesters were upset over a recent speech by Mr Mishra. The farmers claimed the violence broke out after a car in the minister's convoy ran over protesters. Visuals from the area showed arson and vehicles set on fire. A murder case has been filed against the Union minister's son.   Minister Ajay Mishra says he is not aware about any FIR against his son. He has also denied that his son was linked to the violence. ""My son wasn't present at the spot. There were miscreants who attacked workers with sticks and swords. Had my son been there, he wouldn't have come out alive,"" Mr Mishra, the junior Home Minister, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

Ben Slater, 37, departed on a flight to Doha with top British envoys who had visited for talks with senior Taliban officials. The Sun tabloid reported that Slater's evacuation was directly supervised by the British defence minister Ben Wallace. Slater, a former soldier in the Royal Military Police, runs a chain of NGOs in Afghanistan, according to The Daily Telegraph. The Taliban briefly detained him last month as he was trying to evacuate his 400 Afghan staff overland to Pakistan after failing to secure places for them on a British airlift. He was questioned over why single women were staying in hotels without husbands. The Islamists then released Slater but said he could only take one staff member across the land border while ordering the others to return to Kabul.   Slater urged the Foreign Office in London to help evacuate his staff from the country after a ""complete disaster"" at the border.

The country's media regulator Roskomnadzor said that it had drawn up a new protocol to penalise the US social media giant for repeatedly failing ""to remove information dangerous to citizens"" on Facebook and Instagram. It said the fine calls for a total of ""5 to 10 percent"" of Facebook's ""annual revenue"" -- though it did not specify whether it meant revenue earned in Russia or worldwide. According to the Vedomosti business daily, Facebook earns tens of billions of rubles in Russia per year. Roskomnadzor said a court will determine when to set the hearing. ""The exact amount of the fine will also be determined by the court,"" the media regulator said in a statement. Russia regularly takes legal action against internet platforms for not removing content it labels illegal, such as pornographic material or posts condoning drugs and suicide. The country has already fined Facebook 90 million rubles ($1 million) for various penalties, according to Russian news agencies, including not deleting banned content. Russia this year has also been tightening controls over US-based tech companies, accusing them of interfering in the country's internal affairs. In January, Russia demanded that social networks take down posts calling on Russians to join protests in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, under the guise of preventing minors from attending. President Vladimir Putin that month complained of the growing influence of large tech companies, which he said were competing with sovereign states.   Last month authorities accused US social media companies of interfering in parliamentary elections and summoned the US ambassador in Moscow.

Frances Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team, said the social media giant keeps its algorithms and operations a secret. ""The core of the issue is that no one can understand Facebook's destructive choices better than Facebook, because only Facebook gets to look under the hood,"" she said in written testimony prepared for the hearing. ""A critical starting point for effective regulation is transparency,"" she said in testimony to be delivered to a Senate Commerce subcommittee. ""On this foundation, we can build sensible rules and standards to address consumer harms, illegal content, data protection, anticompetitive practices, algorithmic systems and more."" In an era when bipartisanship is rare on Capitol Hill, the top Democrat and Republican on the subcommittee agreed on the need for big changes at Facebook. Subcommittee chair Richard Blumenthal noted that Facebook's leadership had rejected recommendations made to make its sites, which include Instagram, safer. ""There are a lot of teens who are looking in the mirror right now and feeling bad about their self image and their bodies. Mark Zuckerberg should be looking in the mirror,"" he said in a television interview on Tuesday. The top Republican, Marsha Blackburn, is expected to say in opening remarks that Facebook turned a blind eye to children below age 13 on its sites. ""It is clear that Facebook prioritizes profit over the well-being of our children."" Haugen came forward this week to reveal she was the one who provided documents used in a Wall Street Journal investigation and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teen girls. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. The Journal's stories showed the company contributed to increased polarization online when it made changes to its content algorithm; failed to take steps to reduce vaccine hesitancy; and was aware that Instagram harmed the mental health of teenage girls. Haugen said Facebook had also done too little to prevent its platform from being used by people planning violence.   Facebook was used by people planning mass killings in Myanmar and the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump who were determined to toss out the 2020 election results.

Ashish Mishra, who has been accused of murder and negligence in the FIR, is yet to be arrested. The police have attributed the delay to their being preoccupied with multiple issues including ""negotiations with farmers, postmortems and cremations"".

""The incident took place around 3 pm, when Ashish Mishra with his three vehicles along with 15-20 men with weapons moved towards Banwaripur meeting place...

The minister's son, the FIR added, then got off and fled into the sugarcane field, continuing to fire from his gun. Five people had died in this alleged attack, which triggered violence and arson by the furious farmers. The violence cost another three lives. The postmortem report of the people who initially died, lists the cause of death as injuries, shock and brain haemorrhage. Following days of negotiations, three of the bodies were cremated this afternoon after the police agreed to conduct a second postmortem of the alleged gunshot victim. The farmers were holding out for a postmortem examination at a Delhi hospital, but have agreed to have it at Bahraich. The examination, however, will be conducted by doctors from Lucknow. Ajay Mishra, who is the junior home minister at the Centre, and his son have denied that they were at the spot. The minister, though, has admitted that the vehicle belongs to him.

He was immediately rushed to a hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival. The police and security forces rushed to the spot but his attackers had already escaped. The area around his pharmacy has been sealed off and a search operation is underway, the police said. A Kashmiri Pandit, Bindroo remained in Kashmir and ran his pharmacy even at the peak of terrorism in the 1990s.

In an order issued recently, the state has made wearing of masks and carrying of hand sanitisers mandatory for all revellers, while also underlining that cultural programmes will not be allowed anywhere near the marquees. ""In the context of the pandemic and the need to have physical distancing norms, the state immersion carnival shall not be held this year. In a similar vein, melas, carnivals near puja pandals shall not be allowed (sic),"" the order stated. It has asked organisers to ensure that pandals are kept open on all sides. ""All pandals must have adequate space and arrangements for ensuring physical distancing .. There should be separate entry and exit arrangements. There must be floor marking and other signages (sic),"" the order said. People should be encouraged to ""offer anjali (prayers) with flowers brought from homes"" to avoid congestion at the pandals, it maintained. ""Keeping in view the safety of participants and organisers, anjali, distribution of prasad, or sindoor khela should be organised by puja committee in a planned manner and in smaller groups,"" the order stressed. It has also directed puja organisers to keep inaugurations, and award-distribution programmes ""low key"". ""Ideally all visits for judging pandals should be virtual, and physical visits should be made during the lean hours, between 10 am and 3 pm,"" the state government said in its 11-point order. The government has further asked the organisers to make its arrangements in advance so as to facilitate visits to pandal premises from Tritiya (third day of the 10-day festival) for catching a glimpse of the goddess. The Calcutta High Court, much like last year, has barred entry of people inside pandals. Kolkata police commissioner Soumen Mitra on Tuesday visited a few renowned puja pandals here to check if the preparations made by the organisers are in tune with the government guidelines. ""The state government has issued a notification which all puja organisers must follow. I am visiting pandals to oversee the arrangements... to check if the COVID protocols are being adhered to. So far, it seems everything is fine,"" Mitra said. The government, in its bid to give puja preparations a boost, has offered a slew of concessions to the organisers. According to a senior official, the fire department would not be charging any fee for setting up safety measures in the marquees, and the civic bodies, too, would ""provide their services free of cost"". The state is providing a one-time financial assistance of ₹ 50,000 to each puja committee to help them make requisite arrangements amid the pandemic. The government has sanctioned a sum of ₹ 201 crore for the purpose, the official said.   Altogether 40,382 clubs, 3,700 of them under Kolkata Police jurisdiction and the rest under West Bengal Police, would be getting the grant, he added.

But what actually caused the outage? What does Facebook say happened? In an apologetic blog post, Santosh Janardhan, Facebook's vice president of infrastructure, said that ""configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centres caused issues that interrupted this communication"". Can you explain that in plain English? Cyber experts think the problem boils down to something called BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol -- the system the internet uses to pick the quickest route to move packets of information around. Sami Slim of data centre company Telehouse compared BGP to ""the internet equivalent of air traffic control"". In the same way that air traffic controllers sometimes make changes to flight schedules, ""Facebook did an update of these routes,"" Slim said. But this update contained a crucial error. It's not yet clear how or why, but Facebook's routers essentially sent a message to the internet announcing that the company's servers no longer existed. Why did it take so long to fix the problem? Experts say Facebook's technical infrastructure is unusually reliant on its own systems -- and that proved disastrous on Monday. After Facebook sent the fateful routing update, its engineers got locked out of the system that would allow them to communicate that the update had, in fact, been an error. So they couldn't fix the problem. ""Normally it's good not to put all your eggs in one basket,"" said Pierre Bonis of AFNIC, the association that manages domain names in France. ""For security reasons, Facebook has had to very strongly concentrate its infrastructure,"" he said. ""That streamlines things on a daily basis -- but because everything is in the same place, when that place has a problem, nothing works."" The knock-on effects of the shutdown included some Facebook employees being unable to even enter their buildings because their security badges no longer worked, further slowing the response. Is this unprecedented? Social media outages are not uncommon: Instagram alone has experienced more than 80 in the past year in the United States, according to website builder ToolTester. This week's Facebook outage was rare in its length and scale, however. There is also a precedent for BGP meddling being at the root of a social media shutdown. In 2008, when a Pakistani internet service provider was attempting to block YouTube for domestic users, it inadvertently shut down the global website for several hours. And the outage's impact? Between Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, ""billions of users have been impacted by the services being entirely offline"", the Downdetector tracking service said. Facebook, whose shares fell nearly five percent over the outage, has stressed there is ""no evidence that user data was compromised as a result of this downtime"". But even though it lasted just a few hours, the impact of the shutdown ran deep. Facebook's services are crucial for many businesses around the world, and users complained of being cut off from their livelihoods. Facebook accounts are also commonly used to log in to other websites, which faced additional problems due to the company's technical meltdown. Rival instant messaging services meanwhile reported that they had benefited from the fact that WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger were down. Telegram went from the 56th most downloaded free app in the US to the fifth, according to monitoring firm SensorTower, while Signal tweeted that ""millions"" of new users had joined. And among the more curious side-effects, several domain name registration companies listed Facebook.com as available for purchase.   ""There was never any reason to believe Facebook.com would actually be sold as a result, but it's fun to consider how many billions of dollars it could fetch on the open market,"" said cyber security expert Brian Krebs.

However, the minister said neither he nor his son was present at the spot when the incident happened. ""From Day One, we have been clear that the [Mahindra] Thar is ours, which is registered in our name. And the vehicle was going to receive someone after picking up our workers. Our son was at another venue. From 11 am till the evening, he was organising another event. My son was present there, there were thousands there. There are photos and videos. If you take out his call records and CDR, location... can check all. Thousands of people are willing to give an affidavit also that Ashish Mishra was there,"" Ajay Mishra told NDTV in an interview. ""As far as the vehicle is concerned, I was clear that my driver was killed, two workers were killed. One worker escaped, three workers are injured, and after that, the car stopped there. After that, the car was pushed and the vehicle and another Fortuner was burnt. Such people can't be farmers. These are extremists hidden amongst farmers,"" he said. The minister's clarification came on a day when a video, purportedly of the minister's SUV running over slogan-shouting farmers marching in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri, was widely shared on social media including by Varun Gandhi, an MP of the ruling BJP. The video, being shared widely on social media, is yet to be verified by the police. NDTV cannot independently verify its authenticity. It is also not clear from the visuals who is in the driving seat. The farmers have alleged that the protesters were run over by an SUV driven by Ashish Mishra. The incident took place when a group of protesting farmers in the Tikonia area of Kheri tried to block Mr Mishra and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya from visiting. The protesters were upset over a recent speech by Mr Mishra. Asked about the speech in which he had said ""Face me, it will take just two minutes to discipline you fellows"", which seems to have angered the farmers before Sunday's violence, Ajay Mishra said his comments were misunderstood. ""If you look at the full speech, it was given in a gathering of farmers. On September 25, in front of a gurudwara, I had made that speech in a gathering of farmers and in that, I had spoken of people who tore the posters at night, and it was said that these people can't be farmers. Who tore the pictures of Bharat Mata, the PM, our hoardings before a Kisan sammelan? They are rowdy, violent. And there should be action against these violent people. That's what I said, that you better reform, or else the state and the administration will fix you through its laws,"" Mr Mishra said. The minister declined to say if he had been questioned by the police.   Speaking about his son's name in the FIR, he said, ""Police did not add his name to FIR. They were made to add by people who gave the complaint. In the complaint, he is mentioned. This is a matter of investigation, it will all get clear after investigation. I have clearly told you we have proof. It is not without evidence that we are saying. There is a 3-4 km distance between the site of the incident and the event venue. He was continuously at the event venue. He did not go to the scene, neither did I."" Mr Mishra denied he was under any kind of pressure to step down after the incident. ""Why would I [resign]? There is no pressure on us, We will investigate this, and those involved, who conspired, will take action against them,"" he said."

Already in 2018, 3.6 billion people had inadequate access to water for at least one month per year, said a new report from the UN's World Meteorological Organization. ""We need to wake up to the looming water crisis,"" said WMO chief Petteri Taalas. ""The State of Climate Services 2021: Water"" report comes just weeks before COP26 -- the UN Climate Change Conference being held in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12. The WMO stressed that over the last 20 years, the levels of water stored on land -- on the surface, in the subsurface, in snow and ice -- had dropped at a rate of one centimetre per year. The biggest losses are in Antarctica and Greenland, but many highly-populated lower latitude locations are experiencing significant water losses in areas that traditionally provide water supply, said the WMO. The agency said there were major ramifications for water security, as only 0.5 percent of water on Earth is useable and available fresh water. ""Increasing temperatures are resulting in global and regional precipitation changes, leading to shifts in rainfall patterns and agricultural seasons, with a major impact on food security and human health and well-being,"" said Taalas. - 'We cannot wait' - Meanwhile water-related hazards have increased in frequency over the past 20 years. Since 2000, flood-related disasters have risen by 134 percent compared with the previous two decades. ""We have seven percent more humidity in the atmosphere because of the current warming and that's also contributing to the flooding,"" Taalas told a press conference. Most of the flood-related deaths and economic losses were recorded in Asia, where river flood warning systems require strengthening, said the WMO. At the same time, there has been around a 30 percent increase in the amount and duration of drought events since 2000, with Africa the worst-affected continent. Taalas urged countries at COP26 to raise their game. He said most world leaders were talking about climate change as a major risk to the welfare of mankind, but their actions were not matching their words. ""We cannot wait for decades to start acting,"" he said. ""That's also a message for countries like China which has said that they would like to become carbon neutral by 2060 but they don't have a concrete plan for the coming decade.""   He said the top priority at COP26 was stepping up ambition levels in climate mitigation, but more work was also needed on climate adaptations, as the negative trend in weather patterns will continue for the coming decades -- and the coming centuries when it comes to the melting of glaciers and sea levels rising.

The police have told the media that the case against her and 10 others relates to preventive detention due to apprehension of breach of peace. Ms Gandhi Vadra had intended to visit the families of farmers, who died on Sunday, allegedly mowed down by a vehicle driven by the son of Union Minister Ajay Mishra. The violence that followed had claimed the lives of another four persons. The state police, which had placed the area under a security blanket since, arrested Ms Gandhi Vadra and Deepender Hooda the next morning after a huge, dramatic confrontation. Since then, she has been lodged at the PAC (Provincial Arms Constabulary) Guest House, from where her team released visuals of her sweeping the floor. At the time of her arrest, prohibitory orders under Section 144, which bars the gathering of more than four persons, had been declared in Lakhimpur Kheri. But Ms Gandhi Vadra said to her knowledge, it was not in place in Sitapur, from where she was arrested. ""I was, in any case, traveling in a single vehicle with four other persons, two local Congress workers, Mr. Deepender Singh Hooda MP and Mr Sandeep Singh. No security car or Congress workers other than the four persons accompanying me were with me,"" read her statement. ""I have myself seen a portion of a paper on social media in which they have named 11 people - 8 of whom were not even present at the time I was arrested. In fact, they have even named the two persons who brought my clothes from Lucknow on the 4th afternoon,"" the statement added. Several Congress and other opposition leaders have termed her arrest illegal. Contending that her arrest violates her constitutional rights, along with several provisions of the CrPC, senior advocate and Congress leader P Chidambaram said, ""The arresting police officer told her she was arrested under Section 151 of the CrPC. Any person arrested under Section 151 cannot be detained for more than 24 hours unless there is an order of the judicial magistrate under any other provision of law"". Through Monday and Tuesday, the UP police has not allowed any opposition leaders in the area. Earlier today Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel was not allowed to step out of the Lucknow airport. A team of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party was detained. Punjab Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was also not allowed to visit the area, gave an ultimatum today. Mr Sidhu said the Punjab Congress will lead a march to Lakhimpur Kheri if the accused is not arrested, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is not released.   Earlier, Ms Gandhi Vadra questioned why the opposition leaders are being arrested when the accused - Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra - is roaming free. ""Why is the opposition arrested without any order and a man who has committed such a horrendous crime... he is not arrested? PM Modi, arrest him, not people like us,"" Priyanka Gandhi told NDTV from the guest house in Sitapur."

Ex-employee Frances Haugen testified on Capitol Hill after she leaked reams of internal research to authorities and The Wall Street Journal, which has fueled one of Facebook's most serious crises yet. ""I believe that Facebook's products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy,"" Haugen told a Senate sub-committee. ""Congressional action is needed. They won't solve this crisis without your help,"" she added. In her testimony, she noted the danger of the power in the hands of a service that is woven into the daily lives of so many people. ""The company intentionally hides vital information from the public, from the US government and from governments around the world,"" Haugen's statement said. She spoke less than a day after Facebook, its photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp went offline for roughly seven hours, hitting potentially billions of users and highlighting global dependence on its services. ""Here's my message for (Facebook CEO) Mark Zuckerberg. Your time of invading our privacy, promoting toxic content and preying on children and teens is over,"" said Senator Ed Markey. ""Congress will be taking action... we will not allow your company to harm our children, our families and our democracy anymore,"" he added. Senator Amy Klobuchar said she sees the whistleblower disclosures as the long-needed push to get Congress moving. ""I think the time has come for action, and I think you are the catalyst for that action,"" she told Haugen. US lawmakers for years have threatened to regulate Facebook and other social media platforms to address criticisms that the tech giants trample on privacy, provide a megaphone for dangerous misinformation and damage young people's well-being. Facebook has pushed back hard against the whistleblower revelations and attacked Haugen's knowledge on Tuesday. Haugen ""did not work on child safety or Instagram or research these issues and has no direct knowledge of the topic from her work at Facebook,"" tweeted Andy Stone, a spokesman for the company. - 'I love Instagram' - Haugen, a 37-year-old data scientist from Iowa, has worked for companies including Google and Pinterest -- but said in an interview Sunday with CBS news show ""60 Minutes"" that Facebook was ""substantially worse"" than anything she had seen before. Facebook's vice president of policy and global affairs Nick Clegg vehemently pushed back at the assertion its platforms are ""toxic"" for teens, days after a tense, hours-long congressional hearing in which US lawmakers grilled the company over its impact on the mental health of young users. Facebook late Monday blamed the outage on configuration changes it made to routers that coordinate network traffic between its data centers. ""This disruption to network traffic had a cascading effect on the way our data centers communicate, bringing our services to a halt,"" Facebook vice president of infrastructure Santosh Janardhan said in a post. In addition to the disruption to people, businesses and others that rely on the company's tools, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took a financial hit. Fortune's billionaire tracking website late Monday said Zuckerberg's personal fortune plunged by nearly $6 billion from the prior day to land at just under $117 billion. Some people rejoiced at Facebook's tools being offline, but some complained to AFP that the outage had caused trouble for them both professionally and personally. ""I love Instagram. It's the app I use the most, especially for my job,"" said Millie Donnelly, community manager for a non-profit.   ""So professionally, it's definitely a step back and then personally, I just am always on the app."" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

In a letter written to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the Congress had said a five-member delegation led by Rahul Gandhi planned to visit the district. It also called the detention of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra ""without any reason or justification"". A delegation of Rahul Gandhi, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Channi, party leader KC Venugopal and Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot will reach state capital Lucknow around 1:30 pm. The permission for the visit was denied soon after with the state government citing orders banning large gatherings, news agency ANI reported. Ms Gandhi Vadra, a Congress general secretary, on Tuesday alleged that she was being held illegally at a police compound in Sitapur and no notice or FIR has been provided to her even after her 38-hour detention and was not allowed to meet her legal counsel. In a statement, she said she has not been produced in front of a magistrate or any other judicial officer and neither has she been allowed to meet her legal counsel, who has been standing at the gate of the compound since morning. ""Presently I am not going into the details of the completely illegal physical force used on my colleagues and me at the time of my arrest as this statement serves merely to clarify the continuing illegality of my confinement at the PAC compound in Sitapur, UP,"" she said. ""I have not been served with any order or notice. Nor have they shown me an FIR. I have not been produced in front of a magistrate or any other judicial officer either. I have also not been allowed to meet my legal counsel who has been standing at the gate since morning,"" the Congress leader also said. Ms Gandhi Vadra has been kept in detention since Monday morning after she wanted to meet the families of the victims of the Lakhimpur clashes. She said she has seen a portion of a paper on social media in which the authorities have named 11 people, including eight who were not even present at the time she was arrested. They have even named the two persons ""who brought my clothes from Lucknow on the afternoon of October 4"", she said.   Eight people were killed on Sunday as violence erupted during a farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri, claiming the lives of both farmers and BJP workers ahead of a visit by UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. Four of the dead were people in the cars, apparently part of a convoy of BJP workers who had come to welcome the UP minister and were attacked after allegedly running over the protesting farmers."

In the first half of the session, benchmarks fluctuated between gains and losses owing to weak global cues. However, late buying in index heavyweights like Reliance Industries, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel and HDFC Bank lifted the benchmarks. The Sensex advanced 446 points to close at 59,745 and Nifty 50 index rose 131 points to settle at 17,822. Hopes of strong September quarter earnings, which will start with IT giant TCS and continuation of dovish monetary policy from the Reserve Bank of India lifted investors' sentiment, analysts said. ""If Nifty is able to sustain above 17800, it can witness higher levels of 18,000.

Mid- and small-cap shares also witnessed buying interest as Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 indexes rose 0.4 per cent. Shares of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea rallied as much as 3.26 per cent and 7 per cent each respectively after the government said it is willing to reconsider one-time spectrum charges (OTSC) of ₹ 40,000 crore levied on telecom companies. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has asked the Supreme Court for three week time to review its decision to penalise telcos - Airtel and Vodafone Idea - for a delay in paying one-time spectrum charges.

IndusInd Bank, Coal India, Indian Oil, SBI Life, Bharti Airtel, HCL Technologies. Reliance Industries, Titan, Bharat Petroleum and Asian Paints also rose 1.7-5 per cent.   On the flipside, Cipla, Hindalco, Shree Cements, Sun Pharma, Tata Consumer Products, Power Grid, Grasim Industries, ITC, UltraTech Cement and Tata Steel were among the losers.

""Why is the opposition arrested without any order and a man who has committed such a horrendous crime... he is not arrested? PM Modi, arrest him, not people like us,"" Priyanka Gandhi told NDTV from a government guest house in Sitapur, where she has been detained since early Monday morning. On Tuesday, Uttar Pradesh officers said a case had been registered against Priyanka Gandhi and others ""related to preventive detention for breach of peace"". But sources close to the Congress leader said she had not been served any order and not shown an FIR either. She was also reportedly not allowed to meet her counsel who had waited ""at the gate"" of the detention centre since morning. According to a list on social media, 11 people have been named in the FIR. The Congress says eight of them were not even present at the time and one man had just brought Priyanka Gandhi's clothes from Lucknow. Earlier today, Priyanka Gandhi said she was ready to stay ""15 days, 20 days, six months or even six years..."" in detention. The Congress leader questioned PM Modi's visit to Lucknow for an event linked to the Independence Day anniversary - ""Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav"". ""Modi-ji is celebrating Azadi (freedom). Who gave us freedom? The farmers gave us freedom. What moral authority do you have to celebrate in Lucknow and not sack your minister and arrest his son?

This person who crushed the annadata (farmers) has not been arrested yet. Why?"" Speaking to NDTV, Priyanka Gandhi said the first thing she would do when released from detention was to meet with the families of the dead farmers. She was heading to Lakhimpur Kheri for the purpose on Sunday night when she was stopped and arrested in the early hours of Monday. Lashing out at the BJP for calling her a political opportunist, Priyanka Gandhi retorted: ""Each person of this country... each child knows who the biggest political opportunist is. They try to undermine us and our politics, saying it is nothing serious. But I am very serious and I work seriously. I don't sit in a jhoola (swing) with the Chinese President. I don't visit Japan... The PM travels the world and he is the biggest tourist.""   She added: ""I belong to a political party that opposes the government. It is my job to raise issues, to stand for people, and to be the voice of the people. Farmers have been protesting for months on end, it is the farmer's son who is protecting our borders. If every opposition party had not tried to visit Lakhimpur Kheri, would the state government have acted at all?"" Priyanka Gandhi also reacted to the Supreme Court yesterday questioning the farmers' protest continuing even after the farm laws that they are opposing have been challenged in court. ""This country is a democracy and the right to protest is a fundamental right of every citizen in the country.  This right is being destroyed in our country under the BJP government,"" she said."

The incident took place when a group of protesting farmers in Tikonia area of Kheri tried to block Mr Mishra and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya from visiting. The protesters were upset over a recent speech by Mr Mishra. The farmers claimed the violence broke out after a car in the minister's convoy ran over protesters.

Addressing a press conference at the Chhattisgarh BJP office Kushabhau Thakre Parisar, she said the Narendra Modi government's development principle is based on empowering people and not only offering entitlements to them. ""The matter of loot never goes out of the mind of the Congress because the same thing was prevalent during their time (rule). Loot in the spectrum, mines, water, they are those who have committed loot. ""The word (loot) is so much in their DNA that they can't think of anything else,"" the Union minister said when asked about the Congress claims that the asset monetisation plan was aimed at ""looting"" the nation. In August, Ms Sitharaman had unveiled a National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) that included unlocking value by involving private companies across infrastructure sectors -- from passenger trains and railway stations to airports, roads and stadiums. She also took a dig at the Congress over the turmoil in its ranks in Chhattisgarh where it is in power and said the party fails to deliver whenever it gets people's blessings in the form of majority in the assembly. ""Despite winning with such a huge majority (in Chhattisgarh in 2018), their MLAs are visiting Delhi and its surprising that the Chief Minister is giving statements that Congress MLAs have returned and there is no change (in leadership). You (Congress) have got blessings from people to serve them. ""Instead of doing that you (CM) are sitting here and praying to god (to save his chair) ... What happened to the government here?"" she said, referring to recent trips of Congress MLAs to Delhi amid speculation of possible change in leadership. The Congress, after getting a majority in polls, focuses on just staying in power, the BJP leader said. ""Whenever the Congress gets people's blessing in the form of a majority, it cannot handle it. Remember when Rajiv Gandhi ji was in power with a majority (at the Centre in 1984-89). ""Was he able to run it for five years? Getting support and blessings is one thing but serving people by keeping focused and governance is another thing. They (Congress) just remains focused on looting by staying in power and people are watching it,"" she added. Highlighting various welfare schemes of the Modi government, Ms Sitharaman said since 2014, its priority has been to rapidly push development agenda. ""We believe in the guiding principle of ''sabka sath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas and sabka prayas'' ((with all, development for all and with everyone's trust and effort) to take the nation ahead on the path of development. ""This mantra is aimed at benefiting everyone. It is a principle which is based on empowering people by bringing everyone on the path of development,"" she said.   ""We want to empower (citizens) not through ways of offering entitlement. However, it doesn't mean denying relief to those who need it. For this purpose, several other programmes are being run like PM Awas Yojna, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and others,"" she added. Ms Sitharaman also mentioned about funds allocated to the Chhattisgarh government by the Centre under various schemes. "

BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh told a press meet that the flood situation in vast stretches of East and West Midnapore districts, Hooghly and Howrah has worsened over the years due to the inaction of Trinamool Congress in the past 10 years and the Left Front government previous to it. ""What did Mamata Banerjee do other than blaming the Centre for the floods ? Where did the crores of Rupees sent by Centre and international funding agencies to undertake dredging of canals go? There is poor maintenance by the state irrigation department. ""She only undertakes aerial survey, blames DVC and Centre and writes letters to the PM. Her officials write to their central counterparts, to Jharkhand government. What can the Jharkhand government do in this matter? She should address the reasons for the floods in Bengal,"" Mr Ghosh commented. Ms Banerjee has accused DVC of releasing excess water from its barrages after the heavy rains last week without information during the night. The water discharged by DVC had claimed lives and affected lakhs of people, she said and demanded dredging of the barrages and dams of the Jharkhand government. Mr Ghosh in turn accused Ms Banerjee of taking steps like writing to the prime minister and Jharkhand government only to divert attention from her failures to tackle the annual flooding. Mr Ghosh said he was not opposed to TMC rushing its delegations to other parts of country after an incident of political importance, ""But they (TMC) should remember how they prevent opposition leaders like those from BJP when they head to any place which have witnessed brutal attacks by Trinamool Congress goons. We are not allowed to meet the affected families and Section 144 Cr PC is promulgated to prevent us.""

The Russian crew is set to beat a Hollywood project that was announced last year by ""Mission Impossible"" star Tom Cruise together with NASA and Elon Musk's SpaceX. Actress Yulia Peresild, 37, and film director Klim Shipenko, 38, took off from the Russia-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan as scheduled. But they belatedly docked at the ISS at 1222 GMT after veteran cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov switched to manual control. ""Welcome to the ISS!"" Russia's space agency Roscosmos said on Twitter. The crew travelled in a Soyuz MS-19 spaceship for a 12-day mission at the ISS to film scenes for ""The Challenge"". The movie's plot, which has been mostly kept under wraps along with its budget, was revealed by Roscosmos to centre around a female surgeon who is dispatched to the ISS to save a cosmonaut. Shkaplerov and two other Russian cosmonauts aboard the ISS are said to have cameo roles in the film. The ISS crew, which also includes a French, a Japanese and three NASA astronauts, will welcome the newcomers when the hatch opens at around 1410 GMT. - 'It was difficult' - ""It was difficult psychologically, physically and emotionally... but I think when we reach our goal all the challenges won't seem so bad,"" Peresild -- who was selected out of 3,000 applicants for the role -- said at a pre-flight press conference on Monday. True to a pre-flight tradition religiously observed by cosmonauts, the crew said that on Sunday they watched the classic Soviet film ""The White Sun of the Desert"". Shipenko and Peresild are expected to return to Earth on October 17 in a capsule with cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky, who has been on the ISS for the past six months. ""Space is where we became pioneers, where despite everything we maintain a fairly confident position,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday. If successful, the mission will add to a long list of firsts for Russia's space industry. The Soviets launched the first satellite Sputnik, and sent the first animal, a dog named Laika, the first man, Yuri Gagarin, and the first woman, Valentina Tereshkova, into orbit. But compared with the Soviet era, modern Russia has struggled to innovate and its space industry is fighting to secure state funding with the Kremlin prioritising military spending. Its space agency is still reliant on Soviet-designed technology and has faced a number of setbacks, including corruption scandals and botched launches. Russia is also falling behind in the global space race, facing tough competition from the United States and China, with Beijing showing growing ambitions in the industry. - Russians 'lost interest' - Roscosmos was also dealt a blow after SpaceX last year successfully delivered astronauts to the ISS, costing Russia its monopoly for journeys to the orbital station. For political analyst Konstantin Kalachev, the space film is a matter of PR and a way to ""distract"" Russians from the ""problems"" that Roscosmos is facing. ""This is supposed to inspire Russians, show how cool we are, but I think Russians have completely lost interest in the space industry,"" Kalachev told AFP. In a bid to spruce up its image and diversify its revenue, Russia's space programme revealed this year that it will be reviving its tourism programme to ferry fee-paying adventurers to the ISS. After a decade-long pause, Russia will send two Japanese tourists -- including billionaire Yusaku Maezawa -- to the ISS in December, capping a year that has been a milestone for amateur space travel. Last month, SpaceX completed the first all-civilian mission to space that took four untrained astronauts on a three-day loop around the Earth's orbit. The trip followed billionaire Richard Branson's several minutes in weightlessness in July, with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos completing a similar mission days later.   Later this month, 90-year-old actor William Shatner, known for his portrayal of Captain Kirk in the Star Trek series, will fly to space on a mission with Bezos's Blue Origin.

The RLD president, one of the few leaders to reach the Uttar Pradesh district where eight people, including four farmers, were killed during a farmers' protest on Sunday, said he had to employ ""guerrilla tactics"" to reach the district. ""Reaching Lakhimpur was a tough task because Yogi Adityanath has put the entire government machinery to work towards thwarting the Opposition. There needs to be a separation between the state and the party which is not there in UP... from the district magistrate to state-level officials, and the police, it seems everyone has taken membership of the BJP,"" Mr Chaudhary alleged in a phone interview to news agency PTI. Mr Chaudhary, who took 13 hours to reach Lakhimpur Kheri from Delhi, longer than it would otherwise take to cover the 420 km distance, met the families of some of the victims. All roads to Lakhimpur Kheri, about 130 km from Lucknow, have been blocked for opposition leaders with most, including Congress' Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Bhupesh Baghel as well as Akhilesh Yadav, being stopped from entering the district. It is a ""worrisome trend"" that no one in the bureaucracy has raised questions over orders given by the political class, Mr Chaudhary said, adding that he was surprised to hear Additional Director General, Law and Order, Prashant Kumar saying that political people are not allowed in the district. ""What does that mean? Do you not have faith in the political process? Why do they fight elections if they don't have faith in the political voice? It is across the board, you see different parties... senior leaders are still in confinement. It is a shameful incident and reflects the callous attitude of the administration,"" Mr Chaudhary said. Four of the eight killed in Sunday's violence in Lakhimpur Kheri were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to an event in the area. The others were identified as BJP workers and their driver who were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and attacked by the protesters. The Uttar Pradesh Police has lodged a case against Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra's son Ashish but no arrest has been made so far. Giving details of his journey to Lakhimpur Kheri, glimpses of which he put out on Twitter, Mr Chaudhary said it was a ""tough journey"" that meant walking some distance with his face covered in a 'gamchha (towel)' and changing vehicles. He reached last evening. ""I had to change many roads as soon as I got advance information that a particular road had been sealed. We could not communicate with anyone as we had switched off our telephones. I had to send people who were with me on a different route, so a lot of guerilla tactics had to be employed... it is again frightening to have to do those things,"" he said. He backed the demand from some Opposition quarters to impose President's rule in the state. ""The minister who is in charge of the Home department has egged on supporters to take on farmers. His son, after that, had taken his vehicle and deliberately (mowed down farmers), it was an intentional crime, it was premeditated, it was not a spur of the moment incident or an accident,"" Mr Chaudhary alleged. He said the farmers told him that sticks were tied to the front of the vehicle that mowed down farmers for maximum impact, but clarified that he cannot verify the claim. Hitting out at the Yogi government, Jayant Chaudhary said not one person who is part of the government has come out and said anything on the death of the farmers. ""Mr Maurya tweeted about Lakhimpur but is silent about the death of farmers. Yogi-ji gave his usual one statement. Apart from that, you feel almost the entire government machinery is working to suppress the (truth) of the incident,"" he said. ""That way it fulfils all criteria (for the imposition President's rule). The government is trying to suppress the people's voice, it is trying to play down crimes and like an emergency, it is clamping down... it is imposing harsh rules on the Opposition, trying to suppress them,"" Mr Chaudhary said. Referring to the videos of Congress leaders Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Deepender Hooda before their detention by the police, the RLD chief said it was ""shocking"" how they were ""manhandled"". In reference to Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda, he said there are certain privileges that come with being a member of the Parliament. In Mr Chaudhary's view, the attitude and behaviour of the police amounted to ""infringing on the right to parliamentary privilege"". Jayant Chaudhary also demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was in Lucknow for an event on Tuesday, should express regret for the ""failures of his government"". ""The PM should also express regret that even after ten months, farmers are sitting on the road."" Talking about his meeting with the victims' families, the RLD chief said a panchayat was being held when he reached the village in Lakhimpur Kheri.   ""One of the things that the farmers pointed out to me was that they feared they may get targeted. The government has announced certain things and they had doubts about how quickly they will be implemented. They also did not want any cases to be filed against farmers and want strict action against the minister."" he said. ""I met the family of the victim (Lavpreet). He has two sisters. He was a young boy. The family doesn't have much support. They have less than two acres of land. Basically, his father is a construction worker. That is how they are supporting themselves. But it is a very brave family,"" Mr Chaudhary said."

The CBI, the lawyers said, should conduct the investigation under the supervision of the Supreme Court. The Uttar Pradesh government has said it would order an inquiry into the issue by a retired judge. ""Action should also be taken against the guilty officials and the minister and his relatives involved in the incident,"" advocates Shivkumar Tripathi and CS Panda have written to Chief Justice Ramana. The lawyers have also asked that the court directs the Home Ministry to ensure the registration of a First Information Report. ""FIR for the incident should be registered and the accused minister's son should also be punished,"" they wrote. An FIR has already been lodged in the case, naming Ashish Mishra, son of the junior home minister Ajay Mishra, accusing him of murder and negligence. The farmers have alleged that Ashish Mishra was driving the SUV that mowed down a group of protesters who were trying to block the visit of the Union minister on Sunday. Four farmers have died -- another four died in the arson and violence that followed.   The farmers have also alleged that one of them was shot. They have demanded that a second postmortem be conducted, preferably at a hospital in Delhi. The first postmortem has attributed all eight deaths to injuries, shock and brain haemorrhage. The lawyers' letter also said that even media reported that the farmers' protest was peaceful regarding their demands. ""Such action on demonstrations are violation of human rights, also a blow to the democratic process,"" it added."

Minister's Response,"Power Minister RK Singh on Tuesday told NDTV that the coal shortage in the country has not led to a power crisis yet and there is no need for rationing at present, insisting that the production will be able to meet the demand over the next few days. Acknowledging that there have been some issues in transportation which a government committee is looking into, the minister said India's demand for power has seen a substantial jump which is a good thing but this has created a huge demand for coal. ""It is not a power crisis. We are meeting the entire demand of the country and the demand is increasing. Yesterday, the demand was about 15,000 megawatts more than the corresponding day in the previous year... that's good news,"" Mr Singh said. ""The coal supply [is] something which we have to monitor. It's an ongoing process because coal is patched from the mines every day. We are monitoring that on a day-to-day basis. We have a group under Secretary Power which has members from the Ministry of Coal as well as the railways et cetera. So, we are meeting whatever demand is there,"" he said. ""One problem of course was that we had rains in the coal-bearing areas. Even yesterday there were showers in some parts of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh et cetera. Coal extraction also gets affected. But we are handling it and we are okay,"" Mr Singh said. ""We are in a position to meet whatever demand there is. The coal dispatches have also increased. Yesterday the dispatch was 268 rakes. Which is an increase of 16 rakes from the previous day. Now that the rains have abated, now the dispatches will increase more,"" the minister added. India is facing possible energy supply problems in the coming months due to coal shortages and a post-pandemic surge in demand, the power minister had said in reports published on Tuesday. India's coal-fired power stations had on average four days' stock at the end of September, the lowest in years. More than half the plants are on alert for outages and the government is mulling bringing idled power stations back into operation. Coal accounts for nearly 70 per cent of India's electricity generation and around three-quarters of the fossil fuel is mined domestically.   State-run giant Coal India, which produces most of the country's supply, has said it is on a ""war footing"" to ensure adequate deliveries. (With inputs from agencies)"

The result of the vote showed 281 Members of Parliament voting in favour of the no-confidence motion, with none against, as the government and its allies boycotted the poll. The crisis comes as Romania, one of the poorest countries in the European Union, battles a deadly fourth wave of coronavirus and as Romanians risk huge bills over the coming winter due to spiralling energy costs. Former banker Florin Citu, 49, has been prime minister only since December after the previous parliamentary election, but has already been abandoned by his centre-right coalition partner and heavily criticised by the left. The centre-right Save Romania Union (USR) party last month withdrew from his liberal coalition, complaining about Citu's ""dictatorial attitude"". The left-wing opposition Social Democrats (PSD) accuse his government of ""impoverishing Romanians and increasing the country's debts"". The vote came after just two hours of debate among Members of Parliament, at the beginning of which Citu asked his opponents: ""What do you have to gain by plunging the country into chaos?"" However, Citu could yet remain in place -- initially on an interim basis but possibly longer-term. Under the constitution, centre-right President Klaus Iohannis would have to name a new prime minister.   There is speculation, however, that Iohannis may simply re-nominate Citu, daring other parties to provoke fresh elections, which according to current opinion polls, would likely favour only the leftist PSD.

The Nobel committee said it was sending a message with its prize announcement just weeks before the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, as the rate of global warming sets off alarm bells around the world. ""The world leaders that haven't got the message yet, I'm not sure they will get it because we are saying it. But ... what we are saying is that the modelling of climate is solidly based in physics theory,"" said chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, Thor Hans Hansson. Manabe, 90, and Hasselmann, 89, share one half of the 10-million-kronor ($1.1-million, one-million-euro) prize for their research on climate models, while Parisi, 73, won the other half for his work on the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems. ""Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann laid the foundation of our knowledge of the Earth's climate and how humanity influences it,"" the Nobel Committee said. ""Giorgio Parisi is rewarded for his revolutionary contributions to the theory of disordered materials and random processes,"" it added. ""The discoveries being recognised this year demonstrate that our knowledge about the climate rests on a solid scientific foundation, based on a rigorous analysis of observations,"" Hansson said. Manabe is affiliated with Princeton University in the US, while Hasselmann is a professor at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg. Parisi, who also won the prestigious Wolf Prize in February, is a professor at Sapienza University of Rome. - 'We have to act now' - Working in the 1960s, Manabe showed how levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere corresponded to increased Earth surface temperatures. He was influential in developing the physical models of Earth's climate and worked on how exactly the heat energy received by Earth from the Sun radiates back into the atmosphere. Hasselmann was credited for working out how climate models can remain reliable despite sometimes chaotic variation in weather trends. The Committee praised his identification of climate ""fingerprints"" caused by both natural and human activities and how much climate change can be contributed solely to man-made emissions. Parisi was honoured for his work in the 1980s that was said by the Committee to be ""among the most important contributions"" to the theory of complex systems. His work made it possible for physicists to understand apparently entirely random materials, with wide-ranging applications including mathematics, biology, and machine learning. Linking Manabe and Hasselman's work to Parisi's, the Nobel Foundation said this year's prize ""recognises new methods for describing complex systems and predicting their long-term behaviour."" ""One complex system of vital importance to humankind is Earth's climate."" ""It's clear that for future generations, we have to act now in a very fast way,"" Parisi told reporters during a live telephone interview when asked if he had a message for the COP26 summit. - Prize ceremony cancelled - In Geneva, the head of the World Meteorological Organization, Petteri Taalas, said the prize demonstrates that ""climate science is highly valued, and it should be highly valued."" Tuesday's Physics Prize was the first Nobel in Physics or Chemistry to honour climate work since the 1995 Chemistry Prize was awarded for research into Earth's ozone hole. Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai won the 2004 Peace Prize for her work against deforestation in Africa, and former US vice president Al Gore and the UN's IPCC won in 2007 for raising awareness of climate change. In 2018, economist William Nordhaus was honoured ""for integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis"". The Physics Prize was the second Nobel of the season after the medicine prize on Monday went to a US duo for discoveries on receptors for temperature and touch. The award for chemistry will be announced on Wednesday, followed by the much-anticipated prizes for literature on Thursday and peace on Friday before the economics prize winds things up on Monday, October 11. The Nobel Foundation has already announced that the glittering prize ceremony and banquet held in Stockholm in December for the science and literature laureates will not happen this year due to the pandemic. Like last year, laureates will receive their awards in their home countries. A decision has yet to be made about the lavish Peace Prize ceremony held in Oslo on the same day.

Violence erupted in the UP district, about 400 km from Delhi, when farmers were protesting against BJP leaders.
  No arrest has been made even though a murder case was filed. Union Minister Ajay Mishra's son, Ashish, is named as the only accused. Farmers have alleged he was driving a car that ran over eight people. The Minister and his son have maintained they were not at the site. The Congress has been attacking the BJP over Ms Gandhi Vadra's arrest, saying no arrest memorandum has been shared. Priyanka Gandhi said she was ""manhandled, pushed and shoved"" during the confrontation. Today, former Union Minister P Chidambaram, while talking to NDTV, said, ""No woman can be arrested before sunrise."" The Congress has also been questioning why the accused is still free. Earlier, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel began a sit-in protest outside the Lucknow airport as he was stopped by the state police when he was on his way to meet Ms Gandhi Vadra.

Tejinder Virk, hospitalised in Medanta, said it was unfortunate that even after 72 hours, the man had not been arrested. Mr Virk had organised the protest on Sunday against the Union Minister's visit to the area for an event. ""This was a conspiracy to kill us. Ajay Mishra had given a statement that he would not allow farmers in Uttar Pradesh, let alone Lakhimpur. We were protesting against this statement. We were constantly in touch with the police and administration. We were standing along the route to wave black flags at him,"" Mr Virk, being treated for severe wounds, told NDTV. ""We were told at 3 pm that their route has changed. We started going back peacefully. Suddenly, speeding cars hit us from behind. The car was at over 100 km/hour speed. They ran us over on purpose. Ajay Mishra's son and his men were in the car. Then I lost consciousness."" According to Mr Virk, an agitated crowd later attacked the convoy. ""Our people saved some of them and turned them in to the cops"" Mr Virk demanded that the Union Minister be sacked. ""I am willing to testify. The Yogi Adityanath government is helping the attackers,"" he said. Simranjeet Singh, a farmer, says he saw people deserting the cars in the convoy, firing shots, and running away. But he said he couldn't see who was driving the SUV that rammed protesters. It started out as a peaceful protest against the Union Minister's visit, in which black flags would be shown to him. Within 3 minutes, the cars drove into the protesters and people fell. ""I was volunteering and looking after the langar. Then a Thar, Fortuner, and Scorpio (three cars in the convoy) came charging at a speed of 80-100 km/hour. The Thar crushed our farmers from the back,"" said Singh. On the driver of the Thar, Singh said: ""It all happened very fast. On both sides of the Thar, there were men standing. The cars were moving at a high speed, you can tell from videos."" He said he saw five-seven people coming out of the cars and firing constantly. The protesters had already declared they would be marching on that road, he said and had told the minister's people that they should divert their cars.   ""I think they thought that everything has been so peaceful... something has to happen. We were targeted by them and the farmers were run over."" Singh, along with other volunteers, helped take the wounded to the hospital. Among them was 19-year-old Lovepreet Singh, who begged his father from hospital to ""come soon"" but died before he could see his family."

A top police officer of Uttar Pradesh explained the inaction today, saying they were ""busy"". ""We were first busy with negotiations with farmers and then with postmortems and then with getting the cremations done. We follow a due process in every case and we will investigate this case thoroughly,"" SN Sabat, the Additional Director General of Police for the Lucknow Zone, told NDTV. Asked again by NDTV if the attitude would have been similar if the high profile of the accused was not involved, Mr Sabat said, ""The attitude of the police is towards the victim and not the accused"" and refused to take further questions. In the FIR filed, Ashish Mishra has been accused of murder and death by negligence. Farmers who were protesting against the visit of his father of the state's Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya on Sunday, said the minister's son was at the wheels of an SUV that mowed down a group, killing four people and injuring several others. The violence it triggered led to four other deaths. A video of the horrifying moment circulating on social media -- NDTV has not been able to verify its authenticity -- shows an SUV driving into a group of protesters from behind, crushing many of them. Ajay Mishra, the junior minister for home, had acknowledged the accident but said the vehicle overturned, crushing the protesters who were throwing stones at the cavalcade. The farmers have also alleged that one of the four people have died of bullet wounds, demanding that a second postmortem be conducted at a Delhi hospital. The body has not been cremated, even though the funeral for the other three was conducted this afternoon. Ajay Mishra and his son have both denied that they were present at the spot. In an interview to NDTV, Ashish Mishra said. ""I was not in the car. I was at my paternal home in Banwirpur village where a wrestling match was being organised. I was there from the morning till the end of the event"". Opposition leaders have repeatedly questioned the police inaction against him. ""Those who ruthlessly crush the farmers roam free and we are in police custody for 36 hours. The farmer families are mourning and there are celebrations in Lucknow,"" Congress's Deepender Singh Hooda – arrested yesterday with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra yesterday -- tweeted in Hindi, signing it ""From Police Lines Sitapur"".   After her arrest, Ms Gandhi Vadra had told NDTV, ""If you can arrest us, why not the murder-accused minister's son"". Today, tweeting the viral video of the crash, Ms Gandhi Vadra tweeted, ""@narendramodi Sir, your government has kept me in custody for the last 28 hours without any order and FIR.

""Today, we have organised this programme to mark completion of one year of Kappan being in jail. He was arrested even before going to the spot. Till date he is behind bars. We are fighting for free media. There should be no curb on media if someone is going on a spot to report,"" said PCI president Umakant Lakhera. ""Spot and investigative reporting is dying day by day. We are appealing to the highest judiciary of the country to release Kappan and to quash the charges against him,"" he added. Members of the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ), PCI and the Delhi Union of Journalists (DUJ) joined the protest. Siddique Kappan and three others were arrested by the Mathura police in Uttar Pradesh on October 5 last year when they were on their way to a village in Hathras to meet the family members of a Dalit girl who had died after being gang-raped.   The four were arrested on the apprehension of causing a breach of peace, but were later slapped with stringent charges of sedition and being involved in various terror offences.

Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team, says the social media giant keeps its algorithms and operations a secret. ""The core of the issue is that no one can understand Facebook's destructive choices better than Facebook, because only Facebook gets to look under the hood,"" she said in written testimony prepared for the hearing. ""A critical starting point for effective regulation is transparency,"" she said in testimony to be delivered to a Senate Commerce subcommittee. ""On this foundation, we can build sensible rules and standards to address consumer harms, illegal content, data protection, anticompetitive practices, algorithmic systems and more."" Haugen will tell the panel that Facebook executives regularly choose profits over user safety. ""The company's leadership knows ways to make Facebook and Instagram safer and won't make the necessary changes because they have put their immense profits before people,"" she will say. ""It is accountable to no one."" Haugen came forward this week to reveal she was the one who provided documents used in a Wall Street Journal investigation and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teen girls. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. The Journal's stories showed the company contributed to increased polarization online when it made changes to its content algorithm; failed to take steps to reduce vaccine hesitancy; and was aware that Instagram harmed the mental health of teenage girls. Haugen said Facebook had also done too little to prevent its platform from being used by people planning violence.   Facebook was used by people planning mass killings in Myanmar and the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, determined to toss out the 2020 election results.

Mr Baghel said he wanted to meet Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who has been in police custody since yesterday in Sitapur. She said she was ""illegally"" arrested when she was on her way to Lakhimpur to meet those affected by Sunday's violence while daring the UP government to keep her in custody ""indefinitely"". ""I came to Lucknow to meet Priyanka Gandhi ji at Sitapur. But I am not being allowed to leave the airport,"" the Chhattisgarh Chief Minister said. In a tweet, the 60-year-old leader wrote in Hindi: ""Without any order, I am being stopped outside the Lucknow airport."" The photo he shared shows him in a white kurta-pyjama, sitting on the floor, surrounded by cops and his guards who are looking at him. The Congress leader also shared a nearly one-minute long video where he can be seen questioning the officials. ""Dhara 144 to Lakhimpur me hai. Hum Lakhimpur to jaa nahi rahe hain. Problem kya hai? (Prohibitory orders are in Lakhimpur, but we are not going there. So what's the problem),"" he asks a cop. In Lakhimpur, a protest by farmers against the BJP turned violent on Sunday when eight people - including four farmers - were killed as a car ran over them. A murder case was filed amid outrage and Union Minister Ajay Mishra's son, Ashish, is the only accused named. Farmers alleged he was driving the car.  Many opposition leaders have been stopped from going to the UP district since Sunday. ""Padiye...padiye (please read),"" Mr Baghel is seen saying in the clip, telling another cop who starts reading an order amid the conversation. ""Humko kyun roka ja raha hai? Main aapke Lakhimpur nahi ja raha hun (Why are we being stopped. I am not going to your Lakhimpur),"" he again says. To this, the officials reply that large gatherings are also banned in Lucknow. This was the second consecutive day that the Congress leader hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government over his UP visit. On Monday, he said, he was not allowed to land in Lucknow. Just last week, the Congress gave a key election role to Mr Baghel in UP - that of a senior observer.   The BJP is facing criticism over the Lakhimpur deaths ahead of the state elections due next year. Haryana, Punjab and Delhi also saw demonstrations on Monday.  In the state capital, former UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was yesterday detained outside his home when he was protesting the Lakhimpur deaths."

Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the incident on Sunday. The video, being shared widely on social media, is yet to be verified by the police. NDTV cannot independently verify its authenticity. It is also not clear from the visuals who is in the driving seat. Earlier today, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted the viral clip with a pointed question for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""@narendramodi Sir, your government has kept me in custody for the last 28 hours without any order and FIR. This person who crushed the annadata (farmers) has not been arrested yet.

Another vehicle, with sirens blaring, is seen tailing the SUV that hit the farmers. The video matches descriptions given to NDTV on Sunday by farmers at the spot, who said the car suddenly hit them from behind. The make and colour of the lead SUV that hits the farmers also matches other visuals from the site. The farmers have alleged that the protesters were run over by an SUV driven by Union Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra's son Ashish Mishra. Both the Minister and his son have denied even being at the spot. The incident took place when a group of protesting farmers in Tikonia area of Kheri tried to block Mr Mishra and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya from visiting. The protesters were upset over a recent speech by Mr Mishra. The farmers claimed the violence broke out after a car in the minister's convoy ran over protesters. Visuals from the area showed arson and vehicles set on fire. A murder case has been filed against the Union minister's son.   Minister Ajay Mishra says he is not aware about any FIR against his son. He has also denied that his son was linked to the violence. ""My son wasn't present at the spot. There were miscreants who attacked workers with sticks and swords.

""My son was present at the venue of the (Deputy Chief Minister's) event... all through, I was accompanying the deputy chief minister,"" he said.

In the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation, the BJP established its lead since the beginning of counting at 9 am, and eventually trumped its rivals Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by a huge margin. The poll results ""reaffirm the deep-rooted bond between the people of Gujarat and BJP"", tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation election was being seen as a litmus test for the BJP in the backdrop of its sudden and surprising decision to change the state's chief minister and the entire cabinet recently, ahead of the state Assembly polls due next year. The party had registered a thumping win in the local bodies polls held in February this year. As per the final tally released by the State Election Commission (SEC), out of total 44 seats in the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation, the BJP won 41 seats, the Congress-two and the Aam Aadmi Party got one seat. Counting of votes was also held for three other municipalities - Okha and Bhanvad in Devbhumi-Dwarka district, and Thara municipality of Banaskantha district. As per the final figures released by the SEC after counting of votes, the BJP won 20 out of 24 seats in Thara, while the Congress got only four seats. The BJP retained Okha municipality by winning 34 out of 36 seats, while two seats went to the Congress. However, in a setback to the BJP, the Congress emerged victorious in Bhanvad by winning 16 out of 24 seats. The BJP, which managed to win only eight seats this time, was in power in Bhanvad since 1995. Voting for elections to the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation and the three other municipalities took place on Sunday. Besides, bypolls to elect representatives on 104 vacant seats of various other local bodies were also held the same day. Of the total 2.8 lakh registered voters in Gandhinagar, 56.24 per cent had exercised their franchise. The voter turnout in Okha and Bhanvad was 55.07 and 62.27 per cent, respectively, while Thara had recorded an impressive 73.55 per cent turnout. In Gandhinagar, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had put in a concerted effort apart from traditional rivals BJP and Congress. A total of 161 candidates contested the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation election, with the BJP and Congress fighting in all 44 seats and the AAP in 40 seats. In the 2016 Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation elections, both the Congress and BJP won 16 seats each out of the total 32 seats existing at that time.   Both the parties then had equal chances of forming the board through a draw of lots. However, at the last moment, Congress corporator Pravin Patel switched sides and helped the BJP come to power in the civic body. The latest election was originally supposed to be held in April this year, but it was postponed in view of the high number of COVID-19 cases emerging every day at that time.

Flight attendants might have to rush to open an exit door over a wing if a plane makes an emergency landing on water. To do so, they would have to clamber over people - ""Imagine how I could do that in a pencil skirt,"" Ms Solomennaya said. But SkyUp has made a welcome change. According to a press release, the airline's passengers will soon be greeted by flight attendants wearing the new SkyUp Champions uniform. The uniform includes the Nike Air Max 720 sneakers instead of high heels - shoes that feature ""incredible cushioning and resilience for maximum comfort all day long."" The airline said it is also ditching suits and skirts for ""trouser suits with soft tailoring aesthetics and trench coats."" To come up with these new uniforms, it studied the evolution of cabin crew uniforms from the early 1930s.  ""Times have changed, women have changed, so in contrast to the conservative classics, heels, red lipstick and a bun, a new, more modern and comfortable image of a 'champion' has appeared,"" said Marianna Grigorash, Head of SkyUp Airlines Marketing Department, while explaining the concept behind the new orange-coloured uniforms.    ""The study and interviews with flight attendants became the starting point for working on a new image...So we decided to replace the shoes with sneakers."" Ms Grigorash told BBC that the company realised its female staff did not want to be seen as ""sexualised and playful"".

The court however sought to know the exact time when the system would be in place in the trial courts as the purpose of this exercise is to ensure that no inconvenience is caused to advocates and litigants in case there is a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh directed the Delhi government to place on record its status report regarding sanctioning ₹ 79.48 crore for setting up infrastructure for hybrid system in the subordinate courts here. The court also said the status report shall contain details of the amount as well as a chart showing items which have been approved and not approved by the government. It said the report be filed within three days and listed the matter for further hearing on October 18. During the hearing, the bench observed, ""The bird view is that if at all the third wave of the pandemic comes, people shall not be required to go to courts and the hybrid system shall be put in place."" ""The question is when it will be put in place. Give us a date from when the hybrid system will be in place in the district courts. The problem is that it is taking so long and the whole purpose would be defeated."" The court also directed the Centre, represented through standing counsel Anil Soni, to file an affidavit disclosing the steps taken by it to facilitate hybrid hearings in tribunals and forums which come under its responsibility. The high court was hearing two pleas by lawyers Anil Kumar Hajelay and Manashwy Jha seeking various prayers including to conduct hybrid hearings in district courts on physical hearing days in view of the COVID-19 threat. The high court had earlier asked the Delhi government to file an affidavit on the steps taken by it to provide infrastructure to subordinate courts for hybrid hearings. The court had earlier made it clear to the Delhi government that if the proposal to set up infrastructure for hybrid hearings in trial courts and quasi-judicial bodies is turned down on grounds of expenditure, it will examine expenses incurred by it on subsidies and public advertisements from April 2020. It had also directed the Delhi government to take expeditious steps to provide proper infrastructure for the purpose and said it was mindful that the authorities incur huge money on subsidies and advertisements. The high court had earlier expressed ""complete dissatisfaction"" over the Delhi government's conduct of not providing proper infrastructure to facilitate hybrid hearings in trial courts and quasi-judicial bodies here and had said little sensitivity needed to be shown by the authorities.   It had said the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic was expected and for the last four months, nothing has happened in terms of providing infrastructure for facilitating virtual hearings in district courts.

Nevertheless, many organisers seemed overjoyed at the DDMA permit, allowing to have physical celebrations after the festivities were organised virtually last year. The Lav Kush Ramlila Committee that organises Ramlila at Red Fort every year, will have the COVID-19 protocols in place for the next 10 days, from October 6 to 16. “We will follow all the DDMA guidelines during the celebrations. Social distancing will be maintained with chairs placed five feet away from each other. Banners of ‘no mask, no entry' will be put up at the venue, and sanitisation will be mandatory,” said Arjun Kumar, Secretary of the committee that organised the Ram Lila virtually last year. He added that the “maidan” will be cleaned every day with help from the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to ensure cleanliness and hygiene. Ramlila is a theatrical reenactment of Hindu God Rama's life, capturing his journey along with his wife Sita and brother Lakshman, as he is exiled from his own kingdom, his fight and eventual victory over demon king Ravana that is retold every year around this time to celebrate the triumph of good over evil, culminating on Dussehra. The Shri Dharmik Leela Committee that too stages the Ram Lila performances at the Red Fort every year since 1924, has shrunk its 10-day programme to a single day celebration at the ISKCON temple in the East of Kailash. “The Lal Quila Maidan made sense when we had a footfall of over five lakh people over 10 days…when it was like a ‘mela' with not just the performances, but also food stalls, swings and rides for the children. “This year, we will pack the performance that used to happen over 10 days, into a single day's worth of celebrations,” said Ravi Jain, Press Secretary of the committee. With the DDMA's nod for physical Ramlila celebrations coming on September 30, less than a week before the festival begins on October 6, the Shri Ram Lila Committee, that hosts the festivities at the Ramlila Maidan in Ajmeri Gate, has decided to skip the event this year.   “They can give us permission two days before and expect us to organise an event like this. You need time, money, and the requisite infrastructure to enable the organisers to put together such a grand event. “We start our preparations at least one month in advance, but this year the conditions are such that we are doing nothing,” said Rajesh Khanna, Secretary General of the committee."

Pyongyang is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, which have seen rapid progress under current leader Kim Jong Un. The report's publication comes after Pyongyang sparked international concern with a series of missile tests in the span of a few weeks, prompting the UN Security Council to hold an emergency meeting. The report -- which was published online Tuesday Seoul time, and covers the period from February 6 to August 3 -- said the North continued to polish its weapons programmes. ""Despite the country's focus on its worsening economic travails, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continued to maintain and develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs,"" said the report, compiled by a panel of experts monitoring sanctions on the isolated country. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of the North, which like the South last month saw the 30th anniversary of their simultaneous admission to the United Nations. Pyongyang has not carried out an intercontinental ballistic missile launch or nuclear test since 2017 but the report said tests ""combining ballistic and guidance technologies"" were conducted while activity continued at key sites related to the nuclear programme. In early 2020 the country closed its borders to try to protect itself against the coronavirus pandemic, which first emerged in neighbouring China, but has nonetheless ""continued its illicit efforts to procure specific components from overseas and to seek opportunities to transfer its own products to its partners"", the report added. It said the North's coronavirus blockade had continued ""fundamentally to impact the movement of people and goods, both licit and illicit, within, into and out of the country"". The import of consumer products, including luxury goods banned under UN sanctions, had ""virtually stopped"", the report said, but said it was investigating illicit transfers of luxury vehicles. Leader Kim has been seen using Lexus SUVs in recent months and the report highlighted an attempted shipment of more than $1 million-worth of luxury vehicles, including such models, allegedly from the United Arab Emirates to Ningbo, China, for onward delivery to the North. Pyongyang has stayed away from nuclear talks since the collapse of a second summit between Kim and then US president Donald Trump in Hanoi and has rebuffed South Korean efforts to revive dialogue. Under President Joe Biden, the United States has repeatedly declared its willingness to meet North Korean representatives, while saying it will seek denuclearisation.   Last week, Kim decried Washington's repeated offers of talks without preconditions as a ""petty trick"", accusing the Biden administration of continuing the ""hostile policy"" of its predecessors.

The Chief of Air Staff said India is fully ready to deal with a ""two-front"" war scenario involving China and Pakistan and that the focus has been to enhance the IAF's overall combat capabilities.

The theatre commands are being planned to integrate capabilities of the three services and to ensure optimal utilisation of their resources. He said the IAF's strike capability has become more potent with induction of Rafale jets and various weapons. On the alleged rape case in Coimbatore, he said no two finger test was conducted and that disciplinary action will be taken against those found guilty in the probe into the case. An Indian Air Force official in Coimbatore has been charged with sexual assault of a woman colleague on September 10.   The 28-year-old woman Air Force officer has levelled serious charges against IAF authorities, including subjecting her to a banned finger test and also forcing her to withdraw the complaint against the accused Flight Lieutenant.

Ending his 52-year-long association with the party, Mr Balachandran, a member of the KPCC executive committee, said both majority and minority communities are moving away from the Congress and the people would not stand with a party which has lost its direction. He also slammed the style of functioning of the Congress state leadership, alleging that they were not able to take a clear political stand on the issues affecting the people. Announcing the decision at a press conference, Mr Balachandran said his decision to quit the party was based on the realization that it will not be able to function anymore in accordance with the spirit of the Congress workers. Mr Balachandran's is the latest in the series of resignations happening in the Congress in Wayanad.   Former MLA K C Rosakutty, KPCC secretary M S Vishwanathan, and DCC general secretary Anil Kumar had quit the party before the Assembly polls held in the state in April this year.

The revelations in France are the latest to rock the Roman Catholic Church, after a series of sexual abuse scandals around the world, often involving children. The church had shown ""deep, total and even cruel indifference for years,"" protecting itself rather than the victims of what was systemic abuse, said Jean-Marc Sauve, head of the commission that compiled the report. Most of the victims were boys, he said, many of them aged between 10 and 13. The church not only did not take the necessary measures to prevent abuse but also failed to report it and sometimes knowingly putting children in touch with predators, he said. Speaking just after Sauve at the public presentation of the report, the archbishop of Reims and head of the French conference of bishops, Eric de Moulins-Beaufort, spoke of shame, asked for forgiveness and promised to act. The commission was established by Catholic bishops in France at the end of 2018 to shed light on abuses and restore public confidence in the church at a time of dwindling congregations. It has worked independently from the Church. Sauve said the problem was still there. He added that the church had until the 2000s shown complete indifference to victims and that it only started to really change its attitude in 2015-2016. CHURCH URGED TO REFORM The Catholic Church's teaching on subjects such as sexuality, obedience and the sanctity of the priesthood helped create blind spots which allowed sexual abuse by clergy to happen, Sauve said, adding that the church needed to reform the way it approached those issues to rebuild trust with society. Sauve said the commission itself had identified around 2,700 victims through a call for testimony, and thousands more had been found in archives. But a wide-ranging study by research and polling groups estimated that there had been around 216,000 victims, and the number could rise to 330,000 when including abuse by lay members. There have been around 2,900-3,200 suspected paedophiles in the French church over the last 70 years, he added. The French findings come a year after Britain said the Catholic Church had received more than 900 complaints involving over 3,000 instances of child sex abuse in England and Wales between 1970 and 2015, and that there had been more than 100 reported allegations a year since 2016. Before Sauve took the floor, Francois Devaux, who set up victims' association La Parole Liberee, told church representatives at the public presentation of the report: ""You are a disgrace to our humanity,"" , before Sauve took the floor. ""In this hell there have been abominable mass crimes ... but there has been even worse, betrayal of trust, betrayal of morale, betrayal of children,"" said Devaux, who also accused the church of cowardice.   He thanked the commission, saying that he hoped the report would prove a turning point: ""You finally bring victims an institutional recognition of the responsibility of the church.""

The researchers noted that considerations for booster shots should take global COVID-19 vaccine supply into account as people in many countries around the world have not yet received a primary vaccination series. The research team analysed 3,436,957 electronic health records from the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) health system between December 4, 2020, and August 8, 2021, to assess vaccine effectiveness againstS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisation. During the study period, 5.4 per cent of people were infected withS-CoV-2. Among those who were infected, 6.6 per cent were hospitalised. The average time since being fully vaccinated was between three to four months. The study found that vaccine effectiveness against Delta variant infections at one month after two doses of Pfizer was 93 per cent and fell to 53 per cent after four months. Effectiveness against other variants at one month after receiving two doses was 97 per cent and declined to 67 per cent after four months, the researchers said. Effectiveness against Delta-related hospitalisations remained high (93 per cent) for the duration of the study period, they said. Researchers did not observe a difference in waning between-CoV-2 variant types. However, they noted that because Delta became the dominant strain in the middle of the study period, analyses with longer follow-up to measure the rate of waning for the variant compared to other strains are needed. ""Our variant-specific analysis clearly shows that the BNT162b2 vaccine is effective against all current variants of concern, including Delta,"" said Luis Jodar, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Pfizer Vaccines. ""COVID-19 infections in people who have received two vaccine doses are most likely due to waning and not caused by delta or other variants escaping vaccine protection,"" said Luis Jodar. The authors acknowledge some limitations in their study. The researchers could not determine causal relationships between vaccination and COVID-19 outcomes as vaccination status among the study population was not randomised.   They also did not have data on adherence to mask guidelines, social interactions, occupation, and disease rates in the study population, which could impact the likelihood of contracting and being tested forS-CoV-2 infection.

Taiwan lives under the constant threat of invasion by China, which views the self-ruled democratic island as its territory to be re-taken one day, by force if necessary. President Xi Jinping has described the seizure of Taiwan as ""inevitable"" and Beijing has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure since Tsai's 2016 election, as she views the island as ""already independent"" and not part of a ""one China"". Nearly 150 Chinese warplanes had breached Taiwan's ADIZ since Friday when Beijing marked its National Day with its then-biggest aerial show of force, buzzing the island with 38 planes. Tsai warned a failure to defend Taiwan would be ""catastrophic"" for both the island and the wider region in an article she wrote for Foreign Affairs published on Tuesday. ""They should remember that if Taiwan were to fall, the consequences would be catastrophic for regional peace and the democratic alliance system,"" Tsai said. ""It would signal that in today's global contest of values, authoritarianism has the upper hand over democracy."" Taiwan hopes for peaceful coexistence with China, she said, but ""if its democracy and way of life are threatened, Taiwan will do whatever it takes to defend itself."" Tsai's government on Monday urged Beijing to stop ""irresponsible provocative actions"" after a record 56 Chinese jets including nuclear-capable bombers crossed into Taiwan's air defence identification zone. ""Amid almost daily intrusions by the People's Liberation Army, our position on cross-strait relations remains constant: Taiwan will not bend to pressure,"" Tsai added. The ADIZ is not the same as Taiwan's territorial airspace but includes a far greater area that overlaps with part of China's own air defence identification zone and even includes some of the mainland. In the last two years, Beijing has begun sending large sorties into Taiwan's defence zone to signal dissatisfaction at key moments -- and to keep Taipei's ageing fighter fleet regularly stressed.   Last year, a record 380 Chinese military jets made incursions into Taiwan's defence zone. The number as of October this year has already exceeded 600.

Mr Baghel said he wanted to meet Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who has been in police custody since yesterday in Sitapur. She said she was ""illegally"" arrested when she was on her way to Lakhimpur to meet those affected by Sunday's violence while daring the UP government to keep her in custody ""indefinitely"". ""I came to Lucknow to meet Priyanka Gandhi ji at Sitapur. But I am not being allowed to leave the airport,"" the Chhattisgarh Chief Minister said. In a tweet, the 60-year-old leader wrote in Hindi: ""Without any order, I am being stopped outside the Lucknow airport."" The photo he shared shows him in a white kurta-pyjama, sitting on the floor, surrounded by cops and his guards who are looking at him. The Congress leader also shared a nearly one-minute long video where he can be seen questioning the officials. ""Dhara 144 to Lakhimpur me hai. Hum Lakhimpur to jaa nahi rahe hain. Problem kya hai? (Prohibitory orders are in Lakhimpur, but we are not going there. So what's the problem),"" he asks a cop. In Lakhimpur, a protest by farmers against the BJP turned violent on Sunday when eight people - including four farmers - were killed as a car ran over them. A murder case was filed amid outrage and Union Minister Ajay Mishra's son, Ashish, is the only accused named. Farmers alleged he was driving the car.  Many opposition leaders have been stopped from going to the UP district since Sunday. ""Padiye...padiye (please read),"" Mr Baghel is seen saying in the clip, telling another cop who starts reading an order amid the conversation. ""Humko kyun roka ja raha hai? Main aapke Lakhimpur nahi ja raha hun (Why are we being stopped. I am not going to your Lakhimpur),"" he again says. To this, the officials reply that large gatherings are also banned in Lucknow. This was the second consecutive day that the Congress leader hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government over his UP visit. On Monday, he said, he was not allowed to land in Lucknow. Just last week, the Congress gave a key election role to Mr Baghel in UP - that of a senior observer.   The BJP is facing criticism over the Lakhimpur deaths ahead of the state elections due next year. Haryana, Punjab and Delhi also saw demonstrations on Monday.  In the state capital, former UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was yesterday detained outside his home when he was protesting the Lakhimpur deaths."

""No action has been taken against the culprits of the incident (Lakhimpur Kheri) yet. It's very unfortunate that leaders are celebrating 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav' in the same state (Uttar Pradesh) where justice has been denied,"" Bhupesh Baghel said. The Chief Minister alleged his party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who went to the district in the wake of the incident, has been detained, and on the other side the Union Minister's son, who allegedly mowed down farmers, is roaming freely. ""The Union minister's son ran over farmers while the administration arrested Priyanka Gandhi without any warrant. It has been more than 28 hours now. What kind of law is this? A person who went to express solidarity with the victims is getting arrested and the culprits are scot-free,"" he added. Regarding BJP's allegation that the Opposition is indulging in ""political tourism"", Mr Baghel said, ""The statement is 'shameful' and these words are only used by BJP people where eight people have died and when someone goes to sympathise with them, then it is called tourism."" Meanwhile, Mr Baghel informed that he has left for Lucknow. ""I have left for Lucknow. There will be justice with the farmers,"" he tweeted. However, when he landed in Lucknow, he was stopped from exiting the airport. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi today claimed that she has been detained for the last 28 hours without any order or FIR. Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of several farmer unions, alleged that Ashish Mishra Teni, son of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra Teni arrived with three vehicles around the time that farmers were dispersing from their protest at the helipad and mowed down farmers and towards the end also attacked SKM leader Tajinder Singh Virk directly, by trying to run a vehicle over him. Refuting SKM's allegations, minister Teni said that his son was not present at the spot, adding that some miscreants merged with protesting farmers and pelted the stones on the car which lead to the 'unfortunate incident'.   Earlier, Additional Director General (Law and Order) of Uttar Pradesh Police Prashant Kumar said: ""Government will give ₹ 45 lakhs and a government job to the families of four farmers who died in Lakhimpur Kheri yesterday. The injured will be given ₹ 10 lakhs. FIR will be registered based on farmers' complaints. Retired High Court judge will probe the matter."" The ADG also informed that no leader of any political party will be allowed to visit the district as section 144 of CrPC is in place."

In the Gandhinagar civic body, the ruling BJP has so far won 16 out of total 44 seats of 11 wards, election officials said, adding that the Congress registered victory in one seat while AAP is yet to open its account. During the first two hours of counting which began at 9 am, the BJP won 16 seats in the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation, 28 out of 36 in Okha, three out of 24 in Bhanvad and 20 out of 24 seats in Thara municipality, they said. Okha and Bhanvad are located in Devbhumi-Dwarka district, and Thara is in Banaskantha district. Voting for elections to the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation and the three other municipalities took place on Sunday. Besides, bypolls to elect representatives on 104 vacant seats of various other local bodies were also held the same day. Of the total 2.8 lakh registered voters in Gandhinagar, 56.24 per cent had exercised their franchise. The voter turnout in Okha and Bhanvad was 55.07 and 62.27 per cent, respectively, while Thara had recorded an impressive 73.55 per cent turnout. In Gandhinagar, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had put in a concerted effort apart from traditional rivals BJP and Congress. A total of 161 candidates contested the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation poll, with the BJP and Congress fighting in all 44 seats and the AAP in 40 seats. In the 2016 Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation elections, both the Congress and BJP won 16 seats each out of the total 32 seats existing at that time. Both the parties then had equal chances of forming the board through a draw of lots. However, at the last moment, Congress corporator Pravin Patel switched sides and helped the BJP come to power in the civic body. The latest election was originally supposed to be held in April this year, but it was postponed in view of the high number of COVID-19 cases emerging every day at that time. The Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation poll is being seen as a litmus test for the BJP in the backdrop of its sudden and surprising decision to change the state's chief minister and the entire cabinet recently. The party had registered a thumping win in the local bodies polls held in February this year.   The state Assembly polls are due next year.

His comments come as China and European countries face energy crises that are disrupting global supply chains and sending prices soaring. ""Normally the demand starts coming down in the second half of October... when (the weather) starts cooling,"" R. K. Singh told the Indian Express in an interview. ""But it's going to be touch and go,"" Singh said, calling demand for electricity ""tremendous"". ""Demand is not going to go away, it's going to increase... We've added 28.2 million consumers. Most of them are lower-middle class and poor, so they are buying fans, lights, televisions sets,"" he said. India's coal-fired power stations had on average four days' stock at the end of September, the lowest in years. More than half the plants are on alert for outages and the government is mulling bringing idled power stations back into operation. Coal accounts for nearly 70 percent of India's electricity generation and around three-quarters of the fossil fuel is mined domestically. State-run giant Coal India, which produces most of the country's supply, has said it is on a ""war footing"" to ensure adequate deliveries. On top of a rise in demand as Asia's third-largest economy rebounds following a coronavirus wave, India has been hit by recent monsoon rains that flooded mines and disrupted transport. This pushed up prices sharply for coal buyers, including power stations. Buying coal abroad is expensive because international prices have also soared. ""Until supplies stabilise completely, we are likely to see power outages in some pockets, while customers elsewhere may be asked to pay more for power,"" Pranav Master, director for infrastructure advisory at credit ratings firm Crisil, told Bloomberg News. ""Because of imported coal prices shooting through the roof, plants running on domestic coal have had to do a lot of heavy lifting. Things are expected to get better as the rains abate."" European countries are also facing a power crisis, with natural gas reserves at low levels and energy prices surging. China has been hit by widespread power cuts that have closed or partially closed factories, hitting production and global supply chains.   Singh insisted that the Indian government was working hard to avert a crisis, saying that so far ""there is nowhere that we have not been able to supply the quantity of power demanded"".

More than half the nation's plants are on alert for outages after surging electricity demand and a slump in local coal output eroded stockpiles. Power stations had an average of four days' worth of coal at the end of last month, the lowest level in years, and down from 13 days at the start of August. ""I don't know whether I will be comfortable in the next five to six, four to five months,"" Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh was quoted as telling The Indian Express in an interview published Tuesday. While demand does typically slow with cooler weather from mid-October, ""it's going to be touch and go,"" he said. In at least a portion of India's coal fleet the situation has deteriorated in the past week, according to Mr Singh. Coal plants accounting for between 40 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts of capacity currently have less than three days' of fuel stocks, he told the newspaper. That compares to a total national coal capacity of about 203 gigawatts. Coal accounts for about 70% of India's electricity generation, and consumption is forecast to rise in the next few years, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushes for a massive increase in renewables. Like neighboring China, India is suffering from the impacts of a sharp surge in electricity demand, a squeeze on domestic mine output and surging prices of seaborne coal.   Government ministries are working with state-run Coal India Ltd. and NTPC Ltd., India's largest power generator, to raise output from mines and to ensure demand is met, Singh was quoted as saying.

They are protesting against the three farm laws passed by the parliament of India in a highly questionable way and are demanding their withdrawal. The farmers appear to be in no mood to give up. The government of India is equally determined not to concede their demand. Various rounds of talks between the farmers and the government have failed to produce results and therefore stand abandoned at present. This is the overall picture. Now, the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri has drawn renewed attention of the people of the country to this festering sore. The farmers' movement has not moved the BJP. In fact, elements within the BJP seem to have hardened their position on the issue. A video clip reveals how the Haryana Chief Minister exhorted the BJP cadres to organise themselves in every village to challenge the farmers and ""meet force with force"". This is not an isolated incident because it represents the attitude of the entire party and the government of India to crush the agitation by force, if necessary. Talks are out. Dialogue is a sign of weakness for the BJP and its governments at the centre and in the states. So, Lakhimpur Kheri was just waiting to happen. Facts in public domain would show that the local MP, who is also a junior minister in the government of India, was imbued with the same spirit of defiance against the farmers as the rest of the party and its governments in UP and at the centre. In a video clip, he is seen openly saying that the agitating farmers do not know him (read do not understand his 'strength'). All this to much applause from an appreciative audience which had gathered to listen to him. And then this tragic incident takes place in which eight people lose their lives, among whom four were farmers. The allegation is that the farmers were crushed under the wheels of the vehicles which were burnt by the angry farmers subsequently and that the minister's son was directly involved in the incident. The minister's son has denied the charge that he was personally involved. He has claimed that he was not present at the scene of the incident. He has clarified that the vehicles involved in the incident were on their way to receive the Deputy Chief Minister of UP who had been invited for a function in his village organised by him. Now, an agreement appears to have been reached between the farmers and the UP administration under which a judicial enquiry would be conducted by a retired High Court judge and the farmers, dead or injured, would be adequately compensated. The minister's son faces murder charges. The judicial enquiry will take its own time; in the meanwhile, there will be so many other issues to attract media attention from tomorrow, which, with a little help from the government and the 'godi' media ,will enable the people to forget this tragic happening. Those who have gone are gone; those who are injured will recover; soon, it will be business as usual. In any case, all political leaders who wanted to visit Lakhimpur Kheri have been prevented from going there. How long can they persevere? The Lakhimpur Kheri killings however raise many pertinent questions. We all know how the government of UP has been functioning under Yogi. There is a saying in Hindi according to which if a creeper of bitter gourd climbs a Neem tree, you can easily imagine how much more bitter it would become. The government of India has introduced us to a new 'doctrine of state' under which all dissent has to be crushed, if necessary by force. The UP government has further amended it to mean that all dissent has to be necessarily crushed by force. As long as this doctrine applied to the others, specially Jammu and Kashmir, we remained unconcerned. Today, it has come nearer home and applies to us. The BJP is securely ensconced in power and behaves pretty much as it likes. There is no issue, no suffering, no pain, which the people are not willing to undergo, drunk as they are with the heady wine of rabid communalism. As long as the BJP and its governments are seen charging at the windmills of an unseen and imagined enemy, the people will forgive everything and forget all their pain. Marx had described religion as the opiate of the masses. The BJP under its present leadership has proved that it is much more intoxicating than opiate, because opium makes you lazy and leaves you inert, this potion energises you and encourages you to indulge in violence. Over the last seven years, India has been introduced to many new enemies of the nation. It was the political parties in opposition who were the main enemies to begin with. The Congress party with Nehru as its symbol is still the favourite target of the BJP. The minority communities in this country, mainly the Muslim minority, were also identified as enemies. Then came the JNU students, the ""Tukde Tukde Gang"", the ""Lutyens Elite"", the ""Khan Market Gang"", etc. Today, the farmers of the country have been added to the list. The definition is simple: if you oppose those in power today, you are an enemy of the nation. Period. Is the government concerned? Perhaps not. Elections are still sometime away. The BJP knows how to manipulate voter sentiment. Yesterday, it was Pulwama and the surgical strike against Pakistan. And though one cannot, even with a 56""-chest, scale higher peaks each time, we can trust the gullibility of the people in being swayed by considerations other than even the pain they experience at the rising petroleum product prices, the mismanagement of Covid, the deaths due to oxygen shortages, the floating corpses in the Ganga, the loss of territory to China and most importantly, the creeping democratic deficit in the country. Lakhimpur Kheri is already yesterday. Brace for much more violence in the run-up to the UP election.   Yashwant Sinha, former BJP leader, was Minister of Finance (1998-2002) and Minister of External Affairs (2002-2004). He is currently vice-president, Trinamool Congress.

On September 24, two men, Rahul Tyagi and Jagdeep Jagga, allegedly posed as lawyers to enter the Rohini courtroom and fired multiple bullets at jailed gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi, killing him. The police personnel retaliated, allegedly killing the two on the spot. The Delhi Police today informed the court that the security gadgets, installed at court premises, are outdated and the same should be updated or replaced with high-resolution CCTV and monitors, 360-degree vehicle scanning with RF Tag /Bar Code Reader facilities, scanners for luggage and bag checking, scanners for explosive and NDPS checking, and boom barriers. The district courts might be directed to provide these security gadgets and logistics at the earliest to the security unit at each court, Delhi Police suggested to the court. ""CCTV cameras with adequate storage capacity shall be installed at the vulnerable points in each District Court with proper monitoring. Such high-resolution cameras as near the lock-up should be revamped by installing more CCTV cameras in such a manner that it covers all the area, inside and outside the lock-up rooms,"" the Delhi Police said through Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma and Centre Government standing Counsel Ajay Digpaul ""Concertina wires and CCTV cameras should be installed on the boundary wall of the courts to prevent unauthorised entry into the court premises,"" it added. An automatic entry system for advocates, court staff with proper accreditation by way of issuing non-clonable smart identity cards should be considered. Entry gates for visitors, lawyers and court staff, including the police, should be segregated to ensure proper access control, the Delhi Police said. The bench of Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh posted the matter for next Tuesday and ask other stakeholders including the Bar Association to file their replies and suggestions. Meanwhile, the court asked the Delhi Police to share its suggestions with other respondents to avoid duplicity. The Delhi High Court had earlier stressed on proper security and safety system in the national capital and asked the centre, the Delhi Police, the Delhi government and others to give suggestions relating to ensuring safety and security in the courts in wake of the Rohini court firing incident. The court had said that there is a need for a full-proof safety system at the entry gate and therefore installation of hi-tech metal detectors and baggage scanners are required. The court also stressed on the need for under-vehicle surveillance systems and proper training to police personnel deputed at the courts' complexes.   The Delhi High Court had taken suo motu cognizance on issues relating to safety and security in courts after the Rohini court firing. Further probe in this matter is underway.

The accused 29-year-old Flight Lieutenant will be tried under the Court Martial Act, a court in Tamil Nadu's Coimbatore ruled on Thursday as the case was handed over to the India Air Force (IAF). In a statement, the National Commission for Women on Thursday said it has raised the issue with the IAF, stressing that it is '' .. utterly disappointed and strongly condemns the action of Indian Air Force doctors conducting the banned two-finger test on the victim, thereby violating the Supreme Court's decision and also violating the right to privacy and dignity of the victim.'' The woman, who had travelled to the Air Force College for training, said the assault took place two weeks ago inside her room at the Air Force Administrative College in Coimbatore's Redfields. On the day of the assault, the woman said she had injured herself while playing. She then took some medication before going to sleep in her room. She woke up later that to find she had been sexually assaulted. She said she was forced to go to the police because she was not satisfied with action taken by the IAF. Twice, she said, she was made to submit a withdrawal - of the complaint letter - in writing and another time, she was asked to sign a letter with changes made, which she refused to sign. The initial investigation was carried out by an all-women team from the city's Gandhipuram Police Station. A case of sexual assault under section 376 was registered.    "

Hemant Das, known as the ""crowbar man"", was arrested on Monday after being identified as a suspect in three burglary cases in Bhubaneswar, they said. After being arrested, Hemant Das confessed to the crimes, police said. He started as a burglar in 1982 when he was in college after meeting his 'guru' in jail as he was imprisoned for some time over a clash between two groups of students, they said. He used to stay in rooms next to rich people in luxury hotels across the country, and rob them, police said. Hemant Das told police that he used crowbars to break locks and safes, earning him the nickname. Though he started burglary along with his 'guru' after getting out of jail in 1982, for the last 34 years, he operated alone, police said. He splurged most of his ill-gotten money, estimated to be around ₹ 5 crore, on liquor and prostitution, police said. ""I operated alone and took women from Kolkata during tours to other cities. I frequently visited Mumbai, Chennai and other cities and booked rooms in star hotels,"" Hemant Das told reporters at a press conference in Bhubaneswar. He said his main target has always been cash and not gold as he feared that stealing other valuables may lead to his arrest. Bhubaneswar's Deputy Commissioner of Police US Dash said they were tracking him after he was found to be a suspect in three cases of burglary in the Bhubaneswar. He was caught in CCTV in two of these incidents. More than 100 cases are registered against him in the Bhubaneswar alone, police said. He was arrested in 2018 and sent to jail. After being released, he did not go home despite having a family, they said. Hemant Das was again caught last year and sent to jail in Puri. He was released from the jail in July, and three burglary cases were reported from different areas of Bhubaneswar thereafter, police said.   ""I am 59 years old and now I retire from all such activities. I appeal to all my brothers to quit the act of burglary, taking my instance. I earned a lot but now a pauper,"" he said.

Lovepreet Singh, in his dying moments, called his father from his hospital bed and begged him to come quickly. By the time his family reached, it was too late. Lovepreet Singh and three more farmers were among the eight killed in Sunday's violence during a protest against Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra's visit. Four farmers were run over by a car in the minister's convoy. Later, there were clashes and cars were burnt at the spot. Farmers allege that car was being driven by the minister's son, Ashish Mishra. The UP police have filed a case against him. Weeping next to his body in a glass casket, his family today refused to cremate him until they were given the autopsy report and a copy of the FIR against Ashish Mishra. A large number of relatives and neighbours sat next to the body, waiting. ""My son was crushed under a car...They have not taken any action against the person responsible.

Amid rising anger over the incident, the minister and his son have both denied being present at the Lakhimpur Kheri site. A viral video, apparently of the incident, has surfaced and has been tweeted by BJP MP Varun Gandhi and Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, among others. The video apparently shows the horrifying moment when an SUV drove into a group of protesters from behind and crushed many of them.   Reports suggest the post-mortem report of all eight bodies has revealed the cause of death as injuries, shock and brain haemorrhage.

The Election Commission's move today comes days after their feud led to a freeze on the Lok Janshakti Party's name and symbol (a bungalow). Ahead of the by polls in Bihar for two seats - Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur seats on October 30 - the Election Commission had responded to competing claims by the two sides with the move against the LJP, founded in 2000 by former Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, Chirag Paswan's father. While Chirag Paswan, 38, has got the party name he requested - Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) and 'helicopter' as the symbol, Pasupati Paras been allotted the party name - Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party - and his party symbol is a 'sewing machine', the Election Commission said in separate statements.

The plea arises out of a 2019 split verdict. On February 14, 2019, a two judge-bench of Justices AK Sikri and Ashok Bhushan, both retired since, recommended to the chief justice of India that a three judge bench be set up to finally decide the issue of control of services in the national capital in view of its split verdict. Justice Bhushan had ruled the Delhi government has no power at all over administrative services. Justice Sikri, however, made a distinction. He said the transfer or posting of officers in top echelons of the bureaucracy (joint director and above) can only be done by the Central government and the view of the lieutenant governor would prevail in case of a difference of opinion for matters relating to other bureaucrats. ""We have to constitute a bench after Dussehra vacation. The plea would be listed after Diwali break,"" a bench of Chief Justice NV Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli told senior advocate Rahul Mehra who mentioned the Delhi government's plea for urgent listing and hearing. Following a five-judge Constitution bench judgement, police, land and public order were to be under the control of the Centre and the rest of the subjects, including the services, should remain under the Delhi government, Mr Mehra said. ""It is the matter pertaining to the issue of services which find mention in Entry 41 of list II of the Constitution. The two-judge bench expressed divergent views and the matter was before a three-judge judge bench. Since the entire administrative control vests currently with the Centre, it is an important issue and impedes on ability of Delhi government to govern and implement its policy,"" the counsel for the Delhi government added. Earlier, the top court, which was hearing pleas on six matters pertaining to a long-running conflict between the Centre and the Delhi government, had given a unanimous order on the remaining five issues except the control over services. Both judges had agreed that the lieutenant governor will have control over the Anti-Corruption Bureau, as already notified by the Centre, and the power to appoint inquiry commissions would also rest with the Central government. On the other hand, the elected Delhi government will have the right to appoint public prosecutors, to decide land revenue matters and also to appoint or deal with electricity commission or board, the bench had ruled. It had unanimously upheld the Centre's notification that its employees cannot be probed in corruption cases by the ACB, which is part of the Delhi government but controlled by the Lt Governor. After the difference of opinion on the issue of control of services, the bench had dictated the order and said the matter needs to be referred to a larger bench and views expressed by both the judges should be placed before the Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate bench. On July 4, 2018, the five-judge bench had laid down broad parameters for governance of the national capital, which has witnessed a power struggle between the Centre and the Delhi government since the AAP came to power in 2014. In the landmark verdict, it unanimously held that Delhi cannot be accorded the status of a state. It clipped the powers of the Lt Governor, saying he has no ""independent decision making power"" and has to act on the aid and advice of the elected government.   The Delhi government has been at loggerheads with the present Lt Governor and his predecessor.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesman said Monday that the new round of discussions could begin by early November. Iran's nuclear activity will be at the center of talks between US and Israeli national security teams in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday. Israeli National Security Advisor Eyal Hulata and his White House counterpart, Jake Sullivan, will join a meeting of the US-Israel Strategic Consultative Group, which groups representatives from both countries' diplomatic, military and intelligence agencies. President Joe Biden -- who reversed his predecessor Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States from international negotiations on curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions -- is keen to resolve the standoff diplomatically. ""The path in Vienna for negotiations does remain open,"" the US official said. ""The Iranians are sending indications to a number of parties that they are preparing to come back to Vienna and of course we will have to see whether they reengage in that process constructively or not."" Despite Israeli skepticism, the Biden administration believes ""very strongly that the diplomatic path remains the best,"" the official said. However, the official said the White House and Israel's new government agree that Iran has made rapid advances since Trump quit the international effort to monitor Tehran's nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. Tehran insists that it does not seek nuclear weapons, only an energy industry. ""We have a common assessment of the extent to which Iran's nuclear program has dramatically broken out of the box since the previous administration left the Iran nuclear deal,"" the official said. ""The breakout time, meaning stockpiles of enriched uranium and other ways to look at this, it's gone from about 12 months down to a period of a few months. So obviously that's quite alarming."" The official said the United States believes diplomacy will be ""the best way to put a ceiling on the program and roll back the gains that Iran has made in recent years."" However, there is no movement to lifting sanctions and if diplomacy doesn't work ""there are other avenues.""   ""We think the onus right now is on the Iranian side,"" the official said.

The jury determined that the company failed to take reasonable steps to prevent Owen Diaz, a contract worker who was employed as an elevator operator at Tesla's Fremont factory in 2015 and 2016, from being racially harassed, the newspaper said. In a message to employees that Tesla posted on its website, the automaker noted the trial concerned racial slurs heard on the factory floor and racist graffiti in the bathrooms. It also said the three times that Diaz complained about harassment, Tesla stepped in and made sure action was taken by staffing agencies. The jury awarded Diaz $6.9 million in compensatory damages and $130 million in punitive damages, according to the newspaper. ""While we strongly believe that these facts don't justify the verdict reached by the jury in San Francisco, we do recognize that in 2015 and 2016 we were not perfect,"" Tesla said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters query asking if it would be appealing the verdict. Diaz's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before the trial began, presiding judge William Orrick rejected efforts by Tesla to exclude one juror from the jury, saying he believed the attempt was based on race and ""purposefully discriminatory."" Tesla said in its blog post that since Diaz worked at the Fremont factory it had made changes including the establishment of teams dedicated to investigating employee complaints and to ensuring employees had equal opportunities at the company.   Last year, the electric carmaker disclosed in its first U.S. diversity report that Black employees make up just 4% of Tesla's American leadership roles and 10% of its total workforce in the country.

In her post, the journalist had claimed that Aryan Khan's arrest should be ""a wakeup call for parents"" Aryan Khan was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for alleged possession of banned drugs and substance abuse after officials in disguise raided a rave party on the Cordelia Cruise ship which was on its way to Goa. Eight persons including Aryan Khan were detained on Saturday evening. On Monday, Aryan was denied bail and sent to custody till Thursday by a Mumbai court although in court his lawyer argued that he was a special invitee to the cruise ship and therefore ""cannot be roped in with the entire seizure in the case"".   The anti-drugs bureau said the raids produced a haul of 13 grams of cocaine, 21 grams of charas, 22 pills of MDMA and 5 grams of MD. The drugs were found hidden in clothes, underwear and purses, reported news agency Press Trust of India, quoting an unnamed official of the anti-drugs bureau.

437,Tue Oct 05 05:27:00 +0000 2021,#CryptoWithNDTV | Crypto Concepts And Jargons Demystified By A 'Curious Beginner' https://t.co/laupz6xVxe https://t.co/U3vPdLoMgc,https://www.ndtv.com/business/crypto-concepts-and-jargons-demystified-by-a-curious-beginner-reddit-product-lead-peter-yang-2564038,Crypto Concepts And Jargons Demystified By A 'Curious Beginner',"Crypto or digital currencies' exponential growth stories are very common among the young investors these days, though a few actually understand how the cryptocurrency world functions. Today, there's a very strong aspiration in youngsters around the world to know the crypto process quickly so that they can start minting -- or in this case 'mining' -- money as soon as they can. Consequently, they turn to the internet for answers. But, searching on the web doesn't always help to get the basics right about crypto functioning. Also, watching expert videos and taking cues from analysts may not be helpful sometimes. So, what could be the possible way out? Reddit Product Lead Peter Yang, in his blogpost 'The Curious Beginner's Guide to Crypto', gave a simple answer: ""It's often easier to learn from a curious beginner than an expert who speaks in jargon."" His blog goes by the name, ""Creator Economy"". In his post, Mr Yang -- who calls himself a ""curious beginner"" - said, ""My goal is to 'explain like I'm five' the following (crypto concepts): Web 3; Blockchain; Fungible and non-fungible tokens; Bitcoin and Ethereum; NFTs; and DAOs."" To start with, he quoted American businessman and investor Ben Horowitz: ""Crypto has one feature that has never existed before - trust."" ""If trust can be set by code, then creators don't have to rely on middlemen. They: Don't have to trust banks to get paid; Don't have to trust lawyers to draft a contract; Don't have to trust social networks to make a living."" To validate the above statement, Mr Yang elaborated, ""With trust comes ownership. By reducing the middleman tax, creators and fans can finally own the upside from their work."" Web 3 While explaining the concept of 'Web 3', Mr Yang said: ""The best way to explain Web 3 is to compare it with Web 2. Web 2 is the internet today, dominated by tech giants. It's built off client-server architecture, where users are the client and companies control the servers. These companies extract value from creators and users by sitting in the middle."" He added, ""Web 3 is the internet that's been pioneered by crypto. It's built off peer-to-peer networks of computers that talk to each other without middlemen using blockchain tech."" Blockchain On blockchain, Mr Yang said, ""A blockchain is a linked list of transactions stored on a network of computers. Blockchains are 'Decentralized: Transactions are stored on a network of computers (nodes); 'Immutable: Transactions cannot be changed once committed to the block'; and 'Open: Transactions can be viewed by anyone'. Each block has 'A list of transactions'; 'A hash (a long string of random characters) for the block'; and 'The previous block's hash (this is how the blocks are linked)'."" Citing an example, he wrote, ""Suppose Bob wants to send Mary 1 bitcoin. Both Bob and Mary need crypto wallets. These wallets are either software (e.g., Coinbase, Metamask, Rainbow) or hardware (e.g., Ledger). First, Bob tells his wallet: 'I want to send 1 bitcoin from my public address to Mary's public address.' Second, Bob's wallet produces a digital signature for this transaction based on his private key. And third, this signature proves that Bob actually owns 1 bitcoin. Bob's wallet sends the transaction to nodes on the blockchain network. These nodes then verify the transaction using Bob's signature and public key. A node groups Bob's transaction with other transactions into a block. It then works with other nodes to add the block to the blockchain. Mary will see 1 bitcoin in her wallet only after all three steps are complete."" He further said that, ""The most important takeaway when it comes to wallets and keys is: You can share your public key with others to send and receive transactions. But, you must never share your private key or seed phrase. If someone has access to these artifacts, they'll be able to make transactions on your behalf."" ""A block can be added to the blockchain only if other nodes agree,"" he added. Fungible Tokens To elucidate on 'Fungible vs. Non-fungible tokens', he said: ""Fungible tokens are interchangeable (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether). Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique (e.g., a piece of art). As an example, let's look at a game like Fortnite or Roblox: Fungible tokens are the game's virtual currency (e.g., VBucks, Robux). Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the game's character skins, emotes, and more."" To differentiate between Bitcoin and Ethereum (fungible tokens or cryptocurrencies), he said, ""Bitcoin uses blockchain and therefore is decentralized, immutable, and open. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin."" Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) in 2009. While Ethereum, created in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, he said, is a digital token. ""Ether is a store of value like Bitcoin, but its main purpose is to reward nodes on the ethereum blockchain for processing transactions. Gas is the amount of Ether that's paid to a node to process a transaction,"" he added. Non-Fungible Tokens Explaining non-fungible tokens or NFTs, he said, ""An NFT is a record of ownership of a unique asset. This record lives on the blockchain and is: 'Decentralized: Stored on a network of computers'; 'Immutable: Cannot be changed once committed'; and Open: Anyone can see the transaction history."" DAOs On DAOs, Mr Yang said, ""A DAO is a community with a treasury owned by its contributing members. The simplest way to describe how a DAO works is to compare it to a company.""   Traditional Vs Crypto Economy In conclusion, Mr Yang compared traditional economy with crypto and referred money (US Dollar) as fungible tokens (Bitcoin and Ethereum). He compared factories, machines and software (productive assets) to 'smart contract'; food, clothing & TV (goods) to NFTs; e-commerce, retail stores and stock market (exchange mechanisms) to decentralized exchanges, auctions, order books run by smart contracts; and government, central bank corporations (institutions) to DAOs respectively, in the crypto economy."

Counsellor in India's Permanent Mission to the UN, A Amarnath, said on Monday that India does not need advice from a nation with a proven track record of illicit export of nuclear material and technology. ""Pakistan's desperate attempts to peddle falsehoods and habit of abusing the sanctity of multilateral forums deserves our collective contempt,"" he said. ""Pakistan has made a number of futile and unsubstantiated allegations against India, including in relation to the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. These do not merit a response, as they pertain to matters internal to India,"" Mr Amarnath said. India exercised its Right of Reply after Pakistan's envoy to the UN Munir Akram raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir during the meeting of the General Assembly's First Committee that deals with disarmament and international security issues. Mr Amarnath reiterated that the entire union territory of Jammu and Kashmir was, is and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India. ""This includes the areas that are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan. We call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation,"" he said in the Right of Reply. ""Given its established State practice of hosting, aiding, and actively supporting terrorists, how could one expect any constructive contribution from Pakistan to the First Committee, that deals with important matters of international peace and security,"" Mr Amarnath said. With the Pakistani envoy also referring to India's defence arsenal, New Delhi hit back saying that as a ""responsible State, India strictly abides by its obligations under international treaties and needs no advice from a country, which has a proven track record of illicit export of nuclear material and technology."" ""India's security concerns are not confined to a region and, therefore, India has always approached these issues in a global context,"" he said. He said that in contrast to India's constructive approach on disarmament matters, Pakistan has only been ""disruptive"". Mr Amarnath said it is 25 years now that the world is paying the price of Pakistan's obstructionist tactics in the CD (Conference on Disarmament) that have not allowed the conference to adopt a Programme of Work. Pakistan has the dubious distinction of having single handedly blocked the negotiations on Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT), including in 2009, when the Conference on Disarmament adopted a consensus Programme of Work, he said. ""Having joined the consensus on the Programme of Work, Pakistan revealed its true character by soon taking a complete U-turn and blocking any work by the CD,"" Mr Amarnath said. Pakistan, as the ""epicenter"" of global terrorism, is the biggest destabilising force in the world and has repeatedly indulged in cross-border terrorism, Mr Amarnath said. ""They have no regard for UN principles. While Pakistan's Permanent Representative speaks about peace and security here, his Prime Minister glorifies global terrorists like Osama bin Ladin as 'martyrs''.  What more could be a better proof of the utter duplicity that this country is infamous for?"" he asked. Amarnath asserted that the General Assembly's First Committee is ""not the forum"" to address bilateral or regional issues as it has a vast agenda dealing with global issues relating to disarmament and international security. ""We wish to reiterate that regional security issues have no place in the First Committee's considerations,"" he said. He said the Committee should not only categorically reject Pakistan's ""nefarious and vicious designs"" but collectively condemn Pakistan for its repeated efforts to politicise its work and hijack its mandate. Mr Amarnath said in the Right of Reply that India expects nothing new from Pakistan that harbours a ""deep sense of insecurity and orchestrated hatred"" for India and ""our secular credentials and the values that my country stands for. ""However, despite its hopeless efforts, the world is able to see through its deceit and double-speak. It is time to hold Pakistan to account and not let them abuse UN platforms for spreading disinformation, hate and incite violence,"" he said. Mr Amarnath said Pakistan's baseless accusations against India are ""indeed rich, coming from a nation that is encouraging sectarian violence against Muslims and suppresses the rights of minorities.""   ""Going by its past practice and compulsive obsession with India, Pakistan may exercise its Right of Reply and continue its malicious false propaganda against my country. But I shall refrain from responding to it, out of respect for the work of the First Committee,"" he said.

If successful, the Russian crew will beat a Hollywood project that was announced earlier this year by ""Mission Impossible"" star Tom Cruise together with NASA and Elon Musk's SpaceX. Actress Yulia Peresild, 37, and film director Klim Shipenko, 38, are expected to take off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan at 0855 GMT. Led by veteran cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, they will travel in a Soyuz MS-19 spaceship for a 12-day mission at the International Space Station (ISS) to film scenes for ""The Challenge"". The movie's plot, which has been mostly kept under wraps along with its budget, was revealed by Russia's space agency Roscosmos to centre around a female surgeon who is dispatched to the ISS to save an astronaut. Clad in a flight suit, director Shipenko called the film ""an experiment"" at an online press conference on Monday. ""Some things will work out and some things won't,"" he conceded. Shipenko and Peresild are expected to return to Earth on October 17 in a capsule with cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky, who has been on the ISS for the past six months. The launch comes at a challenging time for Russia's space industry, which is struggling to secure state funding with the Kremlin prioritising military spending. Compared to the Soviet era -- when Moscow launched the first satellite Sputnik and sent the first man, Yuri Gagarin, into space -- Russia has struggled to innovate. Russians 'lost interest' in space Its space agency is still reliant on Soviet-designed technology and has faced a number of setbacks, including corruption scandals and botched launches. Russia is also falling behind in the global space race, facing tough competition from the United States and China, with Beijing showing growing ambitions in the industry. Roscosmos was also dealt a blow after SpaceX last year successfully delivered astronauts to the ISS, costing Russia its monopoly for journeys to the orbital station. But for political analyst Konstantin Kalachev, the space film is a matter of PR and a way to ""distract"" Russians from the ""problems"" that Roscosmos is facing. ""This is supposed to inspire Russians, show how cool we are, but I think Russians have completely lost interest in the space industry,"" Kalachev told AFP. In a bid to spruce up its image and diversify its revenue, Russia revealed this year that it will be reviving its space tourism programme to ferry fee-paying adventurers to the ISS. After a decade-long pause, Russia will send two Japanese tourists -- including billionaire Yusaku Maezawa -- to the ISS in December, capping a year that has been a milestone for amateur space travel. Last month, SpaceX completed the first all-civilian mission to space that took four untrained astronauts on a three-day loop around the Earth's orbit.   The trip followed the missions of billionaire Richard Branson, who spent several minutes in weightlessness in July, and of Amazon-founder Jeff Bezos completing a similar mission just days later.

Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the incident on Sunday. The video, being shared widely on social media, is yet to be verified by the police. NDTV cannot independently verify its authenticity. It is also not clear from the visuals who is in the driving seat. Earlier today, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted the viral clip with a pointed question for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""@narendramodi Sir, your government has kept me in custody for the last 28 hours without any order and FIR. This person who crushed the annadata (farmers) has not been arrested yet. Why?"" tweeted Priyanka Gandhi this morning. In the 25-second video clip, the SUV rams protesters, who fall to the ground, while others scramble to get out of the way. Another vehicle, with sirens blaring, is seen tailing the SUV that hit the farmers. The video matches descriptions given to NDTV on Sunday by farmers at the spot, who said the car suddenly hit them from behind. The make and colour of the lead SUV that hits the farmers also matches other visuals from the site. The farmers have alleged that the protesters were run over by an SUV driven by Union Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra's son Ashish Mishra. Both the Minister and his son have denied even being at the spot. The incident took place when a group of protesting farmers in Tikonia area of Kheri tried to block Mr Mishra and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya from visiting. The protesters were upset over a recent speech by Mr Mishra. The farmers claimed the violence broke out after a car in the minister's convoy ran over protesters. Visuals from the area showed arson and vehicles set on fire. A murder case has been filed against the Union minister's son.   Minister Ajay Mishra says he is not aware about any FIR against his son. He has also denied that his son was linked to the violence. ""My son wasn't present at the spot. There were miscreants who attacked workers with sticks and swords. Had my son been there, he wouldn't have come out alive,"" Mr Mishra, the junior Home Minister, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. ""My son was present at the venue of the (Deputy Chief Minister's) event... all through, I was accompanying the deputy chief minister,"" he said.

The province's purchase of polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, testing equipment, which allows scientists to amplify DNA samples to test for infectious disease or other genetic material, shot upward in 2019, with most of the increase coming in the second half of the year, the Australian-U.S. firm Internet 2.0 found. Hubei province is home to Wuhan, the large Chinese city where the first known cases of the virus emerged. The World Health Organization reported that its China Country Office was informed on Dec. 31, 2019, that cases of pneumonia from an unknown cause had been detected in the city. On Jan. 7, 2020, Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus one that would become known as SARS-CoV-2 and cause the illness now called Covid-19. Since then, it has spread to virtually every corner of the world, and more than 230 million people have been infected and nearly 4.8 million have died. Based on the research, Internet 2.0 concluded with ""high confidence that the pandemic began much earlier than China informed the WHO about Covid-19,"" according to the report. The cybersecurity firm, which specializes in digital forensics and intelligence analysis, called for further investigation. But several medical experts said the Internet 2.0 report wasn't enough information to draw such conclusions. For one thing, PCR testing, which has been in broad use for several decades, has been been growing in popularity as it has become a standard method to test for pathogens, according to one of the experts. In addition, PCR equipment is widely used in laboratories to test for many other pathogens beside Covid-19, including in animals, and is commonly found in modern hospitals and labs. China was also dealing with an outbreak of African swine fever across the country in 2019. China's Foreign Ministry disputed the findings. In a response to Bloomberg News, a spokesperson said the findings fall into the same category as other dubious claims about the origins of the coronavirus, including a ""so-called paper"" that analyzed traffic volumes near several hospitals in Wuhan and searched for the keywords ""cough"" and ""diarrhea"" before concluding that the outbreak began in Wuhan as early as August 2019. ""Virus traceability is a serious scientific issue that should be addressed by scientists,"" the spokesperson said. China's State Council Information Office published a white paper on the country's actions to combat Covid-19 that with ""a clear timeline and iron-clad facts"" chronicles its efforts to fight the epidemic, the spokesperson said. ""China's anti-epidemic campaign is open to the world, the situation is clear, the facts are clear at a glance, and stand the test of time and history,"" the spokesperson said. Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said he didn't know why purchases in Hubei province specifically had increased at the time. But he said it wasn't so surprising because in general purchases of PCR equipment have been growing, even pre-Covid, as it has become ""the methodology of choice for pathogen detection."" Adalja, whose work focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness, said the data wasn't specific enough to sway the conversation on Covid's origins. ""I don't think it adds anything plus or minus,"" he said. ""It's not enough."" An Australian biochemist who has read the report and has requested anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said more data was needed to explain the procurement numbers. The biochemist, who has a strong background in PCR and research application and immunology, said the data spoke to a sudden, significant need for pathogen diagnostic equipment, but he said it only raised questions about what the equipment was being used to test. David Robinson, Internet 2.0's co-chief executive officer and the lead researcher on the paper, said in an interview that the timing of some of the contracts, and the agencies behind the purchases, lend credence to the idea that officials in Hubei province were investigating a new human disease throughout the latter half of 2019. However, he said his firm's findings weren't a smoking gun. ""This data does not support any origins conclusions on Covid-19 but in the future some part of this data might support an origins finding,"" according to a statement by Robinson and Robert Potter, the other co-CEO. ""Nor does this report identify a specific point in time where a pandemic emerged. The fact China has gone to great lengths to ensure conclusive evidence is unobtainable means unfortunately we may have to rely on third-party data points."" Virus Origins The origins of the coronavirus have become a hotly contested issue, with the U.S. and its allies accusing Beijing of resisting a more thorough investigation, including into allegations that the virus escaped from a Wuhan biosecurity lab where similar coronaviruses have been studied. In August, U.S. intelligence officials released a summary of an investigation into the causes of the outbreak but said they weren't able to reach firm conclusions because China refused to cooperate. Chinese officials denied that they had hindered the probe and have vehemently rebutted the Wuhan lab leak theory. Top Chinese science officials have said the pathogen most likely arose in an animal, which transmitted it to humans via an intermediate host a theory given most credence by the wider scientific community as well. In an April article in Science, researchers concluded that mid-October to mid-November 2019 was the most plausible period in which the first case of a person contracting Covid-19 emerged in Hubei province. Internet 2.0, which counts the Australian government among its clients, shared its data with government officials from the so-called ""Five Eyes"" countries, the group of intelligence-sharing nations comprised of Australia, the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and New Zealand, according to the firm and other sources. Representatives from the intelligence services of those countries declined to comment when asked about the report. Robinson, a retired Australian Army intelligence officer, said Internet 2.0's report is based on purchasing data that is publicly available on Chinese government websites. The data is routinely scraped by an aggregator website, called bidcenter.com.cn, and Internet 2.0's researchers searched for the term PCR across the database. In all, they collected 1,716 procurement contracts from 2007 to the end of 2019, and then spent months checking and analyzing the data, Robinson said. A control sample was taken from China's provinces and cities, and the top areas for PCR procurement were compared to Hubei to rule out that an increase was occurring across China. PCR-related purchases were relatively flat or went up or down slightly in most of the other areas. However, purchases shot up in 2019 in Beijing, according to the report, which doesn't break down purchases in provinces outside of Hubei by month. In Hubei province, spending on PCR equipment started inching upward in 2014. But the jump was particularly big in 2019, to 67.36 million yuan from 36.7 million yuan the year before. Robinson said the type of Chinese organizations making big purchases of PCR equipment changed in 2019, compared to the previous year, from mainly agricultural research and hospital use to largely disease prevention and control institutions. In 2019, for instance, the Wuhan University of Science and Technology was the biggest purchaser in Hubei province. The university is affiliated with eight hospitals and has more than 35 teaching practice bases, including 22 general hospitals and 10 disease prevention and control centers, according to the report. Robinson highlighted three particular purchases in Hubei province that he described as ""out of trend"" and suggested that Chinese officials were dealing with a novel human pathogen earlier in 2019 than previously disclosed. The first purchase happened in May 2019, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army Airborne Hospital bought PCR-related equipment, the only contract from the PLA in the database, Robinson said. The second one occurred in September 2019, when the Wuhan Hongshan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention made two purchases of pathogen detection equipment for the upcoming Military World Games. The next month, more than 9,000 international athletes from more than 100 countries traveled to Wuhan and many of them later got sick with Covid-19-like symptoms, the Washington Post reported in June. China later claimed the U.S. Army athletes may have brought the virus with them from Fort Detrick in Maryland, where the Army does bioresearch, the Post said.   The third ""out of trend"" purchase happened in November 2019, according to the report. The Wuhan Institute of Virology where proponents of the lab leak theory allege the virus emerged from bought PCR-related equipment. ""These findings challenge existing assumptions around when the pandemic began and support further investigation,"" the report said."
446,Tue Oct 05 04:40:03 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: Energy Crisis Deepens In India With Four Days of Coal Reserves Left https://t.co/xrbdZ7HVBb https://t.co/RqtqQz1gvR,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/energy-crisis-deepens-in-india-with-four-days-of-coal-reserves-left-2564111,"Four Days Of Coal Reserves Left In India, Energy Crisis Deepens","The worsening squeeze on India's coal supply is triggering a power crisis that's threatening to stall the world's fastest-expanding major economy. Coal-fired power stations had an average of four days' worth of stock of the fuel at the end of last month, the lowest level in years, and down from 13 days at the start of August. More than half the plants are on alert for outages.  With coal used to produce almost 70% of electricity, spot power rates have surged, while supplies of the fuel are being diverted away from key customers including aluminum smelters and steel mills. Like China, India is contending with two key challenges: soaring electricity demand as industrial activity rebounds after pandemic curbs were lifted and a slump in local coal output. The country meets around three-quarters of its demand locally, but heavy rains have flooded mines and key transport routes. Operators of coal-fired plants are facing a dilemma -- pay large premiums at domestic auctions to secure any available local supply or wade into a seaborne coal market where prices have soared to the highest on record. Already, the nation's government is drawing up guidelines in case it needs to bring idle power stations back into action. ""Until supplies stabilize completely, we are likely to see power outages in some pockets, while customers elsewhere may be asked to pay more for power,"" said Pranav Master, director for infrastructure advisory at credit ratings firm Crisil Ltd. ""Because of imported coal prices shooting through the roof, plants running on domestic coal have had to do a lot of heavy-lifting. Things are expected to get better as the rains abate.""  The impact on consumer prices would show up a few months later, when distribution utilities get regulatory approvals to pass on the cost, he said. Coal inventories at Indian power plants fell to around 8.1 million tons at the end of September, about 76% less than a year earlier, according to government data. Average spot power prices at the Indian Energy Exchange Ltd. jumped more than 63% in September to 4.4 rupees ($0.06) a kilowatt hour.  Aluminum producers are among major power users that complained after state-run miner Coal India Ltd. curbed supplies of the fuel to heavy industry to prioritize deliveries to electricity generators.  The rising electricity bills are likely to put a dent in India's stellar growth rate. The economy is forecast to expand 9.4% in the year through March 2022, which would be the fastest pace among major global economies, according to a Bloomberg News survey. The energy crunch is a reminder of the vital role coal plays in India's economy, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi targets a huge increase in renewables and the nation's top billionaires rush to add green investments. Consumption of the fuel is forecast to increase in the next few years and India, among the world's top greenhouse gas emitters, is yet to set a target to get to carbon neutrality.  Supplies to power plants are currently short by between 60,000 and 80,000 tons a day on the impact of the prolonged rains that have drenched coal pits, said Anil Kumar Jain, India's coal secretary. Unusually heavy downpours last month in Dhanbad, a major coal mining center in the east of the country, have worsened the situation, he said.  Coal India should be able to increase supplies enough by the second week of October to cover the deficit at power plants, although that will depend on the weather, Jain said. However, it will take much longer to replenish the badly depleted stockpiles.   --With assistance from Cynthia Li.

This is the third consecutive day that the opposition has been targeting the BJP government in UP and at the centre over the violence that erupted in Lakhimpur district, about 440 km from Delhi, as eight people - including four farmers - were allegedly run over by a car. Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Kumar Mishra's son Ashish Mishra is the only person named in the murder case. ""Jise hirasat me rakha hai, woh darti nahi - sacchi Congressi hai.

She further said, yet again, that she was arrested while no action has been taken against the Union Minister's son, who is an accused. She also questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi if he would visit the district where restrictions have been imposed on movement and the use of mobile internet after Sunday's violence. Taking a dig at the UP government, she said, ""Detain me for six months or six years.... no problem.""  ""Without an order or FIR, I have been held in custody for more than 28 hours,"" Ms Vadra said in a tweet. She also posted a video:  On Monday, several opposition leaders, including Akhilesh Yadav, were detained amid widespread protests against what happened in Lakhimpur.    Haryana, Punjab and Delhi also saw demonstrations by farmers as they demanded action against the Minister's son.  Mr Mishra, however, has denied that he was in the car that allegedly ran over eight people. ""I was not in the car. I was at my paternal home in Banwirpur village where a wrestling match was being organised. I was there from the morning till the end of the event,"" he told NDTV.

The Congress general secretary followed it up with a pointed question for the Prime Minister. ""@narendramodi Sir, your government has kept me in custody for the last 28 hours without any order and FIR. This person who crushed the annadata (farmers) has not been arrested yet. Why?"" Priyanka Gandhi asked this morning, tweeting a viral video clip which appears to show farmers being run over by an SUV. The Prime Minister is yet to speak on the violence in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress leader, who said she had been ""illegally held"" indefinitely by the Uttar Pradesh government for over 24 hours, followed her earlier tweet with a video message for the Prime Minister. This time holding up a mobile phone and playing the video in full, asking why the Union minister has not been removed as yet. Yesterday, leaders cutting across party lines were stopped from visiting the area, with the police even writing to the Lucknow airport to not allow the flights carrying Congress leaders to land. The video, being shared widely on social media, is yet to be verified by the police. NDTV cannot independently verify its authenticity. In the 25-second video clip, one can see farmers falling to the ground as the vehicle rams them, while others scramble to get out of the way. Another vehicle, with sirens blaring, is seen tailing the SUV that rammed the farmers. Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the violence on Sunday. The video matches descriptions given to NDTV by farmers at the spot who said the vehicle suddenly hit them from behind. The make and colour of the lead SUV that rams the farmers in the video also matches other visuals from the site. On Sunday, a group of protesting farmers in Tikonia area of Kheri tried to block Union Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya from visiting. The protesters were upset over a recent speech by Mr Mishra. The farmers claimed the violence broke out after a car in the minister's convoy ran over protesters. Visuals from the area showed arson and vehicles set on fire. They have alleged that the car was driven by the Union Minister's son Ashish. It is not clear from the viral video clip who is in the driving seat. A murder case has been filed against the Minister's son but he is yet to be arrested. Both the Minister and his son have denied even being at the spot.   The Uttar Pradesh government has promised to pay a compensation of ₹ 45 lakh to the families of those who died. The injured will receive a compensation of ₹ 10 lakh. A retired judge will investigate the matter, the state government has said. "

Molnupiravir, which would be the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19 if it gets regulatory approval, could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalised for people most at risk of contracting severe COVID-19, according to experts. ""These treatments mean that we are going to be able to live with the virus,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Nine News on Tuesday as Australia aims to reopen its borders next month for fully vaccinated citizens and permanent residents. Molnupiravir capsules have to be taken twice a day for five days by adult patients for a course of 10, Morrison said. The drug is expected to be available in Australia by early next year if approved by the country's drug regulator, Morrison said. Merck expects to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of 2021. South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia have all said they are in talks to buy the potential treatment, while the Philippines is running a trial on the pill. Australia, meanwhile, is stepping up its vaccination rate, with Sydney and Melbourne, its largest cities, and the capital Canberra enduring a weeks-long lockdown to combat the highly infectious Delta variant. The national first-dose rate in the adult population topped 80% on Tuesday morning. A total of 1,763 new infections were reported in Victoria, exceeding the previous daily high of 1,488 on Saturday, with the state looking to start reopening once full vaccination levels in its adult population reaches 70%, expected around the end of October, from 53% now. Dominic Perrottet, who was elected as the new premier of New South Wales on Tuesday, said the state was on track to exit lockdown on Oct. 11, the first Monday after it expects 70% of its population over 16 to be fully vaccinated. Daily infections in the state fell to the lowest in seven weeks on Tuesday at 608 new cases, the majority in state capital Sydney, down from 623 on Monday. Seven new deaths were recorded.   Even with the Delta outbreaks, Australia still has relatively low coronavirus numbers, with around 115,800 cases. Total deaths stood at 1,357, with the mortality rate from the current Delta outbreak lower than during last year due to higher inoculation among the vulnerable population.

A news report on the website of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) said that 836 peacekeepers from India were recently honoured with the United Nations medal “for their committed service to the cause of durable peace in the world's youngest nation.” UNMISS Force Commander Lieutenant General Shailesh Tinaikar lauded the Indian battalion for successfully completing its tour of duty and also praised efforts by the Indian peacekeepers in rescuing and sheltering 32 humanitarian personnel in Renk and ensuring their safe evacuation to Juba, the news report said. “When all of you arrived in Upper Nile state, it was a time of great flux,” the news report quoted Tinaikar as saying. “You had to assume operational responsibility immediately with the threat of imminent intercommunal clashes looming over you. Your presence and patrolling acted as a much-needed deterrent at the time, enabling civilians to go about their daily lives without fear,” it said. India's Ambassador to South Sudan Vishnu Sharma, who was the guest of honour at the medal parade, said the courage, commitment and sacrifice by the Indian peacekeepers for the cause of lasting peace in South Sudan is a “beacon of hope for the communities you are on the ground to serve. You have done the United Nations and your country very proud”. According to the UNMISS news article, Mr Sharma also noted the contribution of Indian veterinarians who treated thousands of animals and ""built capacities among livestock owners on animal management, thereby boosting their economic stability”. Colonel Neeraj Tiwari, Commander of the Indian battalion, expressed hope that the Indian peacekeepers will be remembered for leaving a positive legacy of peace and capacity building, according to the news report. “We wish the South Sudanese the very best as they progress in building sustainable peace from the grassroots to the very highest levels of society,” the report quoted Tiwari as saying. The Acting Head of the UNMISS Field Office in Malakal Christian Mikala voiced appreciation for the peacekeepers' consistent engagements with local communities. “You have been instrumental in extensive patrolling in your area of responsibilities and have built a relationship of trust and confidence with communities across Upper Nile,” the article quoted Mikala as saying. “You should all wear your medals with pride.”   As of August 2021, a total of 19,101 uniformed personnel are deployed with UNMISS. India is currently the second highest troop contributing country to the mission with 2,389 military personnel deployed and an additional 30 police personnel posted with UNMISS.

Facebook suffered a six-hour outagethat spanned its WhatsApp messenger, the main social network and photo-sharing app Instagram, shutting out many of its 2.7 billion global users. The situation idled some of the company's employees and prompted a public apology from the chief technology officer.   Facebook's loss turned into a gain for other social media. Twitter Inc.'s network stayed online, with Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey tweeting his endorsement of Signal as a suitable WhatsApp alternative and amplifying Snowden's urging of his followers to move away from the Facebook-owned app. Thousands of rooms on audio-chat app Clubhouse had people talking about the outage, a spokeswoman for the service said, adding that all its main metrics rose. Signal's focus on privacy -- expressed in its policy to not collect any data on its users and thus avoid situations where governments may pressure it to disclose personally identifiable information -- has made it a favorite for secure communications.

""Why is the opposition arrested without any order and a man who has committed such a horrendous crime... he is not arrested? PM Modi, arrest him, not people like us,"" Priyanka Gandhi told NDTV from a government guest house in Sitapur, where she has been detained since early Monday morning. On Tuesday, Uttar Pradesh officers said a case had been registered against Priyanka Gandhi and others ""related to preventive detention for breach of peace"".

She was also reportedly not allowed to meet her counsel who had waited ""at the gate"" of the detention centre since morning. According to a list on social media, 11 people have been named in the FIR. The Congress says eight of them were not even present at the time and one man had just brought Priyanka Gandhi's clothes from Lucknow. Earlier today, Priyanka Gandhi said she was ready to stay ""15 days, 20 days, six months or even six years..."" in detention.

Eight people, including four farmers, were killed. Farmers protested with the bodies in glass cases much of yesterday, alleging that the SUV was driven by Union Minister Mishra's son Ashish Mishra. The UP police have filed an FIR against him listing murder charges but he has yet to be arrested. Both the Minister and his son have denied they were present at the spot during the incident.

Priyanka Gandhi tweeted the video with a question for PM Modi: ""@narendramodi Sir, your government has kept me in custody for the last 28 hours without any order and FIR. This person who crushed the annadata (farmers) has not been arrested yet. Why?"" Speaking to NDTV, Priyanka Gandhi said the first thing she would do when released from detention was to meet with the families of the dead farmers. She was heading to Lakhimpur Kheri for the purpose on Sunday night when she was stopped and arrested in the early hours of Monday. Lashing out at the BJP for calling her a political opportunist, Priyanka Gandhi retorted: ""Each person of this country... each child knows who the biggest political opportunist is. They try to undermine us and our politics, saying it is nothing serious. But I am very serious and I work seriously. I don't sit in a jhoola (swing) with the Chinese President. I don't visit Japan...

It is my job to raise issues, to stand for people, and to be the voice of the people. Farmers have been protesting for months on end, it is the farmer's son who is protecting our borders. If every opposition party had not tried to visit Lakhimpur Kheri, would the state government have acted at all?"" Priyanka Gandhi also reacted to the Supreme Court yesterday questioning the farmers' protest continuing even after the farm laws that they are opposing have been challenged in court.

Ambassador Pankaj Sharma, Permanent Representative of India to the Conference on Disarmament (CD), Geneva, said India has been drawing the attention of the world towards these threats and the need to strengthen international cooperation to address them through its annual consensus UNGA resolution titled 'Measures to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction''. ""We are deeply concerned about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, which endangers international peace and security. The possibility of terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction necessitates Member States to work together to address this grave danger,"" he said at the General Debate of the First Committee of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly on Monday. He asserted that weapons in the hands of terrorists are the most threatening form of illicit small arms and light weapons. ""Therefore, India values the full and effective implementation of the UN PoA as a means to combat terrorism and transnational crime,"" Mr Sharma said at the session of the First Committee, which deals with disarmament and international security issues. Under the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects (PoA), governments agreed to improve national small arms laws, import/export controls, and stockpile management - and to engage in cooperation and assistance, the UN said. In 2005, they also adopted the International Tracing Instrument (ITI), which ""requires States to ensure that weapons are properly marked and that records are kept. Moreover, It provides a framework for cooperation in weapons tracing - fulfilling one of the commitments governments made in the Programme of Action. Improving weapons tracing is now part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,"" the UN Office For Disarmament Affairs said. Mr Sharma also said that India's annual resolutions at the UN General Assembly, namely the ''Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons'' and ''Reducing Nuclear Danger'' that enjoy the support of the majority of the Member States have consistently highlighted the need for the CD to commence negotiations to reach agreement on an international convention prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and urgent steps to reduce the risks of unintentional and accidental use of nuclear weapons, respectively. He told the session that India is firmly committed to the goal of universal, non-discriminatory and verifiable nuclear disarmament. India's proposal for a step-by-step approach for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, contained in its Working Paper submitted to the Conference on Disarmament in 2007, calls on the Conference on Disarmament to negotiate a Comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Convention. ""As the world's single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, as mandated by the Special Session on Disarmament (SSOD)-1, the Conference on Disarmament needs the requisite political will to agree on a comprehensive and balanced programme of work and to commence negotiations on legally binding instruments on the core items on its agenda,"" Mr Sharma said. He said India is a responsible nuclear weapon State and is committed as per its nuclear doctrine, to maintain credible, minimum deterrence with the posture of no-first use and non-use against non-nuclear weapon States. He said that without diminishing the priority India attaches to disarmament, New Delhi has supported the immediate commencement of negotiations in the CD of a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) on the basis of CD/1299 and the mandate contained in it. As per the CD/1299, the Conference on Disarmament decides to establish an ad hoc committee on a ""ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices"". The Conference directs the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. India supports the full and effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and emphasises the strengthening of the OPCW to fulfill its important mandate. Mr Sharma also voiced India's support for the institutional strengthening of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) including through the negotiation of a comprehensive and legally binding protocol, providing for an effective, universal and non-discriminatory verification mechanism for the BWC. ""India supports efforts for improving the effectiveness of the BWC and strengthening its implementation and universalisation,"" he said. ""As we approach the Ninth Review Conference of the BWC in 2022, States Parties have the important responsibility to work together, build convergences and achieve tangible outcomes that will determine the focus of work for the next five-year inter sessional period and beyond,"" he said.

Priyanka Gandhi, Arrested, Asks","Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said today she had been ""illegally held"" by the Uttar Pradesh government for over 24 hours and targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not acting against a Union Minister whose son is accused of running over farmers at a protest in Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday. ""Why is the opposition arrested without any order and a man who has committed such a horrendous crime... he is not arrested? PM Modi, arrest him, not people like us,"" Priyanka Gandhi told NDTV from a government guest house in Sitapur, where she has been detained since early Monday morning. On Tuesday, Uttar Pradesh officers said a case had been registered against Priyanka Gandhi and others ""related to preventive detention for breach of peace"". But sources close to the Congress leader said she had not been served any order and not shown an FIR either. She was also reportedly not allowed to meet her counsel who had waited ""at the gate"" of the detention centre since morning. According to a list on social media, 11 people have been named in the FIR. The Congress says eight of them were not even present at the time and one man had just brought Priyanka Gandhi's clothes from Lucknow. Earlier today, Priyanka Gandhi said she was ready to stay ""15 days, 20 days, six months or even six years..."" in detention. The Congress leader questioned PM Modi's visit to Lucknow for an event linked to the Independence Day anniversary - ""Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav"". ""Modi-ji is celebrating Azadi (freedom). Who gave us freedom? The farmers gave us freedom. What moral authority do you have to celebrate in Lucknow and not sack your minister and arrest his son? This government does not have the moral authority to continue if this minister continues,"" Priyanka Gandhi lashed out. ""Modi-ji, will you go to Lakhimpur Kheri?"" On Sunday, farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri - a four-hour drive from Lucknow - were protesting the visit of Union Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra for an event when an SUV in his convoy rammed a group of protesters. Eight people, including four farmers, were killed. Farmers protested with the bodies in glass cases much of yesterday, alleging that the SUV was driven by Union Minister Mishra's son Ashish Mishra. The UP police have filed an FIR against him listing murder charges but he has yet to be arrested. Both the Minister and his son have denied they were present at the spot during the incident. A video, apparently of the incident, has gone viral though its authenticity is not confirmed. Priyanka Gandhi tweeted the video with a question for PM Modi: ""@narendramodi Sir, your government has kept me in custody for the last 28 hours without any order and FIR. This person who crushed the annadata (farmers) has not been arrested yet. Why?"" Speaking to NDTV, Priyanka Gandhi said the first thing she would do when released from detention was to meet with the families of the dead farmers. She was heading to Lakhimpur Kheri for the purpose on Sunday night when she was stopped and arrested in the early hours of Monday. Lashing out at the BJP for calling her a political opportunist, Priyanka Gandhi retorted: ""Each person of this country... each child knows who the biggest political opportunist is. They try to undermine us and our politics, saying it is nothing serious. But I am very serious and I work seriously. I don't sit in a jhoola (swing) with the Chinese President. I don't visit Japan... The PM travels the world and he is the biggest tourist.""   She added: ""I belong to a political party that opposes the government. It is my job to raise issues, to stand for people, and to be the voice of the people. Farmers have been protesting for months on end, it is the farmer's son who is protecting our borders. If every opposition party had not tried to visit Lakhimpur Kheri, would the state government have acted at all?"" Priyanka Gandhi also reacted to the Supreme Court yesterday questioning the farmers' protest continuing even after the farm laws that they are opposing have been challenged in court. ""This country is a democracy and the right to protest is a fundamental right of every citizen in the country.  This right is being destroyed in our country under the BJP government,"" she said."

The protests come in the wake of violence in Lakhimpur and a video which surfaced today apparently showing an SUV running over slogan-shouting farmers marching in the area on Sunday. The farmers have alleged that the protesters were run over by an SUV driven by Union Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra's son Ashish Mishra. Both the minister and his son have denied even being at the spot. The video, being shared widely on social media, is yet to be verified by the police. Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the incident on Sunday. The incident took place when a group of protesting farmers in Tikonia area of Kheri tried to block Mr Mishra and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya from visiting. The protesters were upset over a recent speech by Mr Mishra. The farmers claimed the violence broke out after a car in the minister's convoy ran over protesters. Visuals from the area showed arson and vehicles set on fire. Hours ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lucknow visit, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted the viral video of the SUV running over farmers. The Congress leader also said she had been ""illegally held"" indefinitely by the Uttar Pradesh government for over 38 hours after she tried to visit Lakhimpur Kheri."

""This disruption to network traffic had a cascading effect on the way our data centers communicate, bringing our services to a halt,"" Facebook vice president of infrastructure Santosh Janardhan said in a post. Cyber security expert Brian Krebs described what happened as Facebook taking away ""the map telling the world's computers how to find its various online properties."" In addition to the disruption to people, businesses and others that rely on the company's tools, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took a financial hit. Fortune's billionaire tracking website late Monday said Zuckerberg's personal fortune plunged by nearly $6 billion from the prior day to land at just under $117 billion. For Facebook's rivals, it was a good day, however. The messaging service Telegram went from the 56th most downloaded free app in the US to the fifth, according to specialist firm SensorTower. The encrypted messaging app Signal tweeted that ""millions"" of new users had joined, and added that it was ""Signal and ready to mignal."" It was not the only Twitter user to crack jokes over the outage, though others complained about being cut off from contacts, their sources of income or business tools.   Some were philosophical, however -- such as Cindy Bennett, a baker in New York City, who told AFP: ""I think the world would probably be a better place if everybody didn't know what everybody else was doing every second of every minute of every day.""

458,Tue Oct 05 03:03:20 +0000 2021,#Blog: Why G-23 Cannot Dent The Gandhis For Now - by Aunindyo Chakravarty (@AunindyoC) https://t.co/4YLAiJnKPQ https://t.co/cgYzOYPjn1,https://www.ndtv.com/blog/blog-rahul-gandhi-is-right-to-ignore-g-23-for-now-2563478#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories,Blog: Why G-23 Cannot Dent The Gandhis For Now,"The battle between Rahul Gandhi and the G-23 is not just a turf war. It is a battle for personal political survival. We will not understand this if we only look it from the point of view of party politics. Realpolitik is much more than that. The political system consists of not just what is visible to us, but the entire system of power that helps parties win. The biggest role played here is of the various national and regional elites - big corporates, the babudom, judicial officers, media, public intellectuals, urban power-brokers, big landlords and even foreign companies, funds and institutions. It is only when a significant proportion of these disparate elites stand behind a political party that it can come to power. Of course, in democracies, political parties rule in the name of the people. And in India, the people are overwhelmingly poor. The rule of the elites thus has to be mediated through an electoral process that can mobilise the poor behind a programme that ultimately reproduces the system. So a successful political party needs to forge an invisible coaltion between the ruling elites and the voting poor. The Congress did this successfully for 40 years while the state controlled the commanding heights of the economy and society. From the mid-80s, the push towards privatisation changed this equation, giving a significantly bigger role to mercantile castes and classes. By the 1990s, along with the Rao-Manmohan reforms, public culture was dominated by the valorisation of entrepreneurship; the state was increasingly seen as a hindrance to India's development. This change in the political attitude of India's elites is a crucial condition for the rise of the BJP from the late-80s onwards. By the mid-1990s, the BJP had established itself as the 'party of rule', or the party which attracted the majority of ruling elites around it. Between 1971 and 1996, the Congress was the single-largest party in six out of seven Lok Sabha elections. In the 25 years since then, the BJP has been the single-largest party in five out of seven Lok Sabha elections. In effect, the BJP replaced the Congress as the default destination for ruling elites, whether directly or through electoral alliances with regional parties. The 2004 and 2009 elections may appear to disprove this but both these elections are outliers in the trend. And the pressures of a non-dominant power being in power showed up very quickly in the struggle between the government and the party in the UPA years. The party leadership recognised that it does not have the abiding backing of the ruling elites, and wanted to ensure a bigger standing amongst the 'people'. The tie-up with the Left and the Common Minimum Programme made it even more suspect among corporates and mercantile groups. This is why the Congress tried to rebuild a base amongst the poor through MGNREGA and farm loan waivers. Yet, the government itself was run by people who were deeply pro-corporate and pro-market. They were needed for the Congress to be able to build bridges with the new ruling elites of India, especially the mercantile classes and castes. Many of these former ministers are now part of the rebel G-23 camp. Even old-school 'socialist' ministers moved 'right' as they contended with babus who rose during the years when India's economy was turning right. Very quickly, the Sonia-led party found it difficult to control the government. The first clear glimpse of this was during the Indo-US nuclear deal, which the Left parties opposed. Veterans of the Left beat will tell you how they were convinced that a compromise had been worked out between the Congress and the Left parties. Things suddenly fell apart when Manmohan Singh gave an interview to a leading newspaper, daring the Left to withdraw support. The party had to unleash its minders to soothe things, but that round went to the PM. Within a couple of years of the UPA's return to power in 2009 with a bigger mandate, the Gandhis found their authority severely pruned. Cabinet reshuffles in UPA-2 show that Gandhi family loyalists were slowly eased out of key posts, and those who remained gradually began to assert their independence. The most prominent amongst the alternate power centres were Pranab Mukherjee and P Chidambaram, but even junior ministers were happy to gossip against the Gandhis in private conversations with journalists. The agenda of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) was often at cross-purposes with the Congress party's electoral strategists. One battle that Sonia and her team lost was over the free ration to everyone. The party leadership wanted a big food subsidy to add to other vote-winning schemes like MGNREGA and farm loan waivers. The PMO blocked it by asking its own commission to study its feasibility. Even the flagship MGNREGA was gradually defunded by Finance Minister Chidambaram. This led to an open battle between Chidambaram and the then Rural Development minister Jairam Ramesh who was widely seen as a Rahul Gandhi man. There are numerous such instances in the public domain, along with anecdotes and stories that circulate on the journalistic grapevine, that indicate that there was significant tension between 10 Janpath and Raisina Hill. It was to explode in the public spectacle of Rahul Gandhi barging into a Congress press conference and tearing up an ordinance being pushed by PM Manmohan Singh. That was the Congress in power. The Congress out of power has continued with the same tensions. The most visible Congress leaders outside the Gandhi family are former ministers, and some of them are more technocrats than politicians. P Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal, Shashi Tharoor have all been key faces of the UPA, and are well-known to television audiences across the country. None of them are old-school party loyalists, and they have gone against the party's writ several times, even when it was in power. Right now, however, the G-23 is of no value to Rahul Gandhi. He realises that they cannot win him any elections because the ruling elites do not back them when they are out of power. That is why Rahul is trying to build a new alliance by promoting a second-rung of leaders who have emerged from outside the English-speaking elite and their cohorts. He is gradually positioning street-savvy young leaders who have a vernacular connect. We saw one such person emerge during the second wave of COVID: the 40-year old former cricketer from Shimoga, Srinivas BV, who became a household name by arranging emergency services for COVID patients. Rahul has made him head of the Youth Congress. Then there are Jignesh Mevani and Kanhaiya Kumar. Mevani, a Dalit activist and independent MLA from Gujarat, has often been criticised by other Dalit leaders for being too close to the Left. Kanhaiya Kumar, the poster boy of radical student politics, is the son of an Anganwadi worker. Even in 2019, there were rumours that he would get a Congress ticket from Bihar, but things didn't work out and Kanhaiya fought as a CPI candidate. He joins the Congress directly from being a national executive member of the CPI. Both these young firebrands have demonstrated that they have big political ambitions. Yet, their youth (Mevani is 40 and Kanhaiya 34) will allow them to think of the long term. They will not mind listening to Rahul, who is in his early 50s, or playing a supporting role in alliances with strong regional parties. They also represent a strand within India's poor who are sympathetic to backward caste and Dalit politics, but do not identify with caste parties. This strategic shift is a result of pure necessity. The Congress cannot compete with the BJP either in the space of getting support from the ruling elites or in building a political consensus based on a religious identity. Neither can it compete with regional parties controlled by key dominant castes - SP, BSP, RJD, JD(U) or JD(S). Rahul Gandhi's only hope is to build a ground level network of young activists and leaders who see class as the key driver of politics. This is what is pushing Rahul to the left, and increasing the distance between him and the G-23. The leaders who emerged in the 2000s are still stuck within the power networks, where the BJP rules supreme. They cannot escape it. For now, Rahul has no use for them. They will only become relevant again, if a large section of India Inc, who ultimately finance the game of fighting elections, lose faith in the Modi Government. It is then that the prominent faces of the G-23 will again be needed.   (Aunindyo Chakravarty was Senior Managing Editor of NDTV's Hindi and Business news channels.)

""Well then, you should get on it,"" came her reply. Ardem Patapoutian, meanwhile, had long been driven to unlock the neglected mysteries of touch, which govern everything from how we discriminate between objects and how we feel when we hug another person, to how our bodies intuitively ""know"" where our limbs are, without looking. Both American molecular biologists won the Nobel Medicine Prize for their groundbreaking advances, conducted independently of each other in the late 1990s and 2000s, that are now being turned towards developing treatments, especially of pain. Julius, of the University of California, San Francisco told reporters he had always been fascinated by how people interact with natural products in their environment, and by how certain plants contain chemical irritants, such as spice. Prior research had shown capsaicin was important as an activator of neurons involved in pain -- but the underlying mechanism was unclear. Julius discovered in 1997 the specific protein on the outer tip of sensory nerves responsible for the sensation of burning pain from chilies -- and discovered it also responded to high temperatures. He then turned to compounds from menthol and mint to identify similar ""receptors"" responsible for cold, and used molecules from wasabi to learn about inflammatory pain. ""I like doing experimental science because you get to work at the bench with your hands while you're also thinking, and that gives you an opportunity to really sort of enjoy what you're doing day to day, almost like a hobby,"" he said. ""There's a time when you make a discovery, where you're the only person on the planet, or at least you think you're the only person on the planet who knows the answer to a particular question, and that's a really thrilling moment."" A number of drug candidates to stop chronic pain are in the pipeline, but have so far come up against challenging side effects. ""You have to walk this line of wanting to inhibit pain that's chronic... but not eliminate pain sensation that's protective or acute,"" he said. Immigrant success Patapoutian, of Scripps Research, also made discoveries linked to temperature, but his investigations into pressure stood out even more. Specifically, he found two genes responsible for converting pressure into electrical signals through tests on lab-cultured cells. It was a painstaking progress arrived at by deleting one gene after another. ""After working on this for a whole year and getting one negative result after another, the 72nd candidate ... wiped out this ability,"" he said at a press event. Armenian-origin Patapoutian, who grew up in war-torn Lebanon and came to the US aged 18, said it was hard for him to imagine the day would come he would win a Nobel. When the Nobel committee tried calling him at 2:00 am in California, his phone was on silent.   ""They somehow got a hold of my 94-year-old father who lives in Los Angeles, and I guess even if you have 'Do not disturb' people in your favorites can call you,"" he said, adding it was a ""very special moment.""

""We will be working to ensure that Amplify Energy Corporation does everything possible to rectify this environmental catastrophe,"" Huntington Beach said. Amplify Energy said Monday that ""as a precautionary measure, all of the company's production and pipeline operations at the Beta Field have been shut down."" The company said it was sending a remotely operated vehicle to try to find the source of the leak. 'Just devastating' Officials have warned people not to touch or try to save any wildlife they find, but to instead call local authorities to alert them to animals affected by the oil. ""This is just devastating for our marine life, our habitat, our economics, our entire community,"" Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley said Sunday. ""Our natural habitat we've spent decades building up and creating is just damaged in a day."" The spill originated near the Elly platform, which was built in 1980 and is one of 23 oil and gas drilling platforms in federal waters off California, the Los Angeles Times reported. The disaster has already reignited a debate about the presence of oil rigs and pipelines near the coast of Southern California. ""The oil spill...is as tragic as it was preventable,"" said Alan Lowenthal, a Democrat who represents the area in the US Congress. ""This environmental catastrophe highlights the simple fact that where you drill, you spill. ""This will be devastating not only to our marine wildlife and ecosystem, but also to the livelihoods of our coastal communities which are built around fishing, tourism, and recreation. ""As long as these platforms and pipelines remain, our coastal communities remain under threat from potential disasters like we are now seeing."" Oil spills have scarred California for decades; pictures of dead, oil-covered dolphins and tar-stained beaches off Santa Barbara in 1969 spurred widespread revulsion. California has not granted any permits to drill for oil since then. But the state's jurisdiction extends only three miles offshore, and federally sanctioned oil and gas platforms dot the area's seascape, many of them easily visible from the shore. Environmentalists have repeatedly called attention to the age of some of the facilities, which they say are rusty and poorly maintained, and the risks they pose. The nature of the current oil spill has not been determined, but leaks were detected in 1999 on the pipeline linking two platforms in the Beta field, which was then jointly operated by Mobil and Shell, according to the Los Angeles Times.   ""This is why the US needs to end coastal oil drilling,"" the Times wrote in an editorial. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the incident on Sunday. The video, being shared widely on social media, is yet to be verified by the police. NDTV cannot independently verify its authenticity. It is also not clear from the visuals who is in the driving seat. Earlier today, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted the viral clip with a pointed question for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""@narendramodi Sir, your government has kept me in custody for the last 28 hours without any order and FIR. This person who crushed the annadata (farmers) has not been arrested yet. Why?"" tweeted Priyanka Gandhi this morning. In the 25-second video clip, the SUV rams protesters, who fall to the ground, while others scramble to get out of the way. Another vehicle, with sirens blaring, is seen tailing the SUV that hit the farmers. The video matches descriptions given to NDTV on Sunday by farmers at the spot, who said the car suddenly hit them from behind. The make and colour of the lead SUV that hits the farmers also matches other visuals from the site. The farmers have alleged that the protesters were run over by an SUV driven by Union Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra's son Ashish Mishra. Both the Minister and his son have denied even being at the spot. The incident took place when a group of protesting farmers in Tikonia area of Kheri tried to block Mr Mishra and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya from visiting. The protesters were upset over a recent speech by Mr Mishra. The farmers claimed the violence broke out after a car in the minister's convoy ran over protesters. Visuals from the area showed arson and vehicles set on fire. A murder case has been filed against the Union minister's son.   Minister Ajay Mishra says he is not aware about any FIR against his son. He has also denied that his son was linked to the violence. ""My son wasn't present at the spot. There were miscreants who attacked workers with sticks and swords. Had my son been there, he wouldn't have come out alive,"" Mr Mishra, the junior Home Minister, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. ""My son was present at the venue of the (Deputy Chief Minister's) event... all through, I was accompanying the deputy chief minister,"" he said. The government has promised to pay a compensation of ₹ 45 lakh to the families of those who died. The injured will receive a compensation of ₹ 10 lakh. A retired judge will investigate the matter, the state government has said."

https://t.co/eLloioGCr9 https://t.co/9HfsmmAa32",https://www.ndtv.com/blog/blog-rahul-gandhi-is-right-to-ignore-g-23-for-now-2563478,Blog: Why G-23 Cannot Dent The Gandhis For Now,"The battle between Rahul Gandhi and the G-23 is not just a turf war. It is a battle for personal political survival. We will not understand this if we only look it from the point of view of party politics. Realpolitik is much more than that. The political system consists of not just what is visible to us, but the entire system of power that helps parties win. The biggest role played here is of the various national and regional elites - big corporates, the babudom, judicial officers, media, public intellectuals, urban power-brokers, big landlords and even foreign companies, funds and institutions. It is only when a significant proportion of these disparate elites stand behind a political party that it can come to power. Of course, in democracies, political parties rule in the name of the people. And in India, the people are overwhelmingly poor. The rule of the elites thus has to be mediated through an electoral process that can mobilise the poor behind a programme that ultimately reproduces the system. So a successful political party needs to forge an invisible coaltion between the ruling elites and the voting poor. The Congress did this successfully for 40 years while the state controlled the commanding heights of the economy and society. From the mid-80s, the push towards privatisation changed this equation, giving a significantly bigger role to mercantile castes and classes. By the 1990s, along with the Rao-Manmohan reforms, public culture was dominated by the valorisation of entrepreneurship; the state was increasingly seen as a hindrance to India's development. This change in the political attitude of India's elites is a crucial condition for the rise of the BJP from the late-80s onwards. By the mid-1990s, the BJP had established itself as the 'party of rule', or the party which attracted the majority of ruling elites around it. Between 1971 and 1996, the Congress was the single-largest party in six out of seven Lok Sabha elections. In the 25 years since then, the BJP has been the single-largest party in five out of seven Lok Sabha elections. In effect, the BJP replaced the Congress as the default destination for ruling elites, whether directly or through electoral alliances with regional parties. The 2004 and 2009 elections may appear to disprove this but both these elections are outliers in the trend. And the pressures of a non-dominant power being in power showed up very quickly in the struggle between the government and the party in the UPA years. The party leadership recognised that it does not have the abiding backing of the ruling elites, and wanted to ensure a bigger standing amongst the 'people'. The tie-up with the Left and the Common Minimum Programme made it even more suspect among corporates and mercantile groups. This is why the Congress tried to rebuild a base amongst the poor through MGNREGA and farm loan waivers. Yet, the government itself was run by people who were deeply pro-corporate and pro-market. They were needed for the Congress to be able to build bridges with the new ruling elites of India, especially the mercantile classes and castes. Many of these former ministers are now part of the rebel G-23 camp. Even old-school 'socialist' ministers moved 'right' as they contended with babus who rose during the years when India's economy was turning right. Very quickly, the Sonia-led party found it difficult to control the government. The first clear glimpse of this was during the Indo-US nuclear deal, which the Left parties opposed. Veterans of the Left beat will tell you how they were convinced that a compromise had been worked out between the Congress and the Left parties. Things suddenly fell apart when Manmohan Singh gave an interview to a leading newspaper, daring the Left to withdraw support. The party had to unleash its minders to soothe things, but that round went to the PM. Within a couple of years of the UPA's return to power in 2009 with a bigger mandate, the Gandhis found their authority severely pruned. Cabinet reshuffles in UPA-2 show that Gandhi family loyalists were slowly eased out of key posts, and those who remained gradually began to assert their independence. The most prominent amongst the alternate power centres were Pranab Mukherjee and P Chidambaram, but even junior ministers were happy to gossip against the Gandhis in private conversations with journalists. The agenda of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) was often at cross-purposes with the Congress party's electoral strategists. One battle that Sonia and her team lost was over the free ration to everyone. The party leadership wanted a big food subsidy to add to other vote-winning schemes like MGNREGA and farm loan waivers. The PMO blocked it by asking its own commission to study its feasibility. Even the flagship MGNREGA was gradually defunded by Finance Minister Chidambaram. This led to an open battle between Chidambaram and the then Rural Development minister Jairam Ramesh who was widely seen as a Rahul Gandhi man. There are numerous such instances in the public domain, along with anecdotes and stories that circulate on the journalistic grapevine, that indicate that there was significant tension between 10 Janpath and Raisina Hill. It was to explode in the public spectacle of Rahul Gandhi barging into a Congress press conference and tearing up an ordinance being pushed by PM Manmohan Singh. That was the Congress in power. The Congress out of power has continued with the same tensions. The most visible Congress leaders outside the Gandhi family are former ministers, and some of them are more technocrats than politicians. P Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal, Shashi Tharoor have all been key faces of the UPA, and are well-known to television audiences across the country. None of them are old-school party loyalists, and they have gone against the party's writ several times, even when it was in power. Right now, however, the G-23 is of no value to Rahul Gandhi. He realises that they cannot win him any elections because the ruling elites do not back them when they are out of power. That is why Rahul is trying to build a new alliance by promoting a second-rung of leaders who have emerged from outside the English-speaking elite and their cohorts. He is gradually positioning street-savvy young leaders who have a vernacular connect. We saw one such person emerge during the second wave of COVID: the 40-year old former cricketer from Shimoga, Srinivas BV, who became a household name by arranging emergency services for COVID patients. Rahul has made him head of the Youth Congress. Then there are Jignesh Mevani and Kanhaiya Kumar. Mevani, a Dalit activist and independent MLA from Gujarat, has often been criticised by other Dalit leaders for being too close to the Left. Kanhaiya Kumar, the poster boy of radical student politics, is the son of an Anganwadi worker. Even in 2019, there were rumours that he would get a Congress ticket from Bihar, but things didn't work out and Kanhaiya fought as a CPI candidate. He joins the Congress directly from being a national executive member of the CPI. Both these young firebrands have demonstrated that they have big political ambitions. Yet, their youth (Mevani is 40 and Kanhaiya 34) will allow them to think of the long term. They will not mind listening to Rahul, who is in his early 50s, or playing a supporting role in alliances with strong regional parties. They also represent a strand within India's poor who are sympathetic to backward caste and Dalit politics, but do not identify with caste parties. This strategic shift is a result of pure necessity. The Congress cannot compete with the BJP either in the space of getting support from the ruling elites or in building a political consensus based on a religious identity. Neither can it compete with regional parties controlled by key dominant castes - SP, BSP, RJD, JD(U) or JD(S). Rahul Gandhi's only hope is to build a ground level network of young activists and leaders who see class as the key driver of politics. This is what is pushing Rahul to the left, and increasing the distance between him and the G-23. The leaders who emerged in the 2000s are still stuck within the power networks, where the BJP rules supreme. They cannot escape it. For now, Rahul has no use for them. They will only become relevant again, if a large section of India Inc, who ultimately finance the game of fighting elections, lose faith in the Modi Government. It is then that the prominent faces of the G-23 will again be needed.   (Aunindyo Chakravarty was Senior Managing Editor of NDTV's Hindi and Business news channels.)

Hardest hit were corals in South Asia and the Pacific, around the Arabian Peninsula, and off the coast of Australia, more than 300 scientists in the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network reported. ""Climate change is the biggest threat to the world's reefs,"" co-author Paul Hardisty, CEO of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said in a statement. Oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions, shielding land surfaces but generating huge, long-lasting marine heatwaves that are pushing many species of corals past their limits of tolerance. A single so-called bleaching event in 1998 caused by warming waters wiped out eight percent of all corals. Coral reefs cover only a tiny fraction -- 0.2 percent -- of the ocean floor, but they are home to at least a quarter of all marine animals and plants. Besides anchoring marine ecosystems, they also provide protein, jobs and protection from storms and shoreline erosion for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. The value of goods and services from coral reefs is about $2.7 trillion per year, including $36 billion in tourism, the report said. Loss of coral from 2009 to 2018 varied by region, ranging from five percent in East Asia to 95 percent in the eastern tropical Pacific. The 'Coral Triangle' ""Since 2009 we have lost more coral worldwide than all the living coral in Australia,"" noted UNEP executive director Inger Anderson. ""We can reverse the losses, but we have to act now."" The UN's climate science advisory panel, the IPCC, projects with ""high confidence"" that global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels will see 70 to 90 percent of all corals disappear. In a 2C world, less than one percent of global corals would survive. Earth's average surface temperature has already increased by 1.1C above that benchmark. The report, titled ""Status of Coral Reefs of the World: 2020"", found reasons for cautious optimism. ""Some reefs have shown a remarkable ability to bounce back, which offers some hope for the future recovery of degraded reefs,"" Hardisty said. East and Southeast Asia's ""Coral Triangle"" -- which contains nearly 30 percent of the world's coral reefs -- were hit less hard by warming waters over the last decade, and in some cases showed recovery. This resilience could be due to species unique to the region, potentially offering strategies for boosting coral growth elsewhere, the authors said. Based on nearly two million data points from 12,000 sites spanning 73 countries and 40 years, the report is the sixth such global survey and the first since 2008. To measure change over time, the researchers contrasted areas covered by healthy live hard coral with areas taken over by algae, a sign of coral distress.   The report was undertaken with support from UNEP and the International Coral Reef Initiative, a partnership of governments and research organisations focused on preserving corals reefs and related ecosystems.

The rise is affecting nearly a quarter of the world's population, said the report published in the ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."" In recent decades, hundreds of millions of people have moved from rural areas to cities where temperatures are generally higher because of surfaces such as asphalt which trap heat and a lack of vegetation. Scientists studied the maximum daily heat and humidity in more than 13,000 cities from 1983 to 2016. Using the so-called ""wet-bulb globe temperature"" scale, a measure that takes into account heat and humidity, they defined extreme heat as 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). The researchers then compared weather data with statistics on the cities' population over the same 33-year period. They calculated the number of days of extreme heat in a particular year by the population of the city that year to come up with a definition called person-days. The authors found that the number of person-days in which city dwellers were exposed went from 40 billion per year in 1983 to 119 billion in 2016. Cascade Tuholske at Columbia University's Earth Institute, a lead author of the study, said the rise ""increases morbidity and mortality."" ""It impacts people's ability to work, and results in lower economic output. It exacerbates pre-existing health conditions,"" he said in a statement. Population growth accounted for two-thirds of the exposure spike, with actual warming temperatures contributing a third, although proportions varied from city to city, they wrote. Bangladesh's capital Dhaka was the worst-affected city, seeing an increase of 575 million person-days of extreme heat over the study period. That was largely attributable to its population soaring from around four million in 1983 to around 22 million today. Other big cities to show similar trends were Shanghai, Guangzhou, Yangon, Dubai, Hanoi and Khartoum as well as various cities in Pakistan, India and the Arabian Peninsula. Major cities that saw around half of their exposure causing by a warming climate included Baghdad, Cairo, Kuwait City, Lagos, Kolkata and Mumbai. The authors said the patterns they found in Africa and South Asia, ""may crucially limit the urban poor's ability to realize the economic gains associated with urbanization."" They added that ""sufficient investment, humanitarian intervention, and government support"" would be needed to counteract the negative impact. In the United States, some forty major cities saw exposure grow ""rapidly,"" mainly in the Gulf Coast states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.   The study was carried out by researchers at New York's Columbia, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, the University of Arizona at Tuscon and the University of California, Santa Barbara.

""As we saw the revelations that came out in that interview, in our view, this is just the latest in a series of revelations about social media platforms that make clear that self-regulation is not working. That's long been the president's view and been the view of this administration,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference. Psaki was responding to questions about the revealing interview by Frances Haugen, a former product manager hired to help protect against election interference on Facebook, in this regard. ""They validate the significant concern that the president and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed about how social media giants operate and the power they've amassed,"" Psaki said. ""Reports in recent weeks, and I think obviously the whistleblower came forward last night in the report, about efforts to attract young users and negative effects on teenagers' mental health are certainly troubling. They're hardly isolated incidents. And so, our effort is going to be: continue to support fundamental reforms, efforts to address these issues,"" Psaki said. ""Obviously, that would be up to the purview of Congress, but certainly, we view these as continuing in a series of revelations about the power of these platforms,"" said the White House press secretary. Meanwhile, Senator Edward Markey, a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, wrote to Facebook demanding answers after new research revealed that the company failed to meet commitments it made regarding the promotion of harmful advertisements to teen Facebook users. ""These findings cast serious doubt on Facebook's compliance with promises your employees have publicly made, and they are particularly concerning in light of other recent reports, which suggest that Facebook has direct knowledge that its platforms are harmful to young people,"" Markey wrote in his letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.   ""I request a detailed explanation of the apparent inconsistency between Facebook's commitments and your platform's practices, as well as a detailed review of the steps you are currently taking and plan to take to stop Facebook from allowing teen users to be targeted with inappropriate and dangerous content,"" he said. According to research conducted by the Campaign for Accountability's Tech Transparency Project, as recently as September 2021, Facebook allowed advertisers to target teen users as young as 13-years-old with inappropriate and dangerous content, including advertisements promoting ""pill abuse, alcoholic beverages, anorexia, smoking, dating services, and gambling."""

Through its propaganda arm Amaq, the jihadist group said Sunday's attack that killed at least five people was carried out by an IS suicide bomber. Before the claim, the Taliban's chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP initial information suggested IS-linked groups were responsible. After overrunning Kabul seven weeks ago the hardline Islamist Taliban have set up an interim Afghan government, but still face attacks from the IS regional branch. Mujahid said Taliban fighters carried out an operation targeting an IS cell in the north of Kabul on Sunday evening. The ""IS centre was completely destroyed and all the IS members in it were killed,"" Mujahid said on Twitter. Witnesses and AFP journalists heard blasts and gunfire in the capital at the time of the raid, and images posted to social media showed a large explosion and a fire at the scene. Kabul resident and government employee Abdul Rahaman told AFP that a ""large number"" of Taliban special forces attacked at least three houses in his neighbourhood. ""The fighting continued for several hours,"" he said, adding the sound of weapons kept him awake all night. ""They said they were after Daesh (IS) fighters in the area,"" Rahman said. ""I don't know how many were killed or arrested but the fighting was intense."" At the scene on Monday, AFP saw several Taliban gunmen standing guard, denying people access down the road to the property. Police pick-up trucks could be seen driving towards the site, one of which came back laden with household items including furniture, a carpet and kitchen appliances. The operation took place within hours of Sunday's blast, which targeted a prayer ceremony at the Eid Gah mosque in memory of Taliban spokesman Mujahid's mother, who died last week. A government cultural commission official, who asked not to be named, told AFP five people died and 11 were wounded, adding the casualties included both civilians and Taliban members. ""We have also arrested three people in connection with the blast,"" he said. Blood trails According to the official, the device was placed at the entrance to the mosque and detonated as mourners were leaving after offering condolences to Mujahid and his family. A witness at the mosque, who asked not to be identified, told AFP Sunday's attack at the entrance was carried out by a single suicide bomber. Just outside the eastern gate, a dark patch was visible on the ground where the explosion took place and bullet holes could be seen in a wall. The witness said a group of Taliban members -- including senior figures -- inside the mosque grounds came under fire after the blast, taking two casualties. He added that two Taliban units mistakenly opened fire on each other in the confusion following the explosion, but interior ministry spokesman Qari Sayed Khosti denied there had been any gunfire. ""A suicide bomber detonated his explosives among the crowd killing three people and wounding a dozen,"" he said. Trails of blood into the mosque, as well as two red pools where the witness said the injured fighters were treated inside, were seen by AFP reporters on Monday. The Taliban and the Afghanistan branch of IS -- known as the Islamic State-Khorasan Province, or IS-K -- are both hardline Sunni Islamist militant groups. But they differ on the issues of religion and strategy, which has led to bloody fighting between the two.   The United Nations in Afghanistan condemned Sunday's mosque attack.

While previous data from clinical trials has shown jabs protect against hospitalisation, the study published in the Lancet measures one vaccine's effectiveness over time in a real-world setting. Pfizer and healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente looked at records from 3.4 million residents of southern California, about a third of whom were fully vaccinated between December 2020 and August 2021. After an average period of three to four months, fully vaccinated people were found to be 73 percent protected against infection and 90 percent protected against hospitalisation. But while protection against infection from Delta fell by 40 percent over five months, protection against hospitalisation involving cases from all variants remained very high for the duration of the study. The results, the study notes, are consistent with preliminary data from US and Israeli health authorities. Reduced infection defence is ""likely to be primarily due to waning vaccine effectiveness rather than the delta variant escaping vaccine protection"", the authors conclude. ""Our findings underscore the importance of monitoring vaccine effectiveness over time and suggest that booster doses are likely to be needed to restore the initial high amounts of protection observed early in the vaccination programme,"" it says. In August the US authorised an extra dose of Covid-19 vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, while in France an extra shot has been offered to the elderly. Israel has gone further, offering children 12 and older a third dose five months after receiving a second jab. A September report, however, from the World Health Organization (WHO) found current vaccines are effective enough against severe Covid to make a third jab unnecessary for the general population.   The WHO last month called for a moratorium on booster jabs until the end of the year to address the drastic inequity in dose distribution between rich and poor nations.

Mr Kumar, along with others had allegedly assaulted former junior national wrestling champion Sagar Dhankar and his friends at the stadium in May over an alleged property dispute. Dhankar later succumbed to the injuries. Additional Sessions Judge Shivaji Anand will hear the bail plea on Tuesday. Advocate Nitin Vasishth, appearing for the victim and complainant Sonu, said that Mr Kumar should not be released on bail as more accused are yet to be arrested and they, along with Mr Kumar, may influence the witnesses. The international wrestler who is jail since June 2, 2021, sought relief from the court by asserting that he has been falsely implicated in the alleged murder case and the accusations are levelled with the aim and object of humiliating him and injuring his reputation. In the plea, he said that the ""unfortunate demise"" of a budding wrestler was sensationalized and the same was exploited against him by parties with a vested interest. The Olympian emphasized that the police left no stone unturned to present a ""false and guilty image"" of him and fed false information to the media to wrongfully establish a connection between him and renowned gangsters. ""They had even gone to the point of painting a grotesque image of the present accused where he was said to be a gangster himself and even questions were raised against his antecedents,"" Mr Kumar said in a 16-pages bail plea. However, after filing the charge sheet, all the claims and leaks made by the investigating agency are untrue and without any footing in the reality, the plea filed through advocate Pradeep Rana said. To buttress his contentions, he stated that the FIR was filed after a delay, and statements of witnesses were marred by improvements and contractions, and were deliberately withheld by the investigating agency to build a ""false case"". ""The investigating agency at the fag end of the investigation cropped up a new version that the deceased had given a dying declaration to the police officials with an aim to add bite to the otherwise toothless case of the prosecution,"" Mr Kumar submitted. He also called the FIR a conjoint mix of ""assumption, presumption, and malafide intentions"", adding that the police arrested him in the absence of concrete evidence. The wrestler further said that he is no more required for any custodial interrogation, much less for any recovery or discovery of incriminating material as the charge sheet has been filed which shows that the probe against him is over. Mr Kumar said that nothing incriminating has been recovered from him which further corroborates his innocence but the investigating agency in order to build a case against him has attributed certain vehicles and weapons to him. The wrestler further told the court that he has clean antecedents and has never violated any law. ""The accused has received various laurels representing India and has made the nation proud by winning medals at numerous International tournaments and championships,"" the plea stated and listed out all the medals he has won over the years. The Olympic wrestler submitted that he is confident to prove his innocence before any court of law and any detention at this stage would only be pre-trial incarceration without any fault on his part being innocent. The police had earlier said that the brawl at the stadium was the result of a conspiracy hatched by Mr Kumar, who wanted to re-establish his supremacy among younger wrestlers.   Mr Kumar, along with 12 other accused, has been named in the charge sheet filed by the Delhi Police in August. The Delhi Police had filed an FIR against the accused of offences such as murder, attempt to murder, culpable homicide, criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, robbery, rioting, among others."

While Bahraich natives, led by various organisations, lodged their protest by submitting a memorandum, addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind, to the district administration, the Samajwadi Party workers burnt effigies of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and held ""satyagraha"" at many places. In their memorandum addressed to President Kovind, locals expressed grief and demanded stern action against those responsible for the incident. The proposed Monday's visit of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to Bahraich and Shravasti too was cancelled in the wake of Sunday's violence in Lakhimpur Kheri. Meanwhile, the families of the two dead Bahraich residents awaited the bodies of their family and hoped that they would reach their ancestral villages by Monday evening. Bahraich's Additional Superintendent of Police (Rural) Ashok Kumar said, ""A deputy superintendent of police and an inspector have gone to Lakhimpur Kheri to bring the bodies of the dead farmers."" After the post-mortem examination of the dead bodies in Lakhimpur, the last rites will be held here on arrival. The dead bodies had not reached till sunset so the last rites would be held on Tuesday morning, the ASP said. Among the dead, Gurvinder Singh was unmarried and a granthi of the local gurdwara, so people used to call him ""Gyani ji"". He often used to go to the gurdwara at Tikunia in Lakhimpur, his family said, adding he was a very simple man and used to stay away from any kind of quarrels and disputes. The second farmer, Daljit Singh was a resident of Banjaran Tanda village of Nanpara Kotwali area. Administrative sources said Daljit Singh has a 20-year-old unmarried daughter and two sons. His eldest son is a high school student. Villagers said that Daljit was crushed to death by a jeep in front of his 15-year-old son. With the news of their death, an eerie silence has descended upon both villages with the relatives of the dead and villagers mourning their death and demanding strict action against the guilty.   After the Sunday violence in Lakhimpur Kheri, the train service between Bahraich and Lakhimpur Mailani has been suspended as a precautionary measure and the roads leading to Lakhimpur and Sitapur too have been sealed by the police.

The 53, 245 deaths recorded worldwide between September 27 and October 3, an average of 7,606 each day, showed that the global pandemic continues the downward trend that began at the end of August, after a peak of around 10,000 deaths per day. The new weekly deaths figure is the lowest recorded since October 31-November 6, 2020. Over the last month the number of Covid-19 related deaths has fallen by almost a quarter, as vaccination campaigns make progress. After a year of Coronavirus waves, linked in particular to the spread of variants including the more contagious Delta strain, the curve of new cases is also down, by almost a third compared to the end of August. With nearly 81 doses of anti-Covid-19 vaccine administered per 100 inhabitants worldwide, according to an AFP count, the authorities hope to see this decline continue, even if there are still major disparities between regions. For every 100 residents of North America 123 vaccines doses have been administered. The figure for Africa is 11 doses per 100 people, with half the nations on the continent managing to fully vaccinate just two percent of their people, according to the World Health Organization's Africa office. Since the virus was first discovered in China in late 2019, around 4.8 million people have died of Covid-19 around the world.

The initiative comes after an 18-year-old student at Perm State University last month shot dead six people in the latest in a growing number of campus shootings in recent years. Russia's youth affairs agency Rosmolodyozh said an NGO founded in 2018 at the behest of President Vladimir Putin has developed software that can ""quickly track the spread of destructive subcultures among young people"". ""The system is used to monitor the open circuit of the Russian-speaking segment of popular social networks,"" Rosmolodyozh told AFP in a statement. Rosmolodyozh added that the Centre for the Study and Network Monitoring of the Youth Environment had also developed a separate system called ""Angel.Destruktiv"" to monitor telecommunications networks and the internet. The programme alerts authorities to information that leads ""children and young people to take actions that pose a threat to their life"", it said, as well as ""signs of fatally negative deviant states"". Rosmolodyozh said that the NGO already provides law enforcement agencies with information ""about intent to commit illegal or antisocial actions"". Russian business dailies RBK and Vedomosti reported last month that the government had allocated more than 1.5 billion rubles ($20 million, $17 million euros) for the development of a similar system. Sarkis Darbinyan, a lawyer with the Roskomsvoboda digital rights NGO, said that the software would automatise ""the repression of online activity,"" calling it a ""very serious threat to freedom of speech"". ""It is very doubtful that the ultimate goal will be achieved, but this system can lead to problems for many users and activists."" It carries ""huge risks to the freedom of people who express opinions against the government,"" he added. The Russian government has in recent years used the pretext of protecting minors and fighting extremism to control the Russian segment of the web and has begun developing a so-called sovereign internet.   Authorities have blamed foreign influence for school shootings, saying young Russians have been exposed online and on television to similar attacks in the United States and elsewhere.

Tiwary was caught in the eye of the storm after a case was registered on August 16 by the survivor who belongs to a Scheduled Tribe. The underage girl in the FIR accused Tiwary of sexual exploitation and the case was registered for violation of offences under the Indian Penal Code and the SC/ST Act. Tiwary had earlier pleaded for anticipatory bail before the Ranchi district court but it was rejected. He had then applied for anticipatory bail before the High Court of Jharkhand but was subsequently arrested on September 12. Tiwary's wife Lalima Tiwary had filed a criminal writ petition in the high court seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the matter. She alleged that her husband has been framed due to political vendetta. The High Court on Thursday had issued notices to the state chief secretary and the Director General of Police after Tiwary's wife filed the petition seeking a CBI probe into the matter. The bench of Justice SK Dwivedi also issued a notice to the senior superintendent of police of Ranchi in connection with the case.   Tiwary, a close associate of BJP Legislature Party leader Marandi, was accused of raping his domestic help last year. In her petition, Lalima Tiwary had claimed that ever since her husband had made statements in the Rupa Tirkey case, he has been targeted by the ruling dispensation.

The MLAs reached Delhi in batches in the past few days amid speculations about a leadership change in the state. According to sources, over 30 MLAs returned to Raipur in a special flight on Monday evening and the remaining few will leave the national capital soon. The MLAs had said that they wanted to meet All India Congress Committee (AICC) in charge of Chhattisgarh PL Punia and convey that Rahul Gandhi should extend the duration of his proposed tour to the state, so that all MLAs can benefit from it. However, many were viewing their Delhi visit as a show of strength in support of Mr Baghel amid speculations over the possibility of a leadership change in Chhattisgarh where cabinet minister TS Singh Deo is vying for the chief minister's post. MLA Brihaspat Singh, who is known to be close to Mr Baghel, told PTI, ""We spoke to Punia ji over phone on Sunday night and he mentioned the incident of Lakhimpur Kheri and said that now the meeting may be delayed. He will meet us when he next visits Raipur."" Eight people were killed -- four farmers allegedly run over and four people in a convoy of BJP workers who were lynched -- on Sunday as violence erupted during a farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri district in Uttar Pradesh. Mr Singh once again reiterated that there is no question of a change of leadership in the state and the government will complete its term of five years under the leadership of Mr Baghel. The demand for a change of guard reared its head in Chhattisgarh after Mr Baghel completed two-and-a-half years as chief minister in June 2021. The camp of cabinet minister Mr Singh Deo has claimed that the high command in 2018 had agreed to hand over the post to him after the government completed half its term. The Congress high command summoned both Mr Baghel and Mr Singh Deo to Delhi in August to resolve the feud. It appeared that Mr Baghel had managed to avert, for the time being, a leadership change when he told reporters in Raipur recently that Rahul Gandhi had agreed to visit the state ""on his invitation"", and those talking about rotating the chief minister's post were promoting political instability.   However, there has been constant speculation over the matter. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists obtained 11.9 million confidential documents from 14 separate legal and financial services firms, which the group said offered ""a sweeping look at an industry that helps the world's ultrawealthy, powerful government officials and other elites conceal trillions of dollars from tax authorities, prosecutors and others."" Moving money through offshore accounts, in mostly low-tax jurisdictions, is legal in most countries, and many of the people named in the data release aren't accused of criminal wrongdoing. But the journalist group said the 2.94 terabytes of financial and legal data -- which makes this leak larger than the 2016 Panama papers release -- shows the ""offshore money machine operates in every corner of the planet, including the world's largest democracies,"" and involves some of the world's most well-known banks and legal firms. Here are some of the biggest revelations in the release: Jordan king's real estate empire Jordan's monarch, King Abdullah II, used an English accountant in Switzerland and lawyers in the British Virgin Islands to secretly purchase 14 luxury homes worth $106 million, including a $23 million property in California overlooking a beach, the ICIJ reported, noting the country relies on foreign aid to support its people and house millions of refugees. U.K. attorneys for the king told the ICIJ that he was not required to pay taxes under Jordanian law, has never misused public funds and has ""security and privacy reasons to hold property through offshore companies."" French Riviera estate Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who is currently running for re-election, ""moved $22 million through offshore companies to buy a lavish estate on the French Riviera in 2009 while keeping his ownership secret,"" ICIJ said. The five-bedroom Chateau Bigaud, which is owned by a subsidiary of one of Babis's Czech companies, sits on 9.4 acres (3.8 hectares) in a hilltop village where Pablo Picasso spent the last years of his life, the group said. The Queen and Azerbaijan The data release revealed that Azerbaijan's ruling Aliyev family traded around $540 million worth of U.K. property in recent years, reportedthe Guardian, one of the ICIJ's media partners. Queen Elizabeth II's crown estate bought one property worth almost $91 million from the family, and is currently in the middle of an internal review into the purchase, the Guardian said. ""Given the potential concerns raised, we are looking into the matter,"" a spokesperson for the crown estate told the paper, which added the Aliyevs declined to comment. South Dakota, Nevada havens One of the most ""troubling revelations"" for the U.S. was the role of South Dakota, Nevada and other states that have adopted financial secrecy laws that ""rival those of offshore jurisdictions"" and demonstrate America's ""expanding complicity in the offshore economy,"" said the Washington Post, one of the ICIJ's media partners. A former vice president of the Dominican Republic finalized several trusts in South Dakota to store his personal wealth and shares of one of the country's largest sugar producers, the paper said. Pakistan's political elite Several members of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan's inner circle, including current and former cabinet ministers, ""secretly owned an array of companies and trusts holding millions of dollars of hidden wealth,"" the group reported. That could create a political headache for the former cricket star, who campaigned for the South Asian country's highest office as the head of a reformist party that promised a strong anti-corruption agenda. Before the release of the Pandora papers, a Khan spokesperson told a news conference Khan had no offshore company, but ministers and advisers ""will have to be held accountable"" for their individual acts.   Tony Blair property purchase The documents show former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife saved around $422,000 by using an offshore company to purchase an almost $9 million office in London's Marylebone area that was partially owned by the family of a Bahraini minister, the Guardian reported. The paper said there was nothing illegal about the deal, but it ""highlights a loophole that has enabled wealthy property owners not to pay a tax that is commonplace for ordinary Britons."""

The global health agency Unitaid and its partners hope to reach an agreement as soon as next week to secure the first supplies of the antiviral treatment for lower- and middle-income nations, Philippe Duneton, its executive director, said in an interview. Unitaid has been in discussions with the company and generic manufacturers, he said. ""This is really what we've waited for all these months,"" he said. ""There is a window of hope with this treatment, and now we need to collectively make it work for people"" in less well-to-do countries. If the new medication hits the market, it could be a turning point in the pandemic, but the global supply picture is uncertain. On the vaccine front, lower-income nations have been left behind. About nine months after the arrival of Covid shots, more than 55 countries have yet to vaccinate 10% of their populations. More than two dozen nations are below 2%. The drug, known as molnupiravir, reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 50% in an interim analysis of a late-stage clinical trial, Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP said Friday. Seeking Clearance The results were so positive that Merck and Ridgeback -- in consultation with independent trial monitors and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration -- elected to stop enrolling patients and begin the process of gaining regulatory clearance. Merck plans to submit the data to other regulators worldwide. The company earlier this year announced that it had signed non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for the drug with five generic manufacturers in India in a bid to accelerate availability in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies. Merck said it expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by year-end, with more expected in 2022. In June, the company agreed to a $1.2 billion supply deal with the U.S. government, under which it would provide 1.7 million courses of the treatment. Initial production wouldn't go far given the number of worldwide Covid cases. But the drug potentially could be very cheap to manufacture, so it should be available at a low cost in developing nations, Andrew Hill, a senior research fellow at the University of Liverpool, wrote in an email. ""This could be a major advance in the treatment of Covid-19,"" he said. Tiered Pricing Merck said it plans to implement a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank income criteria to reflect countries' ability to finance their health response to the pandemic.   The drug could provide an important tool for the world on top of vaccines, but manufacturing will need to be expanded and more funding is required, according to Unitaid's Duneton said. ""What we need to do is to create an affordable but quality market of generics, exactly what we did for combating AIDS,"" he said. ""It's feasible, it can be done."""

""If you can arrest us, why not the murder-accused minister's son,"" the Congress leader told NDTV in an exclusive interview from a government guest house in Sitapur where she was detained. She called it a ""complete collapse of the democratic, legal process"" in Uttar Pradesh, where the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government is in power. The violence erupted during protests against the visit of Union Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra and UP Deputy Chief Minister Swami Prasad Maurya to Lakhimpur Kheri for an event. Protesters gathered to stop the ministers as they were upset with a past comment of Mr Mishra on the farmer protests. The farmers allege that the Union Minister's son Ashish ran over the protesters, killing them. The UP police have named Ashish Mishra in an FIR, but the minister insists that neither he nor his son were at the spot. Several opposition leaders were stopped from travelling to Lakhimpur Kheri as the deaths became a political flashpoint in poll-bound UP. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said she was stopped around 4 am, when she was on the outskirts of Lakhimpur Kheri, around 130 KM from Lucknow. She said she was told she was arrested under Section 151 on grounds that she was ""going to commit a crime in future"". ""They did not show me any papers. If they do not give me any papers, I can call it kidnapping...If they don't charge me in 24 hours under Section 151, I can walk free. I don't have access to lawyers though I am told I have the right,"" Priyanka Gandhi said. According to her, the police first told them they were violating Section 144 (ban on large gatherings). ""When we told them we are not even four people, they said Section 151. Policemen and women pushed and shoved me. I was manhandled. How am I going to cause a riot like this? An accused minister's son is not arrested but they are stopping political leaders? The minister has not resigned, his son has not been arrested... I was simply going to somebody's house!""   Asked whether she was speaking from, she said ""I am currently in Sitapur, I guess, but I am not sure. When I left the house (Lucknow), police officers didn't allow my car to move and then I left my car and decided to walk. We got in somebody's car. They tried to stop us at several toll roads, then they lost us. We drove through some villages. They finally found us and stopped us at the point between Sitapur and Lakhimpur."" On the BJP accusing her and the Congress of ""playing politics"" over the violence, she snapped: ""Every time we are say something, we are accused of playing politics. When the BJP does it then they are being nationalists. What kind of nationalists are these? That they make laws that are completely destroy the farmers? Which nationalist does this to farmers?"""

""I was a part of the Bhatta Parsaul movement and had taken part in the foot-march. The then BSP government had targeted farmers, totally disregarding their self-respect. Today, the same situation is prevailing. After Bhatta Parsaul, there was a change of government in Uttar Pradesh and there will be a change of government in the state now,"" Mr Hooda, who was detained along with Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Sitapur while on their way to Lakhimpur Kheri, told news agency PTI over the phone. In 2011, two policemen and two farmers were killed in clashes following protests over the acquisition of land in Greater Noida's Bhatta Parsaul, a Jat-dominated village that had become the epicentre of agitation against land acquisition in the country. Back then, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had visited Bhatta Parsaul disguised and riding pillion on a two-wheeler being driven by his senior party colleague Digvijaya Singh in solidarity with the farmers protesting against the land acquisition taking place under the then Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh. In the next elections, Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party came to power. Mr Hooda, one of the four Congress leaders who were detained in Sitapur while they were on their way to Lakhimpur to meet the family members of the killed farmers on Sunday night, also told NDTV that he and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were taken in police custody together around 3:30 am. ""Since last night we have not been allowed to meet anyone. Neither has anyone been allowed to enter the premises. The police line in district Sitapur has been transformed virtually into a police 'chhawni'. The four of us were just seeking permission to go and meet the grieving families. We did not even bring a large number of supporters or anything,"" he said. ""For no reason, there was a lot of 'dhakka mukki', pushing around which is quite shocking to me also. I have been in public life for many, many years. And then for unexplained reasons, they took us into police custody,"" the Congress leader said. Sharpening his attack on the BJP, he accused it of being arrogant and showing scant regard to the farmers'' demands. ""The BJP has ignored the demands of the farmers and has occupied the throne of arrogance from where the 'pagdhi' of the farmers is not visible,"" Mr Hooda told PTI. ""The incident has embarrassed humanity. The minister has not resigned yet nor has he been removed. He must resign on moral grounds,"" he said, referring to Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra, whose son has been named in an FIR filed at the Tikonia police station in connection with Sunday's incident.   Eight people were killed as violence erupted during a farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday, claiming the lives of both farmers and BJP workers ahead of a visit by Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and minister Ajay Mishra. Of the eight dead, four were travelling in cars, apparently a part of a convoy of BJP workers who had come to welcome the ministers. They were allegedly thrashed to death.

We grant the university liberty to take action against the petitioner in case the petitioner gives any occasion,"" it said in the order. Taking note of the fact that the student was rusticated and classes were not also held for some time, the bench said the requirement of attendance will not come in his way of taking up the examination. Ahamad Khan was rusticated for his alleged involvement in organising protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019.   Mr Ahmadi submitted that the Lucknow-based university has stated that Ahamad Khan had tendered profound apologies addressed to the Vice-Chancellor on September 21, 2021, and consequently, a committee was set up to consider the student's case. The Committee unanimously resolved that Ahamad Khan be allowed to appear in the examination which is likely to be held in May 2022 or at a later date, the university said in the affidavit."

The Pradhan Mantri Swamitva Yojna is a scheme towards establishment of clear ownership of property in rural areas by mapping of land parcels using drone technology and providing ‘record of rights' to eligible households by issuing legal ownership cards to them. Harda is the first district in the country where the scheme was originally launched in 2008 under the name ""Mukhya Mantri Gramin Awas Adhikar Pustika"" by Mr Patel, who was then MP's revenue minister. Currently, Mr Patel is Madhya Pradesh's agriculture minister. Later, the scheme was implemented at the national level under the name Pradhan Mantri Swamitva Yojna with the help of Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, which granted land ownership rights to villagers so that they can mortgage their property for availing loans and also as a surety for securing bails, Mr Patel told PTI. Rural inhabitants were deprived of this right since independence, while their urban counterparts could take loans on the basis of their properties for starting a business or constructing their own house, he said. The scheme granted actual independence to villagers from their financial issues after over 70 years, the BJP minister said. PM Modi will also interact with the beneficiaries of the scheme on the occasion, he said. Besides, the Prime Minister will provide land rights to 1,71,000 residents from 3,000 villages at the event, Mr Patel said.   The scheme covers multifarious aspects like facilitating monetisation of properties and enabling bank loan, reducing property-related disputes and comprehensive village-level planning. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will also address the programme, he added."

Mr Channi, meanwhile, urged PM Narendra Modi to impress upon the UP government for taking firm steps in ensuring justice to the victim families of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and also reiterated the need to repeal the Centre's three contentious farm laws. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana held demonstrations at many places against the incident and took out protest marches, demanding the arrest of the son of Union minister Ajay Mishra. The protesters also burnt effigies of the BJP governments at the Centre and UP. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, along with several party MLAs, held a protest outside Punjab Raj Bhavan here against the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. The Aam Aadmi Party and the Shiromani Akali Dal also said they will be sending delegations to UP. The Punjab Chief Minister was denied permission, citing imposition of Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which prohibits the assembly of four or more people. The UP authorities informed the Punjab Civil Aviation Director that it was not feasible to grant permission to the chief minister and his deputy keeping in view the law and order situation, an official said. The Punjab Civil Aviation Director had sought permission for the landing of the Chief Minister's chopper at Lakhimpur Kheri, a spokesperson said. Mr Channi had planned to visit Lakhimpur Kheri to meet families of the farmers killed in violence during a protest over Uttar Pradesh Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya's visit there on Sunday. Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Randhawa and a few Congress MLAs were stopped at the Haryana-Uttar Pradesh border. A convoy of Mr Randhawa was stopped, after which he and the party MLAs sat on the road in protest.
After removing them from the road, the UP Police ""detained"" them. They were taken to the police post, Shahjhapur, in Saharanpur, said a Punjab government statement. Reacting to the detention of Mr Randhawa and MLAs, Mr Channi asked why Congress leaders are not being allowed to enter UP. ""Our Deputy CM @Sukhjinder_INC & MLAs have been detained at the UP Haryana Border. I condemn such tyranny being done by the UP Govt (sic),"" Mr Channi tweeted. Mr Randhawa, who also holds the home affairs portfolio, was accompanied by Punjab Congress working president Kuljit Nagra, MLAs Kulbir Zira, Angad Saini, Parminder Singh Pinki, Kuldeep Vaid and Barindermeet Singh Pahra. He criticised the UP government for not allowing them to go to Lakhimpur Kheri. The deputy CM dubbed the incident as a ""massacre"" of farmers and likened it to the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh tragedy. Earlier in the day, the Uttar Pradesh government requested the Lucknow airport authorities not to allow the arrival of the Punjab deputy chief minister in view of the violence. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson Raghav Chadha said a delegation of his party is going to Lakhimpur Kheri in protest against the incident. The delegation comprises Chadha, Harpal Singh Cheema, MLA Baljinder Kaur and the party's farmer wing president Kultar Singh Sandhwan. The party's Punjab unit chief and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann said, ""Whatever has happened at Lakhimpur Kheri is the limit of oppression."" Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said a delegation of his party, led by senior leader Prem Singh Chandumajra, had left for Lakhimpur Kheri to meet families of farmers and will seek a free and fair probe into the ""barbaric attack"". He also said his party will hold an emergency meeting of its core committee on Tuesday to finalise its next course of action after hearing the report of the party delegation. Eight people were killed on Sunday as violence erupted during a farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri, claiming the lives of both farmers and BJP workers ahead of a visit by UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya.   Four of the dead were people in the cars, apparently a part of a convoy of BJP workers who had come to welcome the UP minister.

Almost three hundred people including dozens of foreign nationals were killed in the April 21 attacks on three churches and three luxury hotels, in a wave of killings targeting Sri Lanka's Christian community. Prosecutors have brought over 20,000 charges against the suspects, three of whom have already been accused of terrorism by the US Justice Department. The suspects are in police custody, but one of them did not appear in court Monday as he was suffering from Covid-19, officials said, adding that hearings will begin on November 23. Prosecutors told the court that US and Australian forensic experts assisted investigators in tracking down the backers of the eight-member suicide squad responsible for the attacks. Sri Lanka authorities have accused their ringleader, Mohamed Naufar, of being the mastermind of the deadly suicide bombings and of being a member of the ISIS group. Former police chief Pujith Jayasundara and top defence official Hemasiri Fernando are also being prosecuted separately for failing to act on repeated intelligence warnings of a possible ISIS attack. An inquiry set up by former president Maithripala Sirisena found that he too was responsible for failing to prevent the attack and should be prosecuted.   The head of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, has repeatedly said he is unhappy with the lack of progress in the inquiry into the Easter bombings.

The soft-spoken 64-year-old from a Hiroshima political family made his first speech as premier hours after unveiling his cabinet, a mix of holdovers and newcomers. ""I'm determined to fulfil my duty with all my strength and all my heart,"" he said, calling measures to counter Covid-19 ""top priority"". ""I will swiftly take economic measures to support those who have been considerably affected by the new coronavirus."" He announced a general election on October 31, slightly earlier than expected, in which the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition party are widely expected to retain power. However, they could be vulnerable to losing some seats, with the public unhappy about the government's virus response. Having beaten popular vaccine chief Taro Kono last week to claim LDP leadership, Kishida easily won Monday's vote in parliament to confirm him as prime minister thanks to the party's commanding majority. The new leader said he wanted to distribute the benefits of growth more evenly in society. ""I aim to create a new capitalism... in order for our country to open the way to the future,"" he said. He also pledged to further digitalise society, partly through investment in green tech and AI, adding that he intends to attend the upcoming G20 and COP26 summits online. New cabinet Kishida is widely considered a safe pair of hands, who commands support from his own faction within the LDP and is not expected to veer significantly from the government's existing policies. His election came after former prime minister Yoshihide Suga announced he would not stand for the LDP leadership after just one year in office. Kishida's new cabinet includes more than a dozen fresh faces but holdovers from the Suga government largely populate the most important positions. Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, who has taken the lead in negotiating key trade deals, and Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi -- brother of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- both retained their jobs. The finance portfolio will go to Shunichi Suzuki, who is replacing his own brother-in-law Taro Aso. The cabinet includes three women, among them Kishida's one-time rival for the leadership, Seiko Noda, who was named minister in charge of addressing Japan's declining birthrate. ""The Kishida cabinet aims at balance with consideration given to major factions, young lawmakers, and neighbouring countries,"" said Junichi Makino, SMBC Nikko Securities chief economist. ""It's the kind of cabinet formation that reflects Kishida, who works not to make enemies."" Election looms US President Joe Biden offered his congratulations to Kishida, saying the ""historic partnership"" between the two nations will continue. As prime minister, Kishida faces a raft of challenges, from the post-pandemic economic recovery to confronting military threats from North Korea and from China, Japan's biggest trading partner. ""We need to continue our dialogue (with China). On the other hand, cooperating with our allies and friends, we are going to say firmly what we have to say. That's an important stance,"" he said. And raising the emotional issue of Japanese people who Tokyo believes were abducted by North Korea, Kishida said he was willing to meet the reclusive country's leader Kim Jong Un to discuss the issue ""without conditions"". Suga's government saw its approval ratings slump as it struggled to tackle waves of infection, including a record virus spike over the summer while the Olympics were being held in Tokyo. Much of Japan has been under virus emergency measures for a large part of the year, with the restrictions finally lifting last week as new infections decline.   More than 60 percent of the population is now fully vaccinated, but there are concerns that the healthcare system could easily become overwhelmed again in a new virus wave.

Bhartiya Kisan Union or BKU (Charuni) chief Gurnam Singh Charuni was arrested in UP's Meerut while going to Lakhimpur Kheri, where four farmers were among eight killed after violence broke out during a protest against a visit by two ministers. Another group of farmers have blocked the Rohtak-Panipat highway in Karnal. Mr Charuni is the face of the nine-month-long protest against three new farm laws and has been instrumental in keeping the protest alive in Haryana. In visuals, protesting farmers are seen gathered outside the Haryana Chief Minister's house while a line of police SUVs act as a barrier between the protesters and the gate. The Supreme Court on Monday sought responses from 43 farmers' bodies and their leaders, including Rakesh Tikait, Darshan Pal and Mr Gurnam, who are leading protests at Delhi's borders against the farm laws. The Haryana government went to the court alleging that the farmers have not been participating in talks to resolve the road blockade around the National Capital Region or NCR. Farmers in UP's Lakhimpur Kheri who had been protesting over yesterday's violence decided to call off the protest from Ground Zero and cremate the dead after the government announced hefty compensations for the dead and the injured.   The government has promised to pay a compensation of ₹ 45 lakh to the families of those who died. The injured will receive a compensation of ₹ 10 lakh. A retired judge will investigate the matter, the government has said. A murder case has been filed against Union Minister Ajay Mishra's son, Ashish Mishra, who, the farmers alleged, was driving one of the three vehicles that mowed down the protesters, which triggered the violence.

Thirty five current and former leaders are featured in roughly 11.9 million documents leaked from financial services companies that include reports of luxury mansions on the French Riviera, Monte Carlo and California. The so-called ""Pandora Papers"" were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and released in stories by media partners including The Washington Post, the BBC and The Guardian. Allegations range from corruption to money laundering and tax evasion. Holding assets offshore or using shell companies is not illegal in most countries, but the revelations are embarrassing for leaders who have pushed austerity measures or campaigned against corruption. While Russian leader Vladimir Putin is not named, he is linked via associates to secret assets in Monaco, including a waterfront home acquired by a Russian woman reported to have had a child with him. ""This is just a set of largely unsubstantiated claims,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""We didn't see anything on hidden wealth within Putin's inner circle."" Jordan rejected as ""distorted"" reports that King Abdullah II created a network of offshore companies and tax havens to amass a $100 million property empire stretching from California to London. - 'Nothing to hide' - Abdullah did not directly address the issue but denounced what he called a ""campaign against Jordan"". ""Attempts to embarrass Jordan have been going on for some time, and there are still those who want to sabotage it and sow suspicions,"" a royal court statement quoted him as saying to a group of tribal elders. ""We have nothing to hide"". The country's royal court said the properties were funded with the king's personal wealth and were used for official and private visits. Ivory Coast Prime Minister Patrick Achi also denied wrongdoing after allegations that he became the owner of Bahamas-based company Allstar Consultancy Services Ltd through a trust that obscured his ownership. Achi's office denounced the ""malicious use seemingly being made of this information"" that dates back to the late 1990s when he was an adviser to Ivory Coast's energy minister. Achi ""will not allow his name to be linked with illicit activities and thereby sullied"", the statement added. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said the papers would ""enhance financial transparency"", but sidestepped allegations that his family owned 11 offshore companies worth millions of dollars. ""The movement of illicit funds, proceeds of crime and corruption thrive in an environment of secrecy and darkness,"" said Kenyatta, the son of independent Kenya's first president. Czech PM hits back The ICIJ found links between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials. Among them were more than a dozen serving heads of state and government, country leaders, cabinet ministers, ambassadors and others. More than two-thirds of the companies were set up in the British Virgin Islands. Family and associates of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev -- long accused of corruption in the central Asian nation -- are alleged to have been secretly involved in property deals in Britain worth hundreds of millions. The documents also show how Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis -- who faces an election later this week -- failed to declare an offshore investment company used to purchase a chateau worth $22 million in the south of France. ""I have never done anything illegal or wrong,"" Babis tweeted, calling the revelations a smear attempt aimed at influencing the election. Nearly two million of the 11.9 million leaked documents came from a Panamanian law firm called Alcogal. Alcogal has rejected accusations of shady dealings. ICIJ's director Gerard Ryle said in a video accompanying the investigation that those best placed to halt such practices were the ones benefiting the most. 'Promotes corruption' Transparency International's Maira Martini called for an end to the offshore industry, saying the investigation once more offered ""clear evidence"" of how it ""promotes corruption and financial crime"". European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc needed to do ""more work"" to combat tax evasion. Among the other revelations from the ICIJ investigation: -- Britain's former prime minister Tony Blair is shown to have legally avoided paying stamp duty on a London property by buying the offshore company that owned it. -- Members of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's inner circle are said to secretly own companies and trusts holding millions of dollars. Khan vowed to ""take appropriate action"" if any wrongdoing is proved. -- Congo President Denis Sassou Nguesso and Gabon's Ali Bongo were linked with companies in the British Virgin Islands in a report by Le Monde, one of the media partners in the investigation. -- Colombian singer Shakira, the German supermodel Claudia Schiffer and the Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar are also named, with representatives for all three telling the ICIJ the investments were legitimate. The ""Pandora Papers"" are the latest in a series of mass leaks handled by the ICIJ, from LuxLeaks in 2014, to the 2016 Panama Papers.

Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat was hearing a case filed against Sharjeel Imam for the alleged speeches by him at two universities in 2019, where he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India. The speeches for which he was arrested were allegedly made at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13, 2019, and at the Aligarh Muslim University on December 16, 2019. He is in judicial custody since January 2020. He was arrested under the provisions of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). He has also been charged with sedition. Seeking bail as well as discharge in the case, advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir representing Imam told the court that being critical of the government cannot be a cause of sedition. “The essence of the entire prosecution is that you talk against us and sedition is on your way,” Mr Mir said, adding that Sharjeel Imam cannot be allowed to be persecuted just because he was critical of the CAA or the NRC. “This prosecution of Sharjeel Imam is more of a whip of a monarch rather than a government established by law. This is not how the government or executive has to respond. At the end of the day, a dispensation will change. Nothing is permanent,” the advocate further said. Referring to the recent 'Bharat Bandh' called by the protesting farmers, Imam's counsel asked, “Will we call for sedition in all those cases? Asking for rail roko, blocking of roads, etc, are those constitutional means of protest or not?” He asked whether sedition charges be imposed if farmers say that they want fair prices for the crops or people demand rights for women. Mr Mir said it is the duty of every citizen to be critical of the government. Since when does the government need the affection of people, he asked. “It is only the monarchs, Kings who need the affection of people. We are not here to bow down before the government,” the lawyer submitted. ""Unless and until we do not have critical elements in the society, society will die,"" he submitted. The lawyer said that there were many prosecutions against Imam just because he had criticized the government's policies. “He is not a terrorist or associated with some terrorist outfit. He has no criminal antecedents. He does not have any political agenda,” he told the court. Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad said that the fundamental right to protest cannot go beyond an extent that causes problems to the public at large. He told the court that violent riots took place pursuant to Imam's speech. “He tried to create an anarchy by saying that there is no hope left for the Muslim community and that there is no other way left,” Mr Prasad said, opposing his bail and discharge in the case.   Imam is accused of offenses relating to sedition, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, imputations prejudicial to national integration, and public mischief under the Indian Penal Code, and indulging in unlawful activities under the UAPA. The Delhi Police had filed a charge sheet against Imam in the case, in which it alleged that he allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the Central Government and instigated the people which led to the violence in December 2019."

This was conveyed by Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla to the Tamil leaders there during his separate interactions with them. Mr Shringla, who arrived in Sri Lanka on Saturday on a four-day visit, met leaders from the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), Tamil National People's Front (TNPF) and Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC), a political and trade union representing the central hill region's Tamils of Indian origin. ""Foreign Secretary @harshvshringla had separate and productive meetings with delegations from TNA, TPA and CWC,"" the Indian High Commission said in a tweet. ""He emphasised India's commitment to protecting the rights of Tamils through full implementation of the 13th amendment, early convening of Provincial Council elections, achieving reconciliation and establishing connectivity to India,"" it added. Mr Shringla earlier said that with the easing of the COVID-19 situation in Sri Lanka, it may be opportune for the two sides to work on connectivity initiatives like the Jaffna to Chennai flight, ferry services between Karaikal and Kankesanthurai and Dhanushkodi and Talaimanar, and the Buddhist corridor with the new international airport at Kushinagar. India has been consistently calling upon Sri Lanka to fulfill its commitments to protect the interests of the Tamil community and preserve the island nation's character as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society. The 13th Amendment provides for devolution of power to the Tamil community. India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement the 13th amendment which was brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987. The ruling Sri Lanka People's Party's Sinhala majority hardliners have been advocating a total abolition of the island's Provincial Council system established in 1987. There are nine provincial councils in Sri Lanka. Earlier in January, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar during his visit to Colombo spoke on the need to ensure aspirations of the minority Tamils are addressed within a united Sri Lanka. He had underlined India's backing for Lanka's reconciliation process and an ""inclusive political outlook"" that encourages ethnic harmony.   ""It is in Sri Lanka's own interest that the expectations of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace and dignity within a united Sri Lanka are fulfilled. That applies equally to the commitments made by the Sri Lankan government on meaningful devolution, including the 13th Amendment to the Constitution,"" he had said.

""China made commitments intended to benefit certain American industries, including agriculture, that we must enforce,"" US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a speech Monday. However the point of the negotiations in the coming days is ""not to inflame trade tensions with China,"" Tai said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. She also warned that President Joe Biden's administration is ""prepared to deploy all tools and explore the development of new ones"" to ""protect ourselves against the waves of damage inflicted over the years through unfair competition."" Tai announced the launch of ""a targeted tariff exclusion process"" for exemptions from customs tariffs imposed on $370 billion worth of Chinese goods a year implemented under former president Donald Trump. The punitive tariffs, imposed in retaliation for Chinese trade practices deemed ""unfair,"" are criticized by many companies. In August influential US business groups urged Biden to reduce the surcharges, pointing out that American industries faced ""increased costs"" as the tariffs are paid by importers. A senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the tariffs ""will remain in place"" for the duration of the exemption procedure. Biden, who took office in January, asked Tai to conduct a comprehensive review of US trade strategy towards China and the tariffs initiated by Trump. ""We continue to have serious concerns with China's state-centered and non-market trade practices"" that were not addressed in the ""Phase One"" agreement signed early last year to calm a trade war between the countries, Tai said. ""As we work to enforce the terms of Phase One, we will raise these broader policy concerns with Beijing."" The deal signed by Trump and Tai's opposite number, Vice Premier Liu He, committed Beijing to adding an extra $200 billion in purchases of US exports, including energy, agricultural and manufactured products through 2021. That is far from happening, trade analysts say. The Biden administration official did not specify the extent of the shortfall, while indicating that Washington is unsatisfied. ""There are some commitments that have not been met and we think the results overall of the agreement have been mixed,"" the official said, while stressing the US objective ""is not to escalate trade tension."" - 'Work with our allies' - Tai's speech highlighted the administration's strategy of teaming up with allied democracies in its competition with China. Trump, who rejected traditional US alliances, sparked worldwide market anxiety with his trade war. However, he ended up producing limited concrete results, let alone progress on the deep-seated problems that the United States and its allies say plague their trade ties with China. These include massive state subsidies for national companies, intellectual property theft and other factors creating a heavily uneven playing field. ""The core of our strategy is a commitment to ensuring we work with our allies to create fair and open markets,"" Tai said. Tai also stressed that the US-China trade relationship ""is one of profound consequence."" ""As the two largest economies in the world, how we relate to each other does not just affect our two countries. It impacts the entire world and billions of workers."" Overall, Washington sees a bleak outlook, with the administration official saying ""we know that China is unlikely to make meaningful reforms right now"" and that there is no push for starting long-awaited Phase Two negotiations. ""Beijing is increasingly explicit that it is doubling down on its authoritarian, state-centric approach, and is resistant to addressing our structural concerns,"" the official said. ""We recognize that China simply may not change and that we have to have a strategy that deals with China as it is, rather than as we might wish it be,"" they added. President of the National Foreign Trade Council Jake Colvin said Tai's remarks indicate ""the Biden administration recognizes that decoupling is not an option"" for the rival nations.   He called it ""encouraging"" to see ""the outlines of a comprehensive strategy to engage China firmly and directly while giving American businesses and workers the tools they need to compete effectively in the global marketplace.""

As part of the challenge, the twins summited two 4,000 m (13,000 ft) peaks in the Swiss Alps. The challenge was launched on International Women's Day this year as part of the women-only campaign, with an aim to encourage women-only teams to come together to ascend all the forty-eight 13,000 ft peaks in the Swiss Alps. The Malik twins successfully conquered Mount Breithorn (13,662 ft) and Allalinhorn (13,212 ft), Nungshi Malik said, ""We are thankful to Switzerland for inviting us to represent India and Indian women in this peak challenge. We have always dreamt of scaling the peaks here in the Swiss Alps, because we had heard so much about them from our peers, and the Alps did not disappoint!"" ""Both the peaks we scaled were in the car-free town of Switzerland - Zermatt. At the top of Allalinhorn, the weather was extremely windy at the top, and the temperatures dropped to -5 degrees Celsius. The mountain had lots of crevasses to negotiate in the beginning and exposed rock to climb towards the summit and was more technical than Breithorn,"" she added. Tashi Malik said, ""This was our very first time experiencing the Swiss Alps, the terrain here is so different to anything that we have done in the past especially in the Himalayas. But it was an amazing adventure for, the visuals from the top of the mountain just took our breath away."" She continued, ""The climb to Breithorn was comparatively easier. We would encourage more women who are looking to step out of their comfort zones and try their hand at mountaineering, to visit Switzerland and scale these peaks. The sheer beauty of the Alps and joy of reaching the summit will inspire you to continue and become a seasonal mountaineer."" Over 400 women from across the world have taken on this challenge so far, including both seasoned mountaineers as well as women who have never climbed a 4,000-meter peak before. ""Inviting Tashi and Nungshi Malik to Switzerland for the peak challenge was an opportunity to connect global travellers, especially women mountaineers, and bring them together to discover all that Switzerland offers in its diverse landscape,"" said Ritu Sharma, Deputy Director, Switzerland Tourism. ""On the climb to Mount Breithorn, the twins were also accompanied by two more Indian women who are not professional mountaineers. We hope that India's representation in this Peak Challenge will inspire more women to try out the outdoor life by participating in high-altitude hikes, mountain biking and climbing or camping. Because we truly believe that there is no mountain a woman cannot scale, in the world or in her life!"" continued Ms Sharma.   The twins also attempted their first ever multi-pitch ascent on Riffelhorn, which is at an elevation of 9,603 ft. The steep bolted routes, slippery rock and exposed sections pose different challenges in themselves and give the peak a climbing grade of 4A. Apart from the climb, the twins also indulged in few fun activities like jet-boating in Interlaken, gliding across the dragon slider on Mount Pilatus, and visiting the Swiss Museum for Transport in Lucerne."

""For aviation, net zero is a bold, audacious commitment. But it is also a necessity,"" Willie Walsh, Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), told top airline executives meeting in Boston. ""The important decision that we must make today will secure the freedom to fly for future generations,"" said Walsh. IATA represents 290 member airlines comprising 82 per cent of pre-pandemic global air traffic, and its pledge follows the lead of Europe's aviation industry which has embraced the European Union's emissions goals. ""Many in this room -- individually or in groups -- have already taken this step,"" Walsh told the executives. ""For others, this will be an additional challenge at a very difficult time,"" with the industry hard hit by global effects of the coronavirus pandemic, continued Walsh. But for the association's membership as a whole, ""it will be a commitment behind which we must be united and determined to deliver on time,"" he added. ""It is the right thing to do. And together, it is possible."" The new commitment comes 12 years after the IATA unveiled its first plan to reduce airline CO2 emissions by 50 percent by 2050, compared to 2005 levels. Proof of the industry's good faith, Walsh assured, is that airlines ""invested hundreds of billions of dollars in more fuel-efficient aircraft,"" with fleet fuel efficiency improving by over 20 percent in a decade. The dramatic tightening of the mid-century targets did not require a vote, in accordance with IATA statutes, but was adopted by consensus, as no member raised a firm objection that would have blocked the move.   The meeting nevertheless saw Chinese airlines stress that the 2050 objective was inconsistent with the goal adopted by the government in Beijing, which aims for carbon neutrality by the year 2060.

517,Mon Oct 04 17:01:02 +0000 2021,"RT @ndtvfeed: Vaccinated Indians Not Covered Under UK's ""Simplified"" Travel Rules https://t.co/COUiuIdwa3 https://t.co/Me6BG15MuD",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/vaccinated-indians-not-covered-under-uks-simplified-travel-rules-2563817,"Vaccinated Indians Not Covered Under UK's ""Simplified"" Travel Rules","Britain's so-called ""simplified"" international travel system that scraps an amber list of medium COVID-19 risk countries took effect on Monday, but it offers no benefits for vaccinated Indians travelling to the UK. The UK angered India by not recognising fully vaccinated Indian travellers as part of the new rules announced last month, despite India-made Covishield among its listed globally eligible vaccine formulations. India, in retaliation, imposed its reciprocal measures on all British travellers -- irrespective of vaccination status -- requiring the same level of PCR tests and 10-day quarantine at declared destination, also effective from Monday. ""We continue to work with international partners, including India, to roll out our phased approach,"" a UK government spokesperson said. The UK's new system covers over 50 countries, including the US and European Union (EU) member-nations plus 18 others such as Canada, Japan and the UAE. Travellers from these countries can now travel to England without needing to complete a pre-departure test, a day 8 test or enter a 10-day self-isolation period. They require just a single PCR test on the second day after arrival in the UK. ""This builds on the UK government's successful pilot phase with Europe and the US, and brings the total number of countries in scope of the policy to over 50, with more countries and territories being added in the coming weeks,"" the Department for Transport said. India not being on the list of eligible countries means travellers are required to undertake all three tests -- pre-departure, day 2 and day 8 -- and self-isolate at a declared address, with the option of ""test to release"" from isolation after a negative PCR test on day 5. This effectively remains unchanged from India's amber list status already in place. Travellers from countries on the red list, around 54 in all, continue to be required to undertake a mandatory 10-day quarantine at a government-designated hotel, a requirement the UK government is said to be considering scrapping for a majority on the red list later this month. From the middle of this month, the British government also plans to replace PCR tests with a cheaper lateral flow test for vaccinated arrivals. However, the timeframe and details of this change remain unclear. Meanwhile, UK government sources said over the weekend that the extension of vaccine certification to additional countries will be reviewed approximately every three weeks and that it continues to engage with the Indian government on the issue. ""The UK is continuing to work on expanding the policy to countries and territories across the globe in a phased approach. We are continuing to engage with the government of India on technical cooperation to expand UK recognition of vaccine certification to people vaccinated by a relevant public health body in India,” sources said. ""We are working with an array of international partners and look forward to continuing the expansion of the policy to countries and territories across the globe in a phased approach. Extension of vaccine certification will be reviewed approximately every three weeks,” they added. The first three-week review mark since the UK's updated travel norms were first announced falls later this week. ""We are accelerating towards a future where travel continues to reopen safely and remains open for good, and today's rule changes are good news for families, businesses and the travel sector,” UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Monday. ""Our priority remains to protect public health but, with more than 8 in 10 people now fully vaccinated, we are able to take these steps to lower the cost of testing and help the sector to continue in its recovery,” he said. All arrivals into the UK, from any country, continue to be required to fill in a passenger locator form ahead of travel. Meanwhile, the UK's travel industry has welcomed the government's latest move on easing testing and quarantine restrictions. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents UK carriers, said: ""Things are moving in the right direction and the removal of these restrictions will make it easier and cheaper for people to travel."" However, he said the UK remained ""an outlier on arrivals testing for vaccinated passengers"". Airlines UK hopes to see more countries removed from the red list at the next update and further mutual recognition of vaccine status for those jabbed in other countries, he was quoted as saying by the BBC. Willie Walsh, head of industry body the International Air Transport Association, welcomed the change as a ""positive step"", saying the government's testing and quarantine restrictions had been both unscientific and costly.   ""People have been led to believe that the risk is people flying into the country. The risk was inside the country,"" he said.

Justice Rekha Palli, who was hearing a petition alleging that Muslim marriages here were being registered under the Special Marriage Act instead of the Compulsory Marriage Order, was informed by the Delhi government counsel that presently, the legal format for an application does not mention ""Muslim marriage"" or ""Christian marriage"" as one of the options. ""We are writing to the authorities to get it corrected. We will rectify for both Muslims and Christians,"" said Delhi government counsel Shadan Farasat. The petitioners - NGO Dhanak for Humanity and an aggrieved individual -- alleged that in the absence of an option to register under the Compulsory Marriage Order, Muslim marriages were being registered under the Special Marriage Act, which was discriminatory. The petitioners, represented by lawyer Utkarsh Singh, informed that in spite of the marriage of the second petitioner being a Muslim marriage and not an interfaith marriage, the couple, which escaped from their hometown to solemnise the marriage in Delhi, was being subjected to 30 days'' notice period under the Special Marriage Act. The lawyer explained the differences between the Compulsory Registration of Marriage Order and the Special Marriage Act. He said Compulsory Registration of Marriage Order is an avenue to provide registration of marriage solemnised in any religion. On the other hand, interfaith marriages are solemnised and registered under the Special Marriage Act (SMA), he said. The counsel for the Delhi government said that the marriage of the second petitioner would be registered under the Compulsory Marriage Order subject to the submission and verification of certain documents.   In view of the Delhi government's stand, the court said that no further orders were called for. The court had sought the Delhi government's stand on the petition in July."

Aryan Khan's parents Shah Rukh and Gauri Khan did not attend the bail hearing. ""Investigation is of prime importance and it needs to be carried out. It benefits both accused and investigator,"" a judge said while extending the custody of Aryan Khan and seven others. Aryan Khan was ""calm"" while his friends Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha broke down when the judge announced the decision. All eight were arrested on Sunday after the anti-drugs agency went undercover and raided a rave party on Saturday evening on the ""Cordelia""cruise sailing from Mumbai to Goa. The raids produced a haul of 13 grams of cocaine, 21 grams of charas, 22 pills of MDMA and 5 grams of MD, the anti-drugs bureau said. The drugs were found hidden in clothes, underwear and purses, reported news agency Press Trust of India, quoting an unnamed official of the anti-drugs bureau. The agency told the court that it needed Aryan Khan in custody till October 11 (Monday week) to question him. The Narcotics Control Bureau alleged that the case involves an international drug cartel. ""Unless we investigate the consumer how do we know who is the supplier, who is financing it,"" the agency said. ""Links in the form of chats etc. show the involvement of international cartel. It is a group of persons, like a gang,"" the agency's lawyer told the court, adding that ""code names"" were found in Aryan Khan's chats and links of bank and cash transfers that had to be verified. Aryan Khan argued that he was a special invitee to the cruise ship and ""cannot be roped in with the entire seizure in the case"". He said investigators found nothing in his bag and found 6 gm with Arbaaz Merchant, ""a small quantity"". He also said the officials had only found chats on his phone and ""WhatsApp chats without any recovery"" is of no significance. ""In my entire stay aboard I was not involved any drug usage,"" said senior lawyer Satish Maneshinde, appearing for Aryan Khan. ""One of the grounds for asking my custody is seizure of commercial quantity from other accused. Commercial quantity seized from other accused cannot be foisted on me. They are talking about international drug trafficking which is a very serious charge and has to be backed by evidence,"" said Aryan Khan. Aryan Khan has been accused of purchase, possession and use of banned substances.   Munmun Dhamecha today denied knowing him as anything other than a celebrity.

The central government argued that there can be ""no further farmer protests"" as incidents like Lakhimpur Kheri could not be allowed. Is the right to protest absolute? The Supreme Court said it would examine the question on October 21 and also go into whether farmers have the right to take to the streets when the issue at the core of their protest - the three new farm laws -- is in court. The Supreme Court was responding to a petition by a farmers' group that wants to stage a protest at Jantar Mantar in Delhi. The central government, while opposing it, referred to Sunday's violence. ""The events that took place in Lakhimpur Kheri yesterday... Eight died. Protests cannot happen like this,"" said Attorney General KK Venugopal, adding, ""My lordship, please say that when laws are already being dealt with, then protests cannot go on. It leads to unfortunate incidents."" The Supreme Court responded: ""When such events happen nobody takes responsibility. Loss of lives and property. Nobody takes responsibility."" The protesters were killed when violence broke out as a large group tried to stop a Union Minister's visit to Lakhimpur Kheri for an event. The farmers allege their colleagues were run over by a car in Union Minister Ajay Singh Mishra's convoy, driven by his son Ashish. The police have filed a case of murder against Ashish Mishra. A Rajasthan-based farmers' group has approached the Supreme Court for permission to launch a ""Satyagraha"" with 200 farmers at Jantar Mantar. The court had earlier lashed out at protest groups for ""strangulating the city"" and had asked the petitioner to file an affidavit stating that they are not part of the groups blocking the highways. The Supreme Court objected to petitioners filing a plea in the Rajasthan High Court against farm laws and also demanding permission to protest at Jantar Mantar.   ""When you have already challenged the law you can't be allowed to protest? You can't come to court and then also protest outside? If the matter is already sub-judice protests cannot be allowed,"" the court said. ""When the government has already said that it's not implementing the laws yet and there is a stay on it from the Supreme Court, then why are you protesting?"" - Justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar asked."

Mr Meena had on Sunday alleged that the question paper and the answer sheet of the Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teachers (REET) were leaked before the exam commenced. The exam was held on September 26. Mr Meena further claimed that the answer sheet was leaked with the involvement of an official of the secrecy wing of the board. Reacting to the allegations, the board Chairman, DP Jaroli, ruled out the possibility. ""The answer sheet the Rajya Sabha MP is talking about has not been sent for printing anywhere till date. The original answer sheet is safely kept with me,"" he said. ""The entire process is done under my supervision. Hence, this is not right to say that the answer sheet was leaked on mobile phones. Making allegations is very easy,"" Jaroli told reporters in Ajmer. He said the question papers were dispatched to district-level committees headed by district collectors on September 23 and these were kept in high security. The chairman said the board has the experience of conducting exams with fairness as it conducts the exams of secondary and senior secondary classes every year. The opposition BJP has alleged that the question paper of REET was leaked. The Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha also held a protest on the issue in all districts on Monday.   After several irregularities and negligence came to light in the conduct of the exam, the state government suspended a Rajasthan Administration Services (RAS) officer, two Rajasthan Police Services (RPS) officers, a head constable, two constables and over a dozen personnel of the Education Department.

Extra doses of both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were also approved for people with severely weakened immune systems by the Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency (EMA). ""Comirnaty booster doses may be considered for people aged 18 years and older, at least six months after the second dose,"" the EMA said in a statement, referring to the brand name for the Pfizer vaccine. ""Decisions for boosters will be taken by public health bodies at national level."" The EMA's medicines experts had ""evaluated data for Comirnaty showing a rise in antibody levels when a booster dose is given,"" it said. ""The risk of inflammatory heart conditions or other very rare side effects after a booster is not known and is being carefully monitored,"" the EMA added. Rare cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, have been reported in people who have taken the Pfizer vaccine, especially in young men. Separately the EMA gave the green light for people with ""severely weakened immune systems"" to get extra doses of Moderna and Pfizer at least 28 days after their second dose. Two doses are sometimes not enough to produce sufficient antibodies in immunocompromised people, such as organ transplant recipients.   ""Although there is no direct evidence that the ability to produce antibodies in these patients protected against Covid-19, it is expected that the extra dose would increase protection at least in some patients,"" the EMA said.

The defence ministry said it scrambled aircraft to broadcast warnings after 36 fighter jets, 12 H-6 nuclear-capable bombers and four other planes entered its southwest air defence identification zone (ADIZ). Four more fighters entered the zone in a night sortie, bringing the total to 56 planes, the ministry added. The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), Taiwan's top China policy-making body, accused Beijing of ""seriously damaging the status quo of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"" with its recent string of larger incursions. ""We demand the Beijing authorities immediately stop its non-peaceful and irresponsible provocative actions,"" MAC spokesman Chiu Chui-cheng said in a statement. ""China is the culprit for causing tensions between the two sides of the (Taiwan) Strait and it has further threatened regional security and order,"" he added, saying Taiwan ""will never compromise and yield"" to threats. The ADIZ is not the same as Taiwan's territorial airspace but includes a far greater area that overlaps with part of China's own air defence identification zone and even includes some of the mainland. Self-ruled democratic Taiwan lives under the constant threat of invasion by China, which views the island as its territory and has vowed to one day seize it, by force if necessary. In the last two years Beijing has begun sending large sorties into Taiwan's defence zone to signal dissatisfaction at key moments -- and to keep Taipei's ageing fighter fleet regularly stressed. Nearly 150 Chinese warplanes had breached Taiwan's ADIZ since Friday when Beijing marked its National Day with its then biggest aerial show of force, buzzing the island with 38 planes. That was followed by another incursion by 39 planes on Saturday, sparking criticism from Washington. ""The United States is very concerned by the People's Republic of China's provocative military activity near Taiwan, which is destabilising, risks miscalculations, and undermines regional peace and stability,"" US State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement on Sunday. ""We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure and coercion against Taiwan."" Ramping up pressure China's foreign ministry hit back on Monday, accusing Washington of sending out ""an extremely wrong and irresponsible signal"" with ""provocative"" actions such as selling arms to Taipei and sending its warships to the Taiwan Strait. ""The US should correct its mistakes, earnestly abide by the 'one China Principle' ... prudently and appropriately handle the Taiwan issue, stop bolstering 'Taiwanese independence' separatist forces,"" said spokeswoman Hua Chunying. Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taiwan since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, who rejects its stance that Taiwan is part of ""one China"". Under President Xi Jinping, Chinese warplanes are crossing into Taiwan's ADIZ at an unprecedented rate. Last year a record 380 Chinese military jets made incursions into Taiwan's defence zone, and the number this year as of early October has already exceeded 600. Last week 24 Chinese warplanes flew into the zone after Taiwan applied to join a major trans-Pacific trade pact, a move Beijing has opposed. Friday's show of force came the same week China accused Britain of ""evil attentions"" after it sent a frigate to sail through the Taiwan Strait, which Beijing claims as its own waterway. Xi has described Taiwan becoming part of the mainland as ""inevitable"". US military officials have begun to talk openly about fears that China could consider the previously unthinkable and invade.   Monday's incursion ""was a way for Beijing to tell Washington that it will not submit to US warnings, that it, not Washington, sets the rules in this part of the world,"" said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based analyst at the University of Nottingham's Taiwan Studies Programme.

Facebook and its WhatsApp and Instagram apps went dark at around noon Eastern time (1600 GMT), in what website monitoring group Downdetector said was the largest such failure it had ever seen. Around 5:45 pm ET, some Facebook users began to regain partial access to the three apps. The outage was the second blow to the social media giant in as many days after a whistleblower on Sunday accused the company of repeatedly prioritizing profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation. ""To every small and large business, family, and individual who depends on us, I'm sorry,"" Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer tweeted, adding that it ""may take some time to get to 100%."" Shares of Facebook, which has nearly 2 billion daily active users, fell 4.9% on Monday, their biggest daily drop since last November, amid a broader selloff in technology stocks. Security experts said the disruption could be the result of an internal mistake, though sabotage by an insider would be theoretically possible. ""Facebook basically locked its keys in its car,"" tweeted Jonathan Zittrain, director of Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. Soon after the outage started, Facebook acknowledged users were having trouble accessing its apps but did not provide any specifics about the nature of the problem or say how many users were affected by the outage. Several Facebook employees who declined to be named said that they believed that the outage was caused by an internal routing mistake to an internet domain that was compounded by the failures of internal communication tools and other resources that depend on that same domain in order to work.   Facebook, which is the second largest digital advertising platform in the world, was losing about $545,000 in U.S. ad revenue per hour during the outage, according to estimates from ad measurement firm Standard Media Index.

In her virtual speech at the 48th session of UN Human Rights Session Anne Heckendorff said, ""It is well-known that the menace of terrorism in South Asia has largely grown out of religious schools, the so-called Madrassas. These schools that often times instill a distorted, ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam still flourish uninhibitedly in Pakistan and Afghanistan"". ""The Taliban and the dreaded Haqqani network were born from such Madrassas in Pakistan. Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and other terrorist organisations continue operating such terror factories in Pakistan under the protection of the country's powerful intelligence agency,"" she said. In Pakistan and Afghanistan, there are numerous illegal ""madrasas'' or religious schools which force the youth towards ""jihad''. They teach them hatred against other religions and motivate them towards gun culture. ""The International Community must not be appeased with the Taliban's false promises of education. What is schooling worth, if instead of raising a workforce capable of leading their country onto a path of peace and development, creates foot soldiers indoctrinated into a worldview defined by misogyny and hatred?,"" Ms Heckendorff told UNHRC.   ""The lack of economic independence of the Taliban and their patron State next door has a silver lining: it gives leverage to the international community. Leverage that must be used to prevent the loss of another generation of young Afghans to Madrassa-bred radicalism"", she said in her speech. The research analyst concluded by saying, ""Placing conditions on diplomatic and economic engagement to ensure human rights-conform education, without which the right to development can hardly be realized, is the most meaningful investment we can make in Afghanistan's future""."

Vibha, who ran a small vegetable shop in the area with her husband, allegedly got in a quarrel with the accused, who was drunk, the police said. ""As she tried to ward him off with a broom and some stones, the accused took the weapon from his bag and attacked her,"" the police said. She was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital where the doctors declared her dead on arrival, they added. The police were attacked and their vehicle damaged when they reached the spot and tried to save the accused from the locals, the police said. The police have arrested five people in the case for obstructing government work and damaging a police vehicle. The accused will be arrested once he is discharged, they said."

The island's Ngurah Rai International Airport will be open to international travelers from South Korea, China, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and New Zealand as of October 14, maritime and investment minister Luhut Panjaitan told a press conference. The partial reopening, however, does not include Australia -- a key source of tourists before the pandemic. ""Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali will open internationally on 14th October 2021, as long as it meets the provisions and requirements regarding quarantine, Covid-19 tests, and the readiness of the Task Force,"" Panjaitan said. He did not elaborate if tourists will be eligible to visit the island or if only those with a residence permit could come. All international travellers will be required to have proof of hotel booked for a quarantine of at least eight days at their own expense, but it remains unclear what other restrictions may apply beyond that. Indonesia was devastated by the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus and, in mid-July, it recorded over 56,000 new Covid cases in just one day. The government announced emergency restrictions in the hardest hit area, shutting down non-essential businesses and limiting people's movement. Bali's tourism-dependent economy was also hit hard by the pandemic as millions of visitors disappeared from the palm-fringed island. But case numbers are now falling as the government ramps up vaccinations, with the country reporting 922 new Covid-19 cases and 88 deaths on Monday. Authorities have begun a steady easing of restrictions as the country sees a decrease in daily confirmed Covid cases and deaths, including in Bali.   Malls, movie theatres and offices in most cities have begun to reopen at reduced capacity and some schools have begun partial offline learning.

A murder case has been filed against Mr Mishra's son Ashish Mishra. Protesters allege that he was driving the car that ran over farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri. The group of protesting farmers had gathered to block the Union Minister and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya from visiting the area as they were upset over a recent speech by Mr Mishra. The two ministers were on their way to an event nearby. Later, Mr Mishra, the Union Minister of State for Home, denied his son had anything to do with the deaths. When he was asked to comment on a video that showed his son waving a gun at the protest site, he said the weapon ""must be"" licensed. ""If my son had a revolver, it would have been licensed. I was not there, neither was my son,"" Mr Mishra told reporters, blaming the violence on a ""Khalistani hand"". He also said neither he nor his son had been questioned by the Uttar Pradesh police. ""We are not aware of any FIR. People who filed the FIR know that neither me nor my son were at the site. We were three-four km away at a programme. There were miscreants who attacked workers with sticks and swords. You saw the way they were beating up people. If my son had been there, he would not have survived,"" Mr Mishra said. ""My son was present at the Deputy Chief Minister's event all through and I was with Mr Maurya too,"" he added. The Minister's defence came as the farmer deaths quickly snowballed into a massive political fight, months before the UP election.   Opposition leaders - from Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to Akhilesh Yadav - were stopped from visiting the area today. The Congress alleged that Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel and Punjab Deputy Chief Minister SS Randhawa were stopped from landing at Lucknow airport. The Congress said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was arrested late last night by policemen who stopped her convoy at Sitapur, on its way to Lakhimpur Kheri."

""I was a part of the Bhatta Parsaul movement and had taken part in the foot-march. The then BSP government had targeted farmers, totally disregarding their self-respect. Today, the same situation is prevailing. After Bhatta Parsaul, there was a change of government in Uttar Pradesh and there will be a change of government in the state now,"" Mr Hooda, who was detained in Sitapur while he was on his way to Lakhimpur Kheri, told PTI over the phone. In 2011, two policemen and two farmers were killed in clashes following protests over acquisition of land in Greater Noida's Bhatta Parsaul, a Jat-dominated village that had become the epicentre of agitation against land acquisition in the country. Back then, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had visited Bhatta Parsaul disguising his identity and riding pillion on a two-wheeler being driven by his senior party colleague Digvijay Singh as a mark of solidarity with the farmers protesting against the land acquisition taking place under the then Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh. Mr Hooda, one of the four Congress leaders including party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who were detained in Sitapur while they were on their way to Lakhimpur to meet the family members of the dead farmers on Sunday night, rejected the ruling BJP's claims that it has done a lot of work for the welfare of farmers. ""Had it done good work for the farmers, the farmers would not have to stage protests on the roads,"" he said. Regarding the allegations levelled by the BJP that non-farmers, especially political activists, penetrated into the farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday, leading to the incident, Mr Hooda said, ""The protest is led by farmers and they are the heroes of the movement. Every farmer is emotionally associated with this agitation. As a responsible opposition, we are extending full support to it and we have the right to do so."" With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attacking the Opposition for raising the farmers' issue in view of next year's Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, he stressed that the issue of farmers is much bigger than elections. Asked if his party will give poll tickets to the family members of the farmers who lost their lives in Sunday's violence, the Congress leader said, ""This is an issue of the farmers, which is bigger than the elections."" Sharpening his attack on the BJP, he accused it of being arrogant and showing scant regard to the farmers' demands. ""The BJP has ignored the demands of the farmers and has occupied the throne of arrogance from where the 'pagdhi' of the farmers is not visible,"" Hooda said. Recalling the moments of late Sunday night, when the Congress delegation was leaving for Lakhimpur, he said only four party leaders decided to go as section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was imposed in the area. ""At every crossing, we were stopped. If security forces in this strength were deployed in Lakhimpur Kheri, the violence could have been prevented,"" Mr Hooda said. ""The incident has embarrassed humanity. The minister has not resigned yet nor has he been removed. He must resign on moral grounds,"" he said, referring to Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Kumar Misra, whose son has been named in an FIR filed at the Tikonia police station in connection with Sunday's incident. Mr Hooda also claimed that the Congress leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi, were manhandled by the policemen, adding, ""That is not an issue. The real issue is that of the farmers.""   Eight people were killed as violence erupted during a farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday, claiming the lives of both farmers and BJP workers ahead of a visit by Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya.

The science fiction television show aired for only three seasons starting in 1966, but was hugely influential in popular culture and spawned several movies and spin-off series. It was notable for the utopian vision of its creator Gene Rodenberry, who envisaged a society where humanity had put aside its divisions and united with other peaceful space-faring civilizations. Shatner, as Kirk, commanded the USS Enterprise on a five-year mission ""to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.""

Blue Origin also announced the identity of the remaining passenger, Audrey Powers, the company's vice president of mission and flight operations. They will join Chris Boshuizen, a former NASA engineer and co-founder of Planet Labs, and Glen de Vries, a co-founder of clinical research platform Medidata Solutions, on the sub-orbital flight. The news comes as Bezos's company is under a cloud of allegations relating to a ""toxic"" work culture with rampant sexual harassment. The claims, firmly rejected by Blue Origin, were outlined in a lengthy blog post signed by Alexandra Abrams, the company's former head of employee communications, last week. The post said it also represented the views of 20 other workers and ex-workers in various divisions who wanted to remain anonymous. Abrams and her co-authors further alleged the company had a pattern of decision-making that prioritized speedy rocket development over safety, and that several of them would not feel safe in the company's New Shepard rocket.   Bezos, the world's wealthiest man, his brother Mark, aviation pioneer Wally Funk, and paying customer Oliver Daemen flew into space on Blue Origin's first crewed flight on July 20.

Justice Amit Bansal said besides ₹ 40 lakh, another ₹ 17 lakh shall be paid to the home buyer by November end. The court said this amount of ₹ 40 lakh shall be utilised by the man for repayment of the loan. The court was informed that the total amount due to the home buyer was around ₹ 1.79 crore, out of which ₹ 50 lakh has been paid to him in pursuance of the court's September 24 order. As the principal amount was ₹ 1.07 crore, the court asked the realtor to first clear that after which the builder shall place before it the payment plan. The court had on September 24, stayed an order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) sentencing Supertech's MD Mohit Arora to 3-year imprisonment and issuing an arrest warrant against him for non-compliance with an order in the case by the home buyer. The high court had directed the realty firm to deposit ₹ 50 lakh, out of the outstanding ₹ 1.79 crore, in the home buyer's account within a week to show its bona fide to the court. On Monday, initially, Supertech's advocate Vikas Sethi submitted that the company proposes to pay the whole amount with ₹ 10 lakh installment every month. The court, however, said the amount has to be substantial. Advocates Shailesh Madiyal and Vrinda Kapoor, representing homebuyer Kanwal Batra, said the firm shall pay at least the principal amount in the near future so that he can repay the loan and get some money for his daughter's marriage. The court said, ""you must be reading newspapers that how difficult it is nowadays in these matters. He (Batra) should be grateful for whatever he is getting now. Rather than seeing the glass half empty, see it as half full. The bottom line is that you get back your money."" The court listed the matter for further hearing on November 11, when the realtor shall give his payment plan. The high court was hearing Supertech's plea challenging the September 20 order by which Arora was given 3-year jail and the arrest warrant was issued against him for non-compliance with NCDRC directions. The NCDRC case pertained to the home buyer's complaint about the delay in giving possession of a villa in one of the company's projects in Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Area, which was allotted for over ₹ 1 crore. Earlier, Supertech's counsel had argued that the NCDRC order was beyond the provisions of section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act and there was no provision it which casts vicarious liability on the MD to make him liable in criminal or civil matters in case of default by the company. The plea was opposed by the home buyer's counsel who had said the company was in repeated default of the NCDRC order and has gone back on its undertaking to the forum. The high court was earlier informed that the arrest warrant was issued on September 20 by the NCDRC which had on September 13 rejected Supertech's plea for fixing 12-month instalments for payment of the decretal amount. In April 2019, the NCDRC had ordered the company to either give possession of the villa within six months, along with compensation and costs or refund the entire amount received by it along with compensation. On July 20, the MD had assured the NCDRC that the order would be complied with within 60 days. However, on September 20, NCDRC noted that despite the commitment, the order was yet to be implemented and opined that the company was ""evading the implementation of the decree"".   It had thus issued an arrest warrant against the MD and sentenced him to three years imprisonment subject to the implementation of the order within a week. ""In view of non-compliance of the direction and dishonouring his own commitment, we sentence the MD of the Judgement Debtor company, as per powers under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, for three years imprisonment and issue warrants of arrest against the managing director of the Judgment Debtor company. The warrants shall not be executed, if the Judgment Debtor deposits the decretal amount before this Commission within one week,"" it had said."

Resistance within families and concerns over sharing information over social media that could identify people involved are also acting as deterrents, according to six female protesters Reuters spoke to across the country. Sporadic demonstrations by women demanding that the Taliban respect their civil freedoms have been captured on social media, as have the sometimes violent responses, drawing the world's attention to issues of equality and human rights. The last time the Taliban ruled in the 1990s, they banned women from work and girls from school, allowed women to leave their homes only when accompanied by a male relative and insisted that women wore all-enveloping burqas. Those who broke the rules were sometimes whipped in public by the Islamist terrorists ' ""moral police"". This time the Taliban are promising greater freedom for women, including in education and employment, in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic law. Yet older girls are still not back at school, there are no women in senior positions in the new government, the Women's Ministry in Kabul has been shut and the Taliban have said women will only be allowed to work in a small number of jobs. Women wanting to express their anger publicly are struggling to do so. Six who took part in demonstrations after the Taliban stormed to power on Aug. 15 said they had not done so since early September. ""We have a lot of plans to stage more protests, but unfortunately due to security concerns, we are not going out much right now,"" said Nasima Bakhtiary, a former commerce ministry worker in Kabul. ""We have seen so much harassment ... regarding our protests ... we have to be careful."" Earlier this month, the Taliban said protests were not banned, but that those wanting to hold demonstrations needed to seek prior permission and provide details of place, timings and slogans that would be chanted. Taliban spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment for this story. PROTESTS FADE Based on interviews with organisers, social media posts and advocacy groups, Reuters counted seven significant women-led protests between Aug. 15, when the Taliban came to power, and Sept 8. when they made permission necessary. Since Sept. 8, Reuters has counted one, on Sept. 19 outside the women's ministry building in Kabul after it was shut down. The sign outside has been switched to that of the Ministry for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice - the moral police. Maryam Sadat, a 23-year-old law student and protest organiser in Kabul, said she and a small number of others had tried to stage a demonstration on Sept. 30, but it was dispersed by members of the Taliban. Women have also been involved in broader protests, some of which have involved hundreds of people. Several people have been killed, some demonstrators have been beaten and the Taliban have fired warning shots in the air to disperse crowds. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights last month condemned the violence against protesters, including women. ""As Afghan women and men take to the streets during this time of great uncertainty in their country to press peacefully for their human rights to be respected ... it is crucial that those in power listen to their voices,"" it said. Women like Taranom Seyedi said they were scared to continue to demonstrate. The 34-year-old women's rights activist in Kabul who helped organise some of the protests there said she had received letters saying the Taliban had made a list of all the women who protested and would conduct house searches for them. She does not know who sent the letters, but has erased protest-related content from her social media accounts as a precaution, and said others had done so too. Sadat went further. ""Since my participation in the protest, I've had to relocate twice ... My family is terrified, and even my neighbours are concerned and urging me not to join."" Others spoke of pushback from those close to them, including Zulaikha Akrami, a 24-year-old international relations graduate who worked at a foreign non-profit organisation in the northeastern province of Badakhshan. ""My mother tried to threaten me not to go and said if you go, don't call me mother,"" said Akrami, referring to a demonstration she attended in Badakhshan on Sept. 8.   She said she recalled her younger brother telling her: ""If they beat you to death, I won't be there to pick up your body off the street.""

Farmers carrying black flags held the protest along the stretch of the agitation site at the Singhu border from 10 am to 1 pm. ""The protest was to express our anger over what happened in Lakhimpur Kheri, and to put forward or demands -- to suspend Union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra, to arrest those responsible under section 302 of IPC, and for the government to offer compensation to the families of the farmers who died,"" said farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar. Two FIRs were registered a day after clashes claimed the lives of eight people, including four farmers allegedly run over and four people in a convoy of BJP workers who were lynched, the incident propelling Lakhimpur Kheri as a new flashpoint in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. UP's Additional Chief Secretary, Home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said the state government will give ₹ 45 lakh each and a government job at the local level to the family members of the four farmers killed in Lakhimpur. ""FIR has been lodged against several persons, including Minister of State for Home, Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra,"" Mr Awasthi told PTI in Lucknow. ""From the latest reports that we have received, an FIR has been registered against the culprits, and we have been told that the entire matter would be investigated by a retired high court judge. We have also been told that the families of the farmers who died would be given ₹ 45 lakh worth of compensation, and those injured would receive ₹ 10 lakh,"" said Avtar Mehma, another farmer leader. Similar protests were held at the district headquarters in other parts of the country including Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Karnataka, the leaders claimed. Reacting to reports that Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi was denied permission to visit Lakhimpur Kheri, farmer leader Yogendra Yadav tweeted, ""Preventing leaders of the opposition, including former CM of UP and the sitting CMs of other states from meeting the farmers shows that UP govt has something to hide."" ""These draconian measures are becoming a pattern in BJP ruled states & only reflect the insecurity of the BJP(sic),"" he added. The Lakhimpur Kheri incident comes ahead of the farmers' protest against the three contentious farm laws completing a year next month. Thousands of farmers from different parts of the country have been camping at the Delhi borders since November 26 last year, demanding the repeal of the three new farm laws. While the farmers have been expressing fear that the laws would do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of the corporations, the government has been projecting them as major agricultural reforms.   Over 10 rounds of talks between the two parties have failed to break the deadlock. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

Rajesh Malik of Cornoustie Management, who acted as the legal heir of plots of Unitech Group and allegedly cheated people by selling them non-existent plots in Noida, has also been arrested, sources said. Early this year, the agency filed a criminal case under various sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against the Unitech Group and its promoters -- Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra – over allegations that they illegally diverted over ₹ 2,000 crore to Cyprus and the Cayman Islands. ""Total proceeds of crime in this case is ₹ 5,063.05 crore as determined till now,"" the agency had said.   In March, raids were conducted at 35 locations in in Mumbai and the National Capital Region belonging to the Unitech Group and several others -- Shivalik Group, Trikar Group, and Carnoustie Group.   In July, the Enforcement Directorate attached a London hotel worth ₹ 58.61 crore in connection with the money laundering probe. The hotel, named Bed and Breakfast, is owned by a company called Ibournshorne Limited, a UK-based associate firm of the Carnoustie group. This was part of the Chandras' properties in India and abroad attached by the agency, the overall valuation of which is around ₹ 600 crore. Ramesh Chandra and his sons -- Sanjay and Ajay Chandra – are also accused of allegedly defrauding Canara Bank of ₹ 198 crore.   In a complaint filed in November last year, the bank had said Unitech - which had been a customer since 1971 and availed various credit facilities - had defaulted on multiple payments.   Two months ago, the Chandra brothers were shifted from Delhi's Tihar Jail to Mumbai's Arthur Road and Taloja Jail after the Enforcement Directorate told the Supreme Court that it found a ""secret underground office"" in South Delhi's Green Park, which they were using ""while on parole or bail"" to influence witnesses. The Supreme Court, which had ordered the shift, said the agency in its report, mentioned their connivance with Tihar Jail staff in flouting orders, breaking jail rules and undermining the jurisdiction of the court."

The project on National Highway-40, for which ₹ 1,600 crore has been approved, is expected to reduce congestion on the feeder road adjoining the city and shorten travel time between Shillong and Dawki. Mr Naidu, after the virtual foundation-laying ceremony at the State Convention Centre, said that the road, once upgraded, will ease transportation of goods, step up service delivery and contribute to the overall development of the region. He called for fast-tracking of all developmental activities in the northeastern states with proper utilisation of the funds provided by the Centre. ""If we can expedite all projects here without delay or diversion, northeastern states have the potential to become the growth engines of the country,"" Mr Naidu emphasised, adding that the ""development of the nation is incomplete without the development of this region"". Expressing happiness over the ""dip in insurgency-related activities"" in the northeast, he underlined that peace is prerequisite for progress. The vice president, who is on a tour of the northeast region for 12 days, arrived in Meghalaya on Monday. Observing that rains often hinder construction activities on the hilly terrains, Mr Naidu said, ""Technical institutions around the country must take this as an opportunity and come up with innovative road designs, while cutting down on the implementation period of the projects."" Noting that there has been a marked improvement in air connectivity in the northeast, he suggested that more direct flights should be made available to and from the eight states. Describing Meghalaya as a ""beautiful place with enormous tourism potential"", Mr Naidu further said that concerted efforts by the central and state governments will help improve infrastructure in the state, thus drawing more visitors. He, however, insisted that care must be taken to ensure that the pristine ecological system is not disturbed in any manner. Referring to the importance of agro-entrepreneurship in states like Meghalaya, the vice president said that there lay immense opportunities for budding entrepreneurs to add value to the supply chain. ""There is a great opportunity to market and showcase our indigenous horticultural varieties to the world,"" he said, referring to Lakadong turmeric and ginger powder, which have gained popularity across the country and abroad. He urged youth to become agro-entrepreneurs and handhold small farmers to ensure that their products get the right price in the market. The vice president also congratulated Rebecca Vanessa Suchiang, who was present at the event, for becoming the first native woman to hold the chief secretary's post in Meghalaya. He added that her achievement will inspire the youth of the state to take up government service. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari had sent a video message on the occasion, congratulating the state for the Shillong-Dawki road project.   Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma, who was present at the function, maintained that the road will also improve connectivity between Guwahati and the ports. ""Once this road is built, it will take 10 hours to reach Chittagong port from Guwahati. We will no longer have to travel via Kolkata which involves a journey time of 30 hours,"" Sangma added."

The central government argued that there can be ""no further farmer protests"" as incidents like Lakhimpur Kheri could not be allowed. Is the right to protest absolute? The Supreme Court said it would examine the question on October 21 and also go into whether farmers have the right to take to the streets when the issue at the core of their protest - the three new farm laws -- is in court. The Supreme Court was responding to a petition by a farmers' group that wants to stage a protest at Jantar Mantar in Delhi. The central government, while opposing it, referred to Sunday's violence. ""The events that took place in Lakhimpur Kheri yesterday... Eight died. Protests cannot happen like this,"" said Attorney General KK Venugopal, adding, ""My lordship, please say that when laws are already being dealt with, then protests cannot go on. It leads to unfortunate incidents."" The Supreme Court responded: ""When such events happen nobody takes responsibility. Loss of lives and property. Nobody takes responsibility."" The protesters were killed when violence broke out as a large group tried to stop a Union Minister's visit to Lakhimpur Kheri for an event. The farmers allege their colleagues were run over by a car in Union Minister Ajay Singh Mishra's convoy, driven by his son Ashish. The police have filed a case of murder against Ashish Mishra. A Rajasthan-based farmers' group has approached the Supreme Court for permission to launch a ""Satyagraha"" with 200 farmers at Jantar Mantar. The court had earlier lashed out at protest groups for ""strangulating the city"" and had asked the petitioner to file an affidavit stating that they are not part of the groups blocking the highways. The Supreme Court objected to petitioners filing a plea in the Rajasthan High Court against farm laws and also demanding permission to protest at Jantar Mantar.   ""When you have already challenged the law you can't be allowed to protest? You can't come to court and then also protest outside? If the matter is already sub-judice protests cannot be allowed,"" the court said. ""When the government has already said that it's not implementing the laws yet and there is a stay on it from the Supreme Court, then why are you protesting?"" - Justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar asked."

The 23-year-old was sent to the custody of anti-drugs agency Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) till Thursday by a Mumbai court. Aryan Khan's parents Shah Rukh and Gauri Khan did not attend the bail hearing. ""Investigation is of prime importance and it needs to be carried out. It benefits both accused and investigator,"" a judge said while extending the custody of Aryan Khan and seven others. Aryan Khan was ""calm"" while his friends Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha broke down when the judge announced the decision. All eight were arrested on Sunday after the anti-drugs agency went undercover and raided a rave party on Saturday evening on the ""Cordelia""cruise sailing from Mumbai to Goa. The raids produced a haul of 13 grams of cocaine, 21 grams of charas, 22 pills of MDMA and 5 grams of MD, the anti-drugs bureau said. The drugs were found hidden in clothes, underwear and purses, reported news agency Press Trust of India, quoting an unnamed official of the anti-drugs bureau. The agency told the court that it needed Aryan Khan in custody till October 11 (Monday week) to question him. The Narcotics Control Bureau alleged that the case involves an international drug cartel. ""Unless we investigate the consumer how do we know who is the supplier, who is financing it,"" the agency said. ""Links in the form of chats etc. show the involvement of international cartel. It is a group of persons, like a gang,"" the agency's lawyer told the court, adding that ""code names"" were found in Aryan Khan's chats and links of bank and cash transfers that had to be verified. Aryan Khan argued that he was a special invitee to the cruise ship and ""cannot be roped in with the entire seizure in the case"". He said investigators found nothing in his bag and found 6 gm with Arbaaz Merchant, ""a small quantity"". He also said the officials had only found chats on his phone and ""WhatsApp chats without any recovery"" is of no significance. ""In my entire stay aboard I was not involved any drug usage,"" said senior lawyer Satish Maneshinde, appearing for Aryan Khan. ""One of the grounds for asking my custody is seizure of commercial quantity from other accused. Commercial quantity seized from other accused cannot be foisted on me. They are talking about international drug trafficking which is a very serious charge and has to be backed by evidence,"" said Aryan Khan. Aryan Khan has been accused of purchase, possession and use of banned substances.   Munmun Dhamecha today denied knowing him as anything other than a celebrity. Munmun Dhamecha's lawyer, Ali Kashif Khan Deshmukh, told NDTV, ""She has no connection with the accused and the drugs the NCB claims to have seized were found on the ground and not on her person. She has no contact with the other accused and knows accused number 1 only as a celebrity. She is from Madhya Pradesh and came here for a job and got arrested. That's why she broke down when she saw her brother."""

Vilks died together with two police bodyguards on Sunday in a collision with an oncoming truck near the small town of Markaryd in southern Sweden. ""We want to completely exclude an external act targeting the car in which Lars Vilks found himself,"" Stefan Sinteus, chief of the South Sweden regional investigation unit, told a press conference. ""There is nothing to indicate that, but we want to be certain so we can rule it out,"" he added. Police said they have yet to determine the reason why the vehicle that was carrying Vilks and the two officers swerved off the road, breaking through a metal barrier before hitting a truck travelling in the opposite direction in the oncoming lane. A tyre explosion is one of the hypotheses. Both vehicles then caught fire and all three passengers died at the scene. The driver of the truck was injured and taken to hospital where he was questioned by investigators. 75-year-old Vilks lived under almost continuous police protection due to numerous threats and attacks from Islamists after his 2007 caricature depicting Mohammed as a dog was published in a Swedish newspaper. But on Monday police said there had been no new concrete threats against him recently. On February 14, 2015, a young Danish man of Palestinian origin opened fire when he tried to storm a debate on freedom of expression in Copenhagen, organised after the deadly attack on the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.   Vilks escaped unharmed but a 55-year-old Danish film director and a guard at Copenhagen synagogue were both shot dead by the gunman, who was himself killed in a stand-off with Danish police.

""COP26 in Glasgow represents an urgent summons to provide effective responses to the unprecedented ecological crisis and the crisis of values that we are presently experiencing, and in this way to offer concrete hope to future generations,"" Francis said. The leader of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics, who is hoping to attend the UN talks, issued the plea in writing to members of a Vatican-hosted conference called Faith and Science: Towards COP26. It brought together scientists and religious leaders ahead of the landmark two week summit that kicks off on October 31 in Scotland. The Vatican participants were due to sign an appeal denouncing the ""seeds of conflict -- greed, indifference, ignorance, fear, injustice, insecurity and violence"", which in turn ""cause the serious wounds we are inflicting on the environment, such as climate change, desertification, pollution and loss of biodiversity"", the pope said. Anglican leader Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, one of the religious leaders attending the Vatican conference, said the world needed ""a pilgrimage to a clean economy, which decreases carbon emissions and increases renewable energy development and use"". ""We have in the last 100 years declared war on the creation,"" he said, calling for a ""dramatic and rapid change in taxation and trade rules"" in favour of a more sustainable economic model. ""The world has just enough time to get this right,"" he insisted. Last month, Francis, Welby and Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomew I issued another plea for climate action, saying they felt compelled to ""call on everyone, whatever their belief or worldview, to endeavour to listen to the cry of the Earth"". Less than one month from the COP26 climate summit, world leaders are under unprecedented pressure to decarbonise their economies and chart humanity's path away from catastrophic global warming.   But with the pandemic still raging in parts of the globe and with countries already battered by climate-driven calamities pleading for help, the negotiations in Glasgow are likely to be fraught.

The last time a case of a similar nature got world attention was when three men in a van smashed into pedestrians, killing at least eight people in a terrorist attack on London Bridge in 2017. What happened in Lakhimpur Kheri yesterday was no less an act of terror than what happened in London. In fact, it was worse, as it was a terrorist act by state players. Ajay Mishra, the minister concerned, is directly responsible for what occurred. Call it by its name - a cold-blooded terror attack. A week or so earlier, the minister had openly threatened peacefully protesting farmers. In a public speech, he called farmers ""cowards"" and dared them to protest with black flags in his presence so that he could teach them a lesson. He threatened that none of them ""would remain"" in his area. Is this the sort of language that should be used by a union minister? Yesterday, he was part of an official programme involving the Chief Minister of UP when farmers gathered in protest against his provocative speech. The official meeting was cancelled. The farmers were in fact dispersing when speeding cars in the official convoy, in which the minister's son was present according to farmers, knocked down some of them. There was retaliation and four others were killed. In the face of a snowballing protest agitation by farmers not just in Lakhimpur but across India, the Adityanath Government has been forced to file an FIR against the minister's son. However, no arrests have been made and no case has been filed against the minister. The demand of the farmers that the minister should be sacked is legitimate and deserves support. Equally objectionable is the lockdown imposed in the area and the arrests of Opposition leaders travelling to Lakhmipur Kheri to express their sympathy for and condolences to the families of those killed. This is a direct assault on democracy. The truth is that the BJP's style of governance is based not on the Constitution of India but on the politics of division and dictatorship. The BJP has tried to divide farmers in the name of religion, language and region. When it failed to do so, it used intimidation and threats and false cases. When even that failed to cow down farmers, it has apparently licensed its ministers to use the power of their government positions to raise armies of anti-socials and criminals to directly attack farmers. Mishra's statement provoking and abusing farmers has been followed by one from the Chief Minister of Haryana. On the very day that farmers were being mowed down and killed, Khattar was inciting his partymen in Haryana to arm themselves with lathis to ""reply"" to farmers. ""Don't be afraid of going to jail"" he said, ""you will become leaders that way."" Earlier a farmer had been killed and several injured after an officer of the Haryana government was filmed saying that his men should ""break heads"" of protesting farmers. And yesterday, Chief Minister Khattar was brazenly instructing his party men to unleash violence against farmers. A case should be filed against him for inciting violence. In any other country, in the wake of such chilling brutality as in Lakhimpur, the head of the national government would at least have issued a statement of regret or even condolence. Even Donald Trump, known for his racist bigotry, expressed his condolences to the family of George Floyd, albeit four days after the brutal killing. But 'Howdy Modi' has maintained a deafening silence as though it does not concern him or his government. The silence of the Home Minister Amit Shah is equally shocking. Just a few days ago, both these leaders were showering praise on the Adityanath Government for its imaginary successes, but in the face of this shocking atrocity, they now have nothing to say. This itself is a message of support from the very top leaders of the government. The farmers of India have struggled for their right to be heard for the last ten months. Their demand to be consulted before any laws are made in their name, and to withdraw the three laws made in their name without their consent is important not just to protect their interests but as a principal of democratic governance. Their movement is historic in its peaceful nature, its unity and its sacrifice. The BJP is getting desperate in the face of the growing support to farmers and its political implications and impact. The horrific killings in Lakhimpuri Kheri only underline the need for expressions of solidarity with the farmers by each citizen of India.

That's how these two people who are being called farmers must have been injured,"" Mr Mishra added. ""People who did such things cannot be called farmers. India's farmers are not so heartless and cruel. The fault lies with the people who are leading the farmers' organisation. This is a democracy everyone has the right to have their say and wave their flag but peacefully,"" he said.   Farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri, who have been protesting over yesterday's violence, decided to call off the protest from Ground Zero and cremate the dead after the government announced hefty compensations for the dead and the injured on Monday.

560,Mon Oct 04 11:40:21 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: A Three-Day Work Week? One Startup Experiments To Draw Talent https://t.co/1aIkcAZltz https://t.co/qOt3Yvg3pO,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/a-three-day-work-week-one-startup-experiments-to-draw-talent-2563421,A Three-Day Work Week? One Startup Experiments To Draw Talent,"A shortage of technology talent has Indian companies offering sweeteners like more vacation time and gender-neutral parental leave as they compete for graduates and professionals. One Bengaluru startup is trying a more dramatic solution: a three-day work week. Fintech company Slice is offering new hires a three-day week with salary at 80% of the going market rate. This is a win-win approach that frees the workers to pursue other passions or interests -- or other gigs -- while still locking in a steady pay and benefits from Slice, said Rajan Bajaj, the company's founder. ""This is the future of work,"" Mr Bajaj, 28, said in a phone interview. ""People don't want to be tied down to a job."" Global investors are pouring billions of dollars into tech startups in the country, putting entrepreneurs under pressure to ramp up teams. A massive talent crunch has ensued as IT outsourcers, Silicon Valley giants, global retailers and Wall Street banks' technology centers vie for engineering and product talent alongside hundreds of fast-growing startups. Slice is betting that its approach will make it stand apart from the competition. The company has 450 employees and wants to recruit 1,000 engineers and product managers in the next three years. ""It's the best of both worlds,"" Mr Bajaj said. ""Workers can get salary and full benefits working a three-day week, and spend the rest of their time chasing a startup dream, looking for a co-founder or pursuing a non-work passion."" The move toward shorter weeks has been underway for at least a century. In 1926, Henry Ford adopted a five-day work week in place of the typical six days, after experiments showed productivity wouldn't suffer as a result. Companies and countries have experimented with four-day weeks for years without widespread adoption. Proponents of shorter weeks now point to studies showing a boost in employee productivity and well-being, prompting countries such as Ireland and Iceland to try them out. Technology behemoth Amazon.com Inc. piloted a four-day week for select employees in 2018, and even China is trying to rein in its excessive working hours. Just as in Silicon Valley, the Indian startup industry's work-centered culture is leaving some engineers disenchanted while some are milking the opportunity for all its worth. Engineers' salaries have tripled in the past three years, Mr Bajaj said. Bidding wars are common and workers are known to ghost startups after multiple rounds of pay negotiations. Founders joke on social media about advertising on matchmaking and food delivery apps to obtain workers. Such is the hiring bonanza that Bhavish Aggarwal, founder of ride-hailing startup Ola and electric-car startup Ola Electric Mobility Pvt., tweeted recently in half jest that he was thinking of outsourcing work to a cheaper destination -- the San Francisco Bay Area. Flush with capital, startups are also spending on other initiatives to attract engineers and designers. Social commerce platform Meesho announced a companywide 10-day break in November so workers can unplug and rejuvenate. Fintech startup BharatPe has proffered referral goodies like BMW bikes, gadgets and cricket holidays in Dubai. Slice began offering its three-day option on Monday, and it is betting its timing is opportune: millions of engineers are preparing to return to in-person work, after nearly two years of being confined to working from home. The startup, founded in 2016, specializes in offering credit cards to the young across the country. Its physical card launched in 2019 with the company touting sign-ups of less than a minute, cashbacks and multiple payment options. Slice issued 110,000 cards last month, making it among the country's top providers. Its backers include Japan's Gunosy Capital and India's Blume Ventures.   The new hires will form small teams and work on newer cryptocurrency or ""buy now pay later"" products. Existing employees are eligible for the program ""provided they are a fit,"" Mr Bajaj said. ""A three-day work week allows us to recruit a certain caliber of talent because it's a perk big tech companies like Google and Amazon don't offer,"" he said. "

The protesters burnt effigies of the Centre and the UP government at various places and raised slogans against the BJP. Holding demonstrations outside the offices of deputy commissioners, the farmers demanded that Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra be sacked in connection with the violence. The demonstrations were held at Patiala, Mohali, Ferozepur, Amritsar, Rupnagar, Moga and Muktsar in Punjab, and Ambala, Kurukshetra and Fatehabad in Haryana and UT Chandigarh. The protesters also demanded action against Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar for his remarks against farmers. Mr Khattar on Sunday had talked about ""tit-for-tat"" during a meeting of the BJP's Kisan Morcha in Chandigarh when he told the gathering to form groups of 500 to 1,000 and be prepared to even go to jail. Eight people were killed on Sunday as violence erupted during a farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri, claiming the lives of both farmers and BJP workers ahead of a visit by UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. Four of the dead were people in the cars, apparently a part of a convoy of BJP workers who had come to welcome the UP deputy chief minister. They were allegedly thrashed to death. The four others were farmers, officials said.   An FIR has been registered against the Union minister's son and several other persons in connection with the violence.

""Farmers have been run over allegedly by the car of a minister's son (in Lakhimpur Kheri).

The investigation involving some 600 journalists from outlets including The Washington Post, the BBC and The Guardian is based on a leak of some 11.9 million documents from 14 financial services companies around the world. The files were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and published Sunday. President Vladimir Putin is not directly named but he is linked via associates to secret assets in Monaco, notably a waterfront home acquired by a Russian woman reported to have had a child with him. ""This is just a set of largely unsubstantiated claims,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said of the leaks. ""We didn't see anything on hidden wealth within Putin's inner circle,"" Peskov said, adding it was not clear ""how this information can be trusted"". The leaks reveal that the $4 million Monaco property was purchased through an offshore company towards the end of 2003 for the woman -- a native of Putin's hometown Saint Petersburg -- who was previously reported to have had a relationship with him. Russian investigative outlet Proekt reported in November last year that the woman, Svetlana Krivonogikh, had at one point worked as a cleaner, and was the mother of Putin's child. The purchase of the property went ahead shortly after Krivonogikh reportedly gave birth, the leaks showed. The media consortium said Krivonogikh had not responded to requests for comment. Graft reporters silenced Proekt last year described Krivonogikh as an elusive millionaire who lives in Russia's former imperial capital and is the recipient of expensive gifts from Kremlin-connected individuals. It said facial-recognition analysis of photographs obtained by their reporters showed Krivonogikh's daughter bears a close resemblance to Putin. The investigative outlet was earlier this year declared an ""undesirable organisation"" by authorities as part of a broader crackdown on dissenting voices, banning its work in Russia under the threat of jail time. Putin has guarded his private life jealously and once famously told journalists to keep their ""snotty noses"" out of his business. He divorced his wife Lyudmila in 2013. The ICIJ found links between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials, including more than a dozen serving heads of state and government. More than two-thirds of the companies were set up in the British Virgin Islands. The Kremlin, however, said the leaks were evidence of illicit action in the United States. ""The only thing that actually catches the eye is the demonstration of which state is the world's biggest offshore and tax lacuna. And, this is, naturally, the United States,"" Peskov said. The Pandora leaks also revealed that the head of a state-run television network, Konstantin Ernst -- who oversaw the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics -- was gifted a stake in a billion dollar Moscow property deal. The Kremlin has grown accustomed to rebuffing claims of corruption among the political elite. The country's most prominent opposition figure Alexei Navalny over the last decade has grown a loyal following with detailed investigations that targeted the wealth of the Kremlin's inner circle, including Putin.   Navalny was jailed this year on old fraud charges, but his probe into a luxurious Black Sea mansion allegedly gifted to Putin and released after he was jailed helped spark protests.

Wildlife officials found the green turtles Friday during patrols near the city of Semporna, in Sabah state. They also found sacks of suspected turtle meat, a stove, and a knife at the scene, Sabah Wildlife Department director Augustine Tuuga said. Efforts are ongoing to catch the perpetrators but none have been arrested. It is a crime in Malaysia to target protected turtles, punishable by jail terms and fines. The department said such crimes in the area are usually committed by the Bajau Laut, a community of sea-dwelling nomads who typically live on boats off Borneo. The massive island is shared between Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. Green turtles are one of the largest sea turtles, and are classified as endangered by protection group the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).   They face multiple threats, including being targeted by poachers, caught in fishing gear, and having their eggs harvested.

The research was conducted on 6,195 patients over the age of 18 who were diagnosed with Covid between March 4 and August 27, 2020 across 12 hospitals and 60 clinics in the US. The researchers from US' University of Minnesota and Basel University in Switzerland analysed the relationship between 90-day anti-coagulation therapy among out-patients before Covid-19 diagnosis and the risk for hospitalisation and mortality. The researchers also evaluated the association between anti-coagulation therapy, which is used to prevent blood clots, and mortality risk among admitted patients. The study found that patients on blood thinners before contracting Covid-19 were 43% less likely to be admitted to hospital, despite being older and having more chronic medical conditions than their peers. Blood thinners, regardless of being used before being infected with Covid-19 or started when admitted to the hospital for treatment of the viral disease, reduce deaths by almost half, they added. The researchers noted that, overall, hospitalised Covid patients benefit from blood thinners regardless of the type or dose of the medication used. ""Many individuals with Covid-19 develop abnormal blood clots from high inflammation, which can lead to serious health complications and mortality,"" said study lead author Sameh Hozayen, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota. ""Blood thinners are medications prescribed to prevent blood clots in patients with a prior blood clot in their lungs or legs. They also prevent blood clots in the brain secondary to abnormal heart rhythms, like atrial fibrillation,"" Sameh Hozayen wrote in the journal. The researchers said blood thinners are the standard of treatment in these diseases, which is why they looked at data to see if it impacted hospitalisations related to Covid-19. ""We already know that overwhelmed hospitals have a higher risk for death among their patients, so reducing hospitalisation may have a positive impact during a Covid-19 surge,"" he added. The researchers also noted that about half the patients prescribed blood thinners for blood clots in their legs, lungs, abnormal heart rhythms or other reasons do not take them. Increasing adherence for people already prescribed blood thinners can potentially reduce the bad effects of Covid-19, they said. ""At most centers around the world now, there are protocols for starting blood thinners when patients are first admitted to the hospital for Covid-19 - as it is a proven vital treatment option,"" he said.   ""Outside of Covid-19, the use of blood thinners is proven to be lifesaving for those with blood coagulations conditions,"" the scientist added. The team is currently working with research groups in other parts of the world such as Egypt to look at how blood thinners impact patients in less-invested health care systems and in different patient populations."

The other seizures were not from any of them and with whom he has no connections,"" Mr Manshinde said. Asking the court to consider his bail, Aryan Khan said: ""One of the grounds for asking my custody is seizure of commercial quantity from other accused. Commercial quantity seized from other accused cannot be foisted on me. They are talking about international drug trafficking which is a very serious charge and has to be backed by evidence. WhatsApp chat without any recovery is not of significance... in several cases learned judges have granted bail and not tagged entire seizure"".

The high-profile drug raid that led to his arrest from a cruise ship off the coast of Mumbai -- where a rave party was apparently in progress -- yielded 13 grams of cocaine, 21 grams of charas, 22 pills of MDMA and 5 grams of MD, the Narcotics Control Bureau has said. The drugs were recovered from suspects who had concealed them in their clothes, undergarments and purses, reported news agency Press Trust of India, quoting an un-named official of the Narcotics Control Bureau. Besides Aryan Khan, seven others were arrested after the drugs-control team boarded the Goa-bound ship, disguised as passengers. According to officials, the party began after the ship left Mumbai. Initially the eight people – Aryan Khan, Munmun Dhamecha, Nupur Sarika, Ismeet Singh, Mohak Jaswal, Vikrant Chhoker, Gomit Chopra and Arbaaz Merchant – were taken for questioning and were later formally arrested. The agency lawyer told the court today that some more arrests were made this morning.   ""Links in the form of chats etc. show the involvement of international cartel. It is a group of persons, like a gang,"" the agency's lawyer told the court. ""We have also raided the supplier and found commercial quantity in his Juhu residence. We have found some code names in his chat and we have to decode that. There are links of bank and cash transfer which we need to verify,"" he said.

No cases were registered in January, two in February, five in March, 10 in April, 12 in May, seven in June and 16 in July, it said. In the previous years, the dengue cases in the same period were 2,133 in 2016, 2,152 in 2017, 650 in 2018, 356 in 2019 and 266 in 2020, the report added. Malaria, dengue and chikungunya are accompanied with high fever and therefore, doctors feel that people might suspect that they have contracted COVID-19. Civic bodies in Delhi have intensified their measures to prevent outbreak of vector-borne diseases. The Delhi government was alert and all prepared to handle any situation that might arise out of dengue cases, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had told reporters early September. He recently also said that the government's anti-dengue drive, '10 Hafte, 10 Baje, 10 Minute' has been running for the last few weeks to raise awareness on its prevention, and it will be further intensified. Jain also told reporters that instructions have been issued to the heads of various departments of the city government to take part in its anti-dengue campaign on working days, to ensure no breeding of mosquito larvae are found on its premises. North Delhi Mayor Raja Iqbal Singh recently had told reporters that the North Delhi Municipal Corporation would run an intensive week-long campaign from October 2-7 to keep vector-borne diseases under control. South Delhi Mayor Mukesh Suryan had alleged that the Delhi government was playing ""campaign politics"" when it came to the fight against the vector-borne diseases, and termed its anti-dengue drive an ""eyewash"". Standing Committee Chairman of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation Jogi Ram Jain recently held a meeting with the officials of the public health department on prevention of dengue, malaria and chikungunya. Jain directed officials to conduct awareness campaigns in all areas under the NDMC so that maximum people can be made aware. He had also directed them to regularly check for breeding of mosquito larvae on premises of government buildings, schools, offices, community buildings and dispensaries.

Farmers say that the son of union minister Ajay Mishra was driving the car; the minister has emphatically denied the allegations, but his son, Ashish Mishra, is the only person named in murder case.  The government of Uttar Pradesh has said the family of each farmer who died will be given 45 lakhs and that a retired High Court judge will determine who was responsible for the deaths. Apart from the farmers, a journalist and three BJP supporters were killed A after angry crowds erupted in violence and set several cars on fire. Farmer leaders say that the four killed by the minister's convoy include an 18-year-old.    The violence is the worst since famers began a protest over a year ago against three new farm laws introduced by the centre, which farmers say, are designed to help corporates and are against their basic interests. The centre refutes this and says the laws will bring much-needed reforms to modernize agriculture and ensure better prices for produce.  At Lakhimpur Kheri yesterday, hundreds of farmers were convened at a protest site when a car in Mr Mishra's convoy, consisting of three vehicles, hit them. The minister later said that the driver of the car, who was not his son, lost control after stones were flung at it.   The police have banned gatherings, cut off mobile internet services, sent extra forces and detained several opposition figures on their way to the scene including Priyanka Gandhi from the Congress party. Speaking exclusively to NDTV, Ms Gandhi said she had been arrested, not detained. ""I am under arrest but the minister has not resigned, his son has not been arrested,"" she said, alleging ""a complete collapse of democracy"". In Lucknow, Samjawadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav was also detained.  Dozens of opposition supporters staged a protest in the city and set fire to at least one police vehicle this morning. "

The central government argued that there can be ""no further farmer protests"" as incidents like Lakhimpur Kheri could not be allowed. Is the right to protest absolute? The Supreme Court said it would examine the question on October 21 and also go into whether farmers have the right to take to the streets when the issue at the core of their protest - the three new farm laws -- is in court. The Supreme Court was responding to a petition by a farmers' group that wants to stage a protest at Jantar Mantar in Delhi. The central government, while opposing it, referred to Sunday's violence. ""The events that took place in Lakhimpur Kheri yesterday... Eight died. Protests cannot happen like this,"" said Attorney General KK Venugopal, adding, ""My lordship, please say that when laws are already being dealt with, then protests cannot go on. It leads to unfortunate incidents."" The Supreme Court responded: ""When such events happen nobody takes responsibility. Loss of lives and property. Nobody takes responsibility."" The protesters were killed when violence broke out as a large group tried to stop a Union Minister's visit to Lakhimpur Kheri for an event. The farmers allege their colleagues were run over by a car in Union Minister Ajay Singh Mishra's convoy, driven by his son Ashish. The police have filed a case of murder against Ashish Mishra. A Rajasthan-based farmers' group has approached the Supreme Court for permission to launch a ""Satyagraha"" with 200 farmers at Jantar Mantar. The court had earlier lashed out at protest groups for ""strangulating the city"" and had asked the petitioner to file an affidavit stating that they are not part of the groups blocking the highways. The Supreme Court objected to petitioners filing a plea in the Rajasthan High Court against farm laws and also demanding permission to protest at Jantar Mantar.   ""When you have already challenged the law you can't be allowed to protest? You can't come to court and then also protest outside? If the matter is already sub-judice protests cannot be allowed,"" the court said. ""When the government has already said that it's not implementing the laws yet and there is a stay on it from the Supreme Court, then why are you protesting?"" - Justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar asked."

Many Asian countries are scrambling to lock in supplies of the potential treatment early after they lagged behind Western nations in COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, hit by tight supplies. South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia said they are all in talks to buy Merck's potential treatment, while the Philippines, which is running a trial on the pill, said it hopes its domestic study would allow access to the treatment. They all declined to provide details on purchase negotiations. Somsak Akksilp, director-general of the Department of Medical Services, told Reuters that Thailand is currently working on a purchasing agreement for the antiviral drug, known as molnupiravir. The molnupiravir pills, designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus, would be the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19. Interim clinical trials indicated it could reduce by around 50% the chance of hospitalisation or death for patients at risk of severe disease from COVID-19. ""We are now working on a purchasing agreement with Merck that is expected to be completed by this week ... we have pre-booked 200,000 courses,"" Somsak said He said the pills could arrive as soon as December, though the deal would be subject to the pills' approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Thai regulator. Representatives at Merck's Thailand office were not immediately reachable. Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Thailand fell below 10,000 on Monday for the first time since mid-July. The country has administered 55.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far, fully inoculating about 31% of the population. Merck has said it expects to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of 2021. It has a U.S. government contract to supply 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir at a price of $700 per course. The company has said it plans a tiered pricing approach based on country income criteria.   In the Philippines, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire told a regular news conference on Monday that, ""We see we can have more access to this medicine because we have this clinical trial counterpart.""

BMC counsel Anil Sakhare also told the HC that 2,586 bed-ridden people have so far been administered both the doses of COVID-19 vaccine while 3,942 such people have got the first jab. ""The work is on. It is going on smoothly. Now, there is no shortage of vaccines too. Mumbai is safe. We do not see a third wave (of the COVID-19) coming,"" Mr Sakhare said. A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation filed by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari earlier this year, seeking a direction to both the Union and Maharashtra governments to start door-to-door vaccination for senior citizens aged 75 and above, specially-abled people and those who are bed-ridden. The plea said such people would not be in a position to step out of their houses to go to the vaccination centres and inoculated. The Union government had earlier said it would not be able to start a door-to-door vaccination programme, but last month gave a go ahead to it. The Maharashtra government in August said it would initiate the drive and had started door-to-door vaccination of bed-ridden people as a pilot project. On Monday, Dhruti Kapadia told the court that the purpose of filing the PIL was served as now even the Centre has framed a policy to vaccinate such people at their homes.

He said that there are ""enormous"" benefits of taking this approach, which include reduced climate risk, more jobs, and better health and well-being. ""City leadership in using green materials and constructing energy-efficient, resilient buildings powered by renewable energy, is essential to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,"" said Antonio Guterres in his message for World Habitat Day, marked on Monday. The theme for this year's celebration of cities and towns worldwide is ""Accelerating urban action for a carbon-free world."" According to UN News, cities are responsible for about 75 per cent of the world's energy consumption and over 70 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Urban areas across the globe are facing the dual crises of COVID-19 and climate change, said the UN chief. The publication said that 4.5 billion people live in cities today, but that population is projected to grow by almost 50 per cent, by 2050. By mid-century, over 1.6 billion urban residents may have to survive through average summertime highs of 35 degrees Celsius, the report added. According to Mr Guterres, cities and towns are at the core of climate action to keep the 1.5 degrees goal within reach. ""Three-quarters of the infrastructure that will exist in 2050 has yet to be built,"" UN chief said. ""Economic recovery plans offer a generational opportunity to put climate action, renewable energy, and sustainable development at the heart of cities' strategies and policies."" Amid the growing population in emerging economies, demand for transport, which accounts for nearly 20 per cent of global carbon emissions, is also multiplying. In this context, the UN Chief said cities are already working on this, trying to ensure that this demand is met by zero-emission vehicles and public transit.   Mr Guterres concluded asking for a global moratorium on internal combustion engines to underpin these efforts, saying it should happen by 2040 at the latest.

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna issued notice to the Centre on the plea and sought its response. “It is very important for consumer protection, because builders try to put any number of clauses in the agreement which common people may not be aware of. There should be some uniformity in the agreement. It is important that this (model builder buyer agreement) is achieved in the country,” the bench said. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for petitioner advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, said there should be a model agreement prepared by the Centre as some states have it and some don't, and there is no uniformity in those agreements. The bench said that it is an interesting matter as it has earlier dealt with Real Estate Regulations Act and knows its importance. Singh said that in states which have model agreements, builders try to influence the conditions to be incorporated and hence, the Centre should frame it and directions be issued to all the states and Union Territories to implement the model agreement. Senior advocate Maneka Guruswamy, appearing for a group of home buyers, said that they are also seeking the implementation of the model agreement to safeguard the interest of consumers. She said they support the submissions of Singh. The bench said it is issuing notice to the respondents and seeking the Centre's response. The PIL filed by Upadhyay has sought direction to the Centre to frame model pacts for builders and agent buyers to protect customers and bring in transparency in the realty sector in line with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) Act, 2016. The plea, which was filed in October last year, has also sought a direction to all states to enforce 'Model Builder Buyer Agreement' and 'Model Agent Buyer Agreement' and to take steps to avoid ""mental, physical and financial injury"" to customers. ""Promoters, builders and agents use manifestly arbitrary one-sided agreements that do not place customers at an equal platform with them, which offends Articles 14, 15, 21 of the Constitution. There have been many cases of deliberate inordinate delays in handing over possession and customers lodge complaints but the police don't register FIRs, citing arbitrary clauses of the agreement, the plea said. Due to deliberate excessive delays in possession, real estate customers are not only suffering mental and financial injury but also a brazen violation of their right to life and livelihood, stated the PIL filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey. ""Builders issue revised delivery schedules again and again and adopt arbitrary unfair restrictive trade practices. All this amounts to criminal conspiracy, fraud, cheating, criminal breach of trust, dishonestly inducing delivery of the property, dishonest misappropriation of property and violation of corporate laws,"" said the plea. It contended that many developers across the country still follow a common practice of pre-launching a project without securing requisite approvals from the authorities and term it ""soft launch"" or ""pre-launch"", thus openly violating the law, but no action has been taken against any builder till date.   ""It is necessary to state that registration of the project with the regulatory authority has been mandatory before it is launched for sale and for registration the basic pre-requisite is that the developer must have all the requisite approvals. ""Thus the buyer is protected as the project is ring-fenced from the vagaries of non-approvals or delays in approvals which are one of the major causes of delay for the project,"" the plea said."

A bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana made the observation when it was requested by lawyer Prashant Bhushan that the plea of NGO, ""Association for Democratic Reforms"", not be deleted from the list of matters scheduled for hearing on October 8. ""Friday (October 8) is the last day (before Dussehra break). We may not be able to take it up (for hearing),"" said the bench which also comprised Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli. The NGO, which had filed the PIL in 2017 on the alleged issue of corruption and subversion of democracy through illicit and foreign funding of political parties and lack of transparency in the accounts of all political parties, had filed an interim application in March this year before the assembly polls in West Bengal and Assam seeking that window for sale of electoral bonds be not reopened. The NGO, in its application filed in the pending petition had claimed that there is a serious apprehension that any further sale of electoral bonds before the upcoming Assembly elections, including in West Bengal and Assam, would further ""increase illegal and illicit funding of political parties through shell companies"". It had alleged that as per data on electoral bonds declared by political parties in their audit reports for 2017-18 and 2018-19, the ""ruling party had received more than 60 per cent of the total electoral bonds issued till date."" The application had claimed that so far more than ₹ 6,500 crore worth of electoral bonds have been sold with the majority of donations going to the ruling party. On January 20 last year, the court had refused to grant interim stay on the 2018 Electoral Bonds Scheme and sought responses of the Centre and the Election Commission on an interim application by the NGO seeking stay on the scheme. The government had notified the Electoral Bond Scheme on January 2, 2018. As per provisions of the scheme, electoral bonds may be purchased by a person, who is a citizen of India or incorporated or established in India. An individual can buy electoral bonds, either singly or jointly with other individuals. Only political parties registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and which secured not less than 1 per cent of votes polled in the last general election to the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly of the State, are eligible to receive electoral bonds. As per the notification, electoral bonds shall be encashed by an eligible political party only through a bank account with an authorised bank. It said that the electoral bonds scheme has opened the ""floodgates to unlimited corporate donations"" to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy. It said the Election Commission and the Reserve Bank of India had in 2017 ""objected to electoral bonds and had advised against the issuance of electoral bonds as a mode for donation to political parties."" It alleged that almost 99 per cent of the electoral bonds purchased are of value one crore and 10 lakh denominations which shows that it is not individual citizens but large corporations which are purchasing these bonds with a view to receive kickbacks from the government. It had earlier claimed that certain amendments made in Finance Act, 2017 and earlier Finance Act, 2016, both passed as money bills, have opened doors to unlimited political donations, even from foreign companies and thereby legitimising electoral corruption at a huge scale, while at the same time ensuring complete non-transparency in political funding. The Election Commission had told the top court that it has received status of filing of electoral bonds from various political parties, including the BJP and the Congress, in a sealed cover. The EC had filed an affidavit in the top court in pursuance to the April 12, 2019 direction asking the political parties to furnish all details of funds received through electoral bonds to the poll panel in a sealed cover. The court had in April 2019 declined to stay the Centre's Electoral Bond Scheme 2018 and made it clear that it would accord in-depth hearing on the pleas as the Centre and the EC have raised ""weighty issues"" having ""tremendous bearing on the sanctity of the electoral process in the country"".   The Centre and the EC had earlier taken contrary stands in the court over political funding, with the government wanting to maintain anonymity of donors of bonds and the poll panel batting for revealing names of donors for transparency.

The High Court also quashed the order to initiate criminal proceedings against those who are not implementing the order. In May, the Kerala government had issued an order to reduce the RT-PCR test rates in the state from ₹ 1700 to ₹ 500. A bench of Justice TR Ravi also directed the state government to hold discussions with owners and representatives of private laboratories and take a fresh decision in this regard. The Court's ruling came on the petitions filed by Accredited Molecular Testing Laboratories and Devi Scans Private Limited seeking to set aside the order. The petition contended that ""the state government has no power to issue an order fixing rate for tests in private labs."" The order was issued without jurisdiction and in violation of principles of natural justice. The average cost of conducting an RT-PCR test as per the present norms and quality standards comes to around ₹ 1500 per test, the plea read. ""Any revision in the existing rates would detrimentally affect their interest as well as the quality of the RT-PCR test.

On this, the state government submitted a report in the court and stated, ""the cost of kits, consumables have drastically come down and the argument of the private labs is that the only way to move forward is to use test kits that are cheaper and not up to the mark in getting an accurate result was without any basis.""

A bench, headed by Justice MR Shah, said no state government should deny the compensation on the ground that cause of death on the death certificate is not COVID-19. ""If the death certificate does not cite the cause of death as COVID-19, then aggrieved parties may approach the concerned officials of the district committee. DDMA (District Disaster Manangement Authority) address and contact details need to be published in all media for awareness.

In its last hearing, the Supreme Court had expressed satisfaction with the Centre's Covid compensation plan of 50,000 rupees for each past as well as future deaths. The compensation will be disbursed by the state government from their disaster relief funds.   On June 30, the top court had ordered the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to form guidelines for financial compensation to family members of persons who died due after contracting coronavirus. Subsequently, the Centre had filed an affidavit before the top court stating that it has recommended compensation of ₹50,000 for every person who succumbed to COVID-19."

K. Chandra Segaran, 58, who had earlier been released from prison for another assault offence in December 2020, hurled racial insults and punched Brandon Ong, an ""SG Clean Ambassador"" on duty to ensure people wear masks over their mouths properly in public places, The Straits Times reported on Monday. Chandra, a driver, was sentenced to seven weeks in jail on Friday after he pleaded guilty to one count each of assault, harassment and an offence under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Joseph Gwee said that on April 18, Ong and an auxiliary police officer spotted Chandra walking around the Maxwell Food Centre with his mask below his chin. He was not consuming any food or drinks at the time. Ong asked Chandra to wear his mask properly but he ignored the volunteer. When Ong repeated his request, Chandra punched the volunteer on the left side of his face and verbally abused him. The auxiliary police officer's body-worn camera recorded Chandra's act. ""Whilst the victim was not a law enforcement officer or public servant in the strict sense, the victim was merely trying to request that the accused abide by the law.   ""From the footage, we can hear that the accused had defiantly told the victim and the witness that he would give them trouble if they wanted it. The accused's reaction was completely unwarranted and occurred after he had punched the victim on the face,"" the DPP said. The SG Clean Ambassador network of volunteers was launched in March 2020."

Mr Sibal said, ""As a citizen, I think there should a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge. Before that, the Union Minister must be dismissed or suspended at least during the inquiry as the incident took place with respect to his convoy."" He also said that the inquiry should not be conducted by their own people who will defend these inquiries. Reacting to the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, Mr Sibal said, ""This is the symbol of the arrogance of political party that is power. The ruling party is giving a message that they can do whatever they want and even run a car over those who are protesting."" He also said that the Prime Minister is elected from Uttar Pradesh and the home minister is responsible for the state of the affairs in the country. ""None of them has spoken and they will not speak because their intention is to send a message to the public that if you protest against us, we will run over you,"" Mr Sibal alleged. He also raised the concern about the treatment that Congress leaders received in Lakhimpur Kheri. Mr Sibal said, ""See the way they have treated Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Deepender Hooda. They have the right to go there. I congratulate them for the step, but the way they are being treated shows the symbol of arrogance."" As many as eight people died in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident on Sunday. Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of several farmer unions, alleged that Ashish Mishra Teni, son of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra Teni arrived with three vehicles around the time that farmers were dispersing from their protest at the helipad and mowed down farmers and towards the end also attacked SKM leader Tajinder Singh Virk directly, by trying to run a vehicle over him.   However, Ashish Mishra refuted SKM's allegations and said he was not present at the spot where the incident took place. Union Minister Ajay Mishra Teni also said that his son was not present at the spot, adding that some miscreants mingled with protesting farmers and pelted the stones at the car which lead to the 'unfortunate incident'."

Suu Kyi went on trial in June, four months after she was taken into custody in a coup that plunged the country into turmoil. The 76-year-old faces a raft of charges, from sedition to illegally importing walkie-talkies, which could see her jailed for decades. She applied for hearings to take place every two weeks instead of weekly ""on the grounds of her health,"" her lawyer Khin Maung Zaw said after her latest court appearance. After new corruption charges were brought against her last week, the Nobel laureate now must appear most weekdays at a courtroom in the military-built capital Naypyidaw. The trial had left Suu Kyi feeling ""strained"", Khin Maung Zaw said, without offering more details. He added that the judge would make a decision on her request next week. Eight months since the coup, clashes between junta forces and anti-coup dissidents have escalated, with increasingly bloody attacks and reprisals. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis, spearheaded by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), have failed to make headway. Brunei Second Foreign Minister Erywan Yusof, who was selected as the regional bloc's envoy in August after lengthy wrangling, had called for full access to all parties when he visits. But last week a junta spokesman told AFP it was unlikely he would be allowed to meet Suu Kyi.   Security forces have killed more than 1,100 civilians since the coup, according to a local monitoring group.

The bench of Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh sought the response of the Government of NCT Delhi and Centre through the Director-General, Directorate of Fire Services, Civil Defence and Home Guards and listed the matter for further hearing on November 29, 2021. The plea stated that section 6(2) of the act empowers the Controller of Civil Defence Corp to discharge any member without assigning any reason if they are of the opinion that continued presence of any member of the Corps is undesirable, and Section 14(1) of the act puts an absolute bar against availing judicial remedy against any order made in exercise of any power conferred by or under the act. The Petitioner Farukh Khan stated that he had served the Corps since 2014 and has completed various training courses during his tenure with the Civil Defence but on March 23, 2020, he was discharged from the membership of the Civil Defence Corps without assigning any reason, plea stated ""The appeal preferred against the discharge order was also rejected without assigning any reason,"" the plea stated. Petitioner sought court's direction to Delhi Government to reinstate him in call-out duty along with damages for loss of duty allowance with effect from the date of discharge. The plea stated that he was orally told by the Deputy Controller that an FIR has been registered against executives of JSM NGO under section 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) on March 23, 2020 and because the petitioner is a secretary of the said NGO, his continued presence in Civil Defence is undesirable. It is submitted that the said FIR was registered against NGO officials for opening their office during lockdown for distributing masks. It is also submitted that the Petitioner was neither present at the place of incidence nor he was named in the FIR. Petitioner's lawyer Rajiv Agarwal stated that section 6(2) of the act violates the right of the petitioner to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation as guaranteed under Article 19(g) of the Constitution of India. ""Section 6(2) of the Act excludes the application of the principle of natural justice without citing any exceptional circumstances for which the provision could be applied,"" the plea added.   The members of Civil Defence are being engaged by the government of NCT of Delhi to perform work of regular and perennial nature in its various offices. ""It is submitted that members of Civil Defence are being deployed in DM, SDM and Tehsildar offices to perform the works which are usually done by permanent government employees.

The Taliban overran Kabul seven weeks ago and have set up an interim Afghan government, but still face attacks from the regional branch of the Islamic State. The Taliban's chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said fighters carried out the operation in the north of Kabul on Sunday evening. ""As a result of the operation, which was very decisive and successful, the IS centre was completely destroyed and all the IS members in it were killed,"" Mujahid said on Twitter. Witnesses and AFP journalists heard blasts and gunfire in the capital at the time of the raid, and images posted to social media showed a large explosion and a fire at the scene. Kabul resident and government employee Abdul Rahaman told AFP that a ""large number"" of Taliban special forces attacked at least three houses in his neighbourhood. ""The fighting continued for several hours,"" he said, adding the sound of weapons kept him awake all night. ""They said they were after Daesh (ISIS) fighters in the area,"" Rahman said. ""I don't know how many were killed or arrested but the fighting was intense."" The operation took place within hours of a deadly attack targeting a prayer ceremony at the Eid Gah mosque in memory of Taliban spokesman Mujahid's mother, who died last week. A government cultural commission official, who asked not to be named, told AFP that five people died and 11 were wounded, adding the casualties included both civilians and Taliban members. ""We have also arrested three people in connection with the blast,"" he said. - Blood trails - According to the official, the device was placed at the entrance to the mosque and detonated as mourners were leaving after offering condolences to Mujahid and his family. A witness at the mosque, who asked not to be identified, told AFP that Sunday's attack at the entrance was carried out by a single suicide bomber. Just outside the eastern gate, a dark patch was visible on the ground where the explosion took place and bullet holes could be seen in a wall. The witness said a group of Taliban members -- including senior figures -- inside the mosque grounds came under fire after the blast, taking two casualties. He added that two Taliban units mistakenly opened fire on each other in the confusion following the explosion, but interior ministry spokesman Qari Sayed Khosti denied there had been any gunfire. ""A suicide bomber detonated his explosives among the crowd killing three people and wounding a dozen,"" he said. Trails of blood into the mosque, as well as two red pools where the witness said the injured fighters were treated inside, were seen by AFP reporters on Monday. On Monday, Mujahid told AFP that an investigation was still ongoing but ""initial information suggests that Daesh-linked groups may have carried out the attack"". The Taliban and the Afghanistan branch of ISIS -- or ISIS-K -- are both hardline Sunni Islamist terrorist groups.   But they differ on the issues of religion and strategy, which has led to bloody fighting between the two.

In a one-line statement, Congress said that it has suspended Mr Ahmed with immediate effect for repeatedly violating party discipline. The Congress had earlier served a show-cause notice to the three-time MLA from Baghbar for justifying the killing of eight people during an agitation in Darrang district in 1983. He called the eight people, seen as martyrs of agitation in the Assamese society, ""murderers"". Mr Ahmed apparently made the remarks while reacting to last month's eviction drive in the district that left two persons dead. The eviction drive was carried at four places in Dholpur, about 9 km from Sipajhar, on September 20, and nearly 800 families - most of whom were Bengali-speaking Muslims - were removed from 4,500 bighas of land the government claimed ownership for. His comment has evoked strong reactions across Assam and multiple FIRs have been filed against him. Mr Ahmed was later arrested from his official residence in Guwahati on October 2. In its show-cause notice, the Assam Congress has accused MLA Sherman Ali Ahmed of making ""politically motivated"" statements ""with the intention of damaging the party's image"" ahead of the bypolls in the state.   It also said that allegations are rife within the party and even outside that Ahmed is acting as an ""agent of the BJP"", and that due to his closeness to the chief minister, he is being sponsored to make such comments to cause harm to the Congress, especially during elections.

The hardline elimination policy had largely protected the country from the pandemic, with residents enjoying a near-normal domestic life alongside tight restrictions on international borders. But an August outbreak prompted a seven-week lockdown in its main population centre that has failed to curb infection rates. Ardern said the highly transmissible Delta variant had proved a ""game-changer"" that could not be eliminated. ""Even with the long-term restrictions we've had, we patently haven't reached zero,"" she added. Ardern said she would not immediately dump the elimination strategy but lockdown restrictions in Auckland would be eased slightly, even though new case numbers have not fallen. She added that the change -- a major shift to her previous goal of completely stamping out the virus -- was possible because vaccination rates had increased dramatically. ""Elimination was important because we didn't have vaccines, now we do, so we can begin to change the way we do things,"" she told reporters. Auckland will remain in lockdown for now but the government will conduct weekly reviews to time the reintroduction of freedoms. City residents can meet outdoors in groups of up to 10 from Wednesday and steps such as reopening shops and schools will be considered in the coming weeks. The rest of the country was allowed out of lockdown in early September. Before the Auckland outbreak, New Zealand's elimination strategy was widely lauded by bodies such at the World Health Organization, with just 27 deaths in a population of five million.   Opposition leader Judith Collins said Ardern had offered only a ""vague wishlist"" that failed to outline a coherent plan to replace the ""Covid zero"" approach.

621,Mon Oct 04 05:17:50 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: The Biggest Revelations From The Pandora Papers Leak https://t.co/h7rYkHVEfW https://t.co/qmVE3Zwvj7,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pandora-papers-leak-jordan-king-pandora-paper-leak-imran-khan-tony-blair-the-biggest-revelations-from-the-pandora-papers-leak-2562925,Pandora Papers Leak: The Biggest Reveals So Far,"An unprecedented leak of financial records known as the Pandora Papers has revealed the offshore financial assets of dozens of current and former world leaders and hundreds of politicians from Asia and the Middle East to Latin America. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists obtained 11.9 million confidential documents from 14 separate legal and financial services firms, which the group said offered ""a sweeping look at an industry that helps the world's ultrawealthy, powerful government officials and other elites conceal trillions of dollars from tax authorities, prosecutors and others."" Moving money through offshore accounts, in mostly low-tax jurisdictions, is legal in most countries, and many of the people named in the data release aren't accused of criminal wrongdoing. But the journalist group said the 2.94 terabytes of financial and legal data -- which makes this leak larger than the 2016 Panama papers release -- shows the ""offshore money machine operates in every corner of the planet, including the world's largest democracies,"" and involves some of the world's most well-known banks and legal firms. Here are some of the biggest revelations in the release: Jordan king's real estate empire Jordan's monarch, King Abdullah II, used an English accountant in Switzerland and lawyers in the British Virgin Islands to secretly purchase 14 luxury homes worth $106 million, including a $23 million property in California overlooking a beach, the ICIJ reported, noting the country relies on foreign aid to support its people and house millions of refugees. U.K. attorneys for the king told the ICIJ that he was not required to pay taxes under Jordanian law, has never misused public funds and has ""security and privacy reasons to hold property through offshore companies."" French Riviera estate Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who is currently running for re-election, ""moved $22 million through offshore companies to buy a lavish estate on the French Riviera in 2009 while keeping his ownership secret,"" ICIJ said. The five-bedroom Chateau Bigaud, which is owned by a subsidiary of one of Babis's Czech companies, sits on 9.4 acres (3.8 hectares) in a hilltop village where Pablo Picasso spent the last years of his life, the group said. The Queen and Azerbaijan The data release revealed that Azerbaijan's ruling Aliyev family traded around $540 million worth of U.K. property in recent years, reportedthe Guardian, one of the ICIJ's media partners. Queen Elizabeth II's crown estate bought one property worth almost $91 million from the family, and is currently in the middle of an internal review into the purchase, the Guardian said. ""Given the potential concerns raised, we are looking into the matter,"" a spokesperson for the crown estate told the paper, which added the Aliyevs declined to comment. South Dakota, Nevada havens One of the most ""troubling revelations"" for the U.S. was the role of South Dakota, Nevada and other states that have adopted financial secrecy laws that ""rival those of offshore jurisdictions"" and demonstrate America's ""expanding complicity in the offshore economy,"" said the Washington Post, one of the ICIJ's media partners. A former vice president of the Dominican Republic finalized several trusts in South Dakota to store his personal wealth and shares of one of the country's largest sugar producers, the paper said. Pakistan's political elite Several members of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan's inner circle, including current and former cabinet ministers, ""secretly owned an array of companies and trusts holding millions of dollars of hidden wealth,"" the group reported. That could create a political headache for the former cricket star, who campaigned for the South Asian country's highest office as the head of a reformist party that promised a strong anti-corruption agenda. Before the release of the Pandora papers, a Khan spokesperson told a news conference Khan had no offshore company, but ministers and advisers ""will have to be held accountable"" for their individual acts.   Tony Blair property purchase The documents show former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife saved around $422,000 by using an offshore company to purchase an almost $9 million office in London's Marylebone area that was partially owned by the family of a Bahraini minister, the Guardian reported. The paper said there was nothing illegal about the deal, but it ""highlights a loophole that has enabled wealthy property owners not to pay a tax that is commonplace for ordinary Britons."""
622,Mon Oct 04 05:17:49 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: Fumio Kishida Approved As Japan's Next Prime Minister https://t.co/pTl81s9a8Z https://t.co/o0DTZCfRmQ,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/japan-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-approved-as-japans-next-prime-minister-2562922,Fumio Kishida Approved As Japan's Next Prime Minister,"Japan's new prime minister Fumio Kishida unveiled his government on Monday, mixing holdovers with newcomers, after lawmakers voted him the new leader of the world's third-largest economy. The soft-spoken scion of a Hiroshima political family, 64-year-old Kishida beat popular vaccine chief Taro Kono to win the leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) last week. He easily won Monday's vote in parliament approving him as prime minister thanks to the party's commanding majority. Kishida bowed to his fellow lawmakers after the vote, but did not immediately speak. Earlier, he told reporters he was ready for the top job. ""I think it will be a new start in its true sense,"" he said. ""I want to take on challenges with a strong will and firm resolve to face the future."" Kishida is widely considered a safe pair of hands, who commands support from his own faction within the LDP and is not expected to veer significantly from the government's existing policies. His election came after former prime minister Yoshihide Suga, who submitted his resignation on Monday morning, announced he would not stand for the LDP leadership after just one year in office. Shortly after the parliament vote, Kishida's new cabinet was announced, with more than a dozen fresh faces but holdovers from the Suga government largely populating the most important portfolios. Both Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi will retain their jobs. Motegi is a Harvard-educated political veteran who has taken the lead in negotiating key trade deals, while Kishi is the brother of former prime minister Shinzo Abe. Fresh faces The finance portfolio will go to Shunichi Suzuki, who is replacing his own brother-in-law Taro Aso. Suzuki is also a veteran politician and the son of a former prime minister. He has served in government before, holding both the Olympics minister and environment minister posts. The cabinet includes three women, among them Kishida's one-time rival for the leadership, Seiko Noda, who was named minister in charge of addressing Japan's declining birthrate. The posts of vaccine minister and digital minister also went to women, with several members of the cabinet appointed to their first ministerial post. ""The Kishida cabinet aims at balance with consideration given to major factions, young lawmakers, and neighbouring countries,"" wrote Junichi Makino, SMBC Nikko Securities chief economist, in a note. ""It's the kind of cabinet formation that reflects Kishida, who works not to make enemies."" Kishida has also rewarded those who supported him in the leadership race, including rival Sanae Takaichi who backed him in the second-round vote against Kono, and has been made LDP policy chief. Kono meanwhile has been made party communications chairman -- something of a step down from his recent role heading the vaccine roll-out and past posts as defence and foreign minister. Election looms As prime minister, Kishida faces a raft of challenges, from the post-pandemic economic recovery to confronting military threats from North Korea and China. He will also lead the LDP in general elections, which local media reported would be held on October 31, a few weeks earlier than expected. The ruling party and its coalition are widely expected to retain power, but could be vulnerable to losing some seats, with the public unhappy about the government's response to the coronavirus. Suga's government saw its approval ratings slump as it struggled to tackle waves of infection, including a record virus spike over the summer while the Olympics were being held in Tokyo. Kishida's leadership campaign emphasised his plans to correct government missteps on the pandemic, including a pledge to unleash new economic stimulus. Much of Japan has been under virus emergency measures for a large part of the year, with the restrictions finally lifting last week as new infections decline.   More than 60 percent of the population is now fully vaccinated, but there are concerns that the healthcare system could easily become overwhelmed again in a new virus wave.

The global health agency Unitaid and its partners hope to reach an agreement as soon as next week to secure the first supplies of the antiviral treatment for lower- and middle-income nations, Philippe Duneton, its executive director, said in an interview. Unitaid has been in discussions with the company and generic manufacturers, he said. ""This is really what we've waited for all these months,"" he said. ""There is a window of hope with this treatment, and now we need to collectively make it work for people"" in less well-to-do countries. If the new medication hits the market, it could be a turning point in the pandemic, but the global supply picture is uncertain. On the vaccine front, lower-income nations have been left behind. About nine months after the arrival of Covid shots, more than 55 countries have yet to vaccinate 10% of their populations. More than two dozen nations are below 2%. The drug, known as molnupiravir, reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 50% in an interim analysis of a late-stage clinical trial, Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP said Friday. Seeking Clearance The results were so positive that Merck and Ridgeback -- in consultation with independent trial monitors and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration -- elected to stop enrolling patients and begin the process of gaining regulatory clearance. Merck plans to submit the data to other regulators worldwide. The company earlier this year announced that it had signed non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for the drug with five generic manufacturers in India in a bid to accelerate availability in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies. Merck said it expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by year-end, with more expected in 2022. In June, the company agreed to a $1.2 billion supply deal with the U.S. government, under which it would provide 1.7 million courses of the treatment. Initial production wouldn't go far given the number of worldwide Covid cases. But the drug potentially could be very cheap to manufacture, so it should be available at a low cost in developing nations, Andrew Hill, a senior research fellow at the University of Liverpool, wrote in an email. ""This could be a major advance in the treatment of Covid-19,"" he said. Tiered Pricing Merck said it plans to implement a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank income criteria to reflect countries' ability to finance their health response to the pandemic.   The drug could provide an important tool for the world on top of vaccines, but manufacturing will need to be expanded and more funding is required, according to Unitaid's Duneton said. ""What we need to do is to create an affordable but quality market of generics, exactly what we did for combating AIDS,"" he said. ""It's feasible, it can be done."""

We must consider stronger oversight."" In the ""60 Minutes"" interview Haugen explained how the company's News Feed algorithm is optimized for content that gets a reaction. The company's own research shows that it is ""easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions,"" Haugen said. ""Facebook has realized that if they change the algorithm to be safer, people will spend less time on the site, they'll click on less ads, they'll make less money."" During the 2020 US presidential election, she said, the company realized the danger that such content presented and turned on safety systems to reduce it. But ""as soon as the election was over they turn them back off, or they change the settings back to what they were before, to prioritize growth over safety, and that really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me,"" she said. ""No one at Facebook is malevolent,"" she said, adding that co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg did not set out to make a ""hateful"" platform. But, Haugen said, the incentives are ""misaligned."" 'Ludicrous' Facebook's vice president of policy and global affairs Nick Clegg vehemently pushed back at the assertion its platforms are ""toxic"" for teens, days after a tense congressional hearing in which US lawmakers grilled the company over its impact on the mental health of young users. While Haugen did not draw a straight line between the decision to roll back safety systems and the US Capitol riot on January 6, ""60 Minutes"" noted that the social network was used by some of the organizers of that violence. During an appearance on CNN, Clegg dismissed the link. ""I think the assertion (that) January 6th can be explained because of social media, I just think that's ludicrous,"" Clegg told the broadcaster, saying it was ""false comfort"" to believe technology was driving America's deepening political polarization. Polarization The New York Times reported Saturday that Clegg sought to pre-empt Haugen's interview by penning a 1,500-word memo to staff alerting them of the ""misleading"" accusations. Facebook has encountered criticism that it fuels societal problems, attacks Clegg said should not rest at Facebook's feet. But he acknowledged that people with pre-existing issues may not benefit from social media use. He also disputed reporting in an explosive Wall Street Journal series that Facebook's own research warned of the harm that photo-sharing app Instagram can do to teen girls' well-being. ""It's simply not borne out by our research or anybody else's that Instagram is bad or toxic for all teens,"" Clegg told CNN, but added Facebook's research would continue.   Facing pressure, the company had previously announced it would suspend but not abandon the development of a version of Instagram meant for users younger than 13.

The company's stock price has plunged around 80 percent since the start of the year as it teeters on the brink of collapse while struggling under a mountain of debt. ""Trading in the shares of China Evergrande Group will be halted,"" it said in a statement to the exchange. ""Accordingly, all structured products relating to the Company will also be halted from trading at the same time."" Shares in its electric vehicle company, which last week scrapped a proposed Shanghai listing, were not suspended, though they fell six percent in early trade. Officials at the firm have been struggling to deal with a crisis that has left it more than $300 billion in debt, fuelling fears of a contagion for the wider Chinese economy that some warn could spread globally. Last week it said it will sell a $1.5 billion stake in a regional Chinese bank to raise much-needed capital, as it struggles to make interest payments to bondholders. Beijing has stayed silent on the travails of the property empire, but state media has trailed various responses in a nod to the mood towards a private company that grew on a debt binge in the boom years of Chinese real estate. Authorities have asked local governments to prepare for Evergrande's potential collapse, according to reports, suggesting a major state bailout is unlikely. The liquidity crunch has triggered public anger and rare protests outside its offices in China as investors and suppliers demand their money back. The group has admitted to facing ""unprecedented challenges"" and warned that it may not be able to meet its liabilities.   The country's real estate sector has been under tightened scrutiny in recent months, with regulators announcing caps for three different debt ratios in a scheme dubbed ""three red lines"" last year.

The farmers, who had assembled to stop the visit of the Union Minister and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, said the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri district started after the minister's car mowed down the protesters. Visuals from the area showed arson and vehicles set on fire. The Congress tweeted a video saying Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is being taken to Sitapur Police line and urged people to gather there. ""I am not important than the people you have killed. The government you are defending. You give me a legal warrant, a legal basis or else I will not move from here and you won't touch me,"" a visibly agitated Congress leader, surrounded by policemen, is heard saying in a video when her convoy is stopped at Sitapur.

And the charge will not be against the police but you,"" she is heard telling the cop. At this point Congress leader Deepender Hooda, who is standing next to her, questions the policeman as to how could he raise his hand against Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. It is not clear what really happened or if the Congress leader was hit. ""I am going to testify. I have seen it,"" says Mr Hooda, before he is pushed back by a cop and moved to a waiting car.

""You can't speak to a woman but are hitting him,"" intervenes Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and stands in between Mr Hooda and the group of policemen. She then asks them to produce a warrant or an order that gives them the power to stop their convoy. Rahul Gandhi tweeted in support of sister Priyanka Gandhi, underscoring that they will make farmers win.   ""Priyanka, I know you won't back away - they are stunned by your courage.

The two sides resumed communications with officials exchanging their first phone call since August, days after the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting over the North Korean missile tests. The two Koreas had signalled a surprise thaw in relations in late July by announcing the resumption of cross-border communications -- severed more than a year earlier -- but the detente was short-lived, as Pyongyang stopped answering calls just two weeks later. Seoul's unification ministry confirmed the phone call on Monday morning between officials from the two rivals. ""It's been a while and I'm very happy that the communication line has been restored,"" a South Korean official told his northern counterpart in footage provided to reporters by the ministry. The South's defence ministry also confirmed that cross-border military communications have resumed. ""With the restoration of the South-North communication line, the government evaluates that a foundation for recovering inter-Korean relations has been provided,"" the unification ministry said in a statement. ""The government hopes... to swiftly resume dialogue and begin practical discussions for recovering inter-Korean relations."" Earlier on Monday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had ""expressed the intention of restoring the cut-off north-south communication lines"", North Korea's official news agency KCNA said. It reported that the move was an attempt to establish ""lasting peace"" on the Korean peninsula. But an analyst played down Monday's restoration as a ""symbolic"" gesture, noting the North's recent missile launches. ""Even if this leads to talks, we may enter a new phase where North Korea engages in dialogue but continues to carry out provocations simultaneously,"" said Park Won-gon, a professor of North Korean Studies at Ewha Womans University. - Ignoring calls - North Korea had unilaterally cut off all official military and political communication links in June last year over activists sending anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border. The two sides said on July 27 this year that all lines were restored. Their joint announcement, which coincided with the anniversary of the end of the Korean War, was the first positive development since a series of summits between Kim and the South's President Moon Jae-in in 2018 failed to achieve any significant breakthrough. They also revealed at the time that Kim and Moon had exchanged a series of letters since April in which they agreed that re-establishing hotlines would be a productive first step in rebooting relations between the two rivals which, despite the end of their 1950-53 conflict, remain technically at war. But the cross-border communication lasted for just two weeks, with the North dropping them in protest at joint US-South Korea military drills. In the period since, Pyongyang has held a series of tension-raising missile tests. In September, it launched what it said was a long-range cruise missile, and earlier this week it tested what it described as a hypersonic gliding vehicle, which South Korea's military said appeared to be in the early stages of development. On Friday, it said it had successfully fired a new anti-aircraft missile.   Pyongyang slammed the UN Security Council Sunday for holding an emergency meeting over the missile tests, accusing member states of toying with a ""time-bomb"".

The news of Carrick's arrest was announced as the government and the police are still trying to deal with the fallout from the conviction of 48-year-old Wayne Couzens. Couzens was jailed Thursday for the rest of his life after falsely arresting Sarah Everard on the pretence she had broken coronavirus restrictions, then raping and murdering her.

The documents revealed on Sunday more than 700 Pakistani names. Among those whose holdings have been exposed are Khan's finance minister, Shaukat Fayaz Ahmed Tarin, and his family, and the son of Khan's former adviser for finance and revenue, Waqar Masood Khan.  The records also reveal the offshore dealings of a top PTI donor, Arif Naqvi, who is facing fraud charges in the US, according to ICIJ. Pakistan's civilian government and military leaders who have been hiding vast amounts of wealth in a country plagued by widespread poverty and tax avoidance, said ICIJ. According to ARY News, ""the owner of two offshore companies registered at a similar address as of Prime Minister Imran Khan has revealed that they were registered by him on a different address and denied any role of the premier in this regard."" According to the ICIJ, Pakistan''s elites use of offshore services that rivals the findings of the Panama Papers, which led to Sharif''s downfall and helped propel Imran Khan to power three years ago. The revelations are part of the Pandora Papers, a new global investigation into the shadowy offshore financial system that allows multinational corporations, the rich, famous and powerful to avoid taxes and otherwise shield their wealth. The probe is based on more than 11.9 million confidential files from 14 offshore services firms leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with 150 news organisations around the world, according to ICIJ. In 2007, Pakistani General Shafaat Ullah Shah''s wife acquired a $1.2 million apartment in London through a discreet offshore transaction. Notably, he had been a close aide of then-president Pervez Musharraf. The document has also revealed many key military leaders of Pakistan and intergenerational wealth transfer. The findings offer a portrait of an unaccountable military elite with extensive personal and family offshore holdings. Pakistan Prime Minister is surrounded with people - cabinet ministers and their families, donors and other political allies - who have holdings hidden offshore, according to ICIJ. Pakistan's Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin and some members of his family own four offshore companies. Omer Bakhtyar, the brother of Khan's minister for industries, Makhdum Khusro Bakhtyar, transferred a $1 million apartment in the Chelsea area of London to his elderly mother through an offshore company in 2018, as per ICIJ. Faisal Vawda, Khan''s former minister for water resources set up an offshore company in 2012 to invest in UK properties. He resigned in March amid a controversy over his status as a dual US-Pakistan national. The financial backers of Imran Khan are prominent in leaked documents, according to ICIJ. The files detail the offshore activities of more than 29,000 accounts. Among them: More than 130 Forbes list billionaires and over 330 public officials around the globe. The Pandora Papers expose the ill-gotten wealth of elites, accumulated through tax evasion & corruption & laundered out to financial ""havens"".

The world's largest social media platform has been embroiled in a firestorm brought about by an unnamed whistleblower, who has shared a trove of company documents with lawmakers and The Wall Street Journal that detail how Facebook knew its products, including Instagram, were harming girls' self-image. The uproar was likely to continue late Sunday with the appearance of an unnamed whistleblower on news show ""60 Minutes"" to discuss accusations that Facebook relaxed its security safeguards after the 2020 election in a move that led it to be used by Donald Trump supporters storming the Capitol.  The New York Times reported Saturday that Clegg sought to pre-empt the whistleblower by penning a 1,500 word memo to staff alerting them of the ""misleading"" accusations. Clegg pressed the case in an appearance on CNN. ""I think the assertion (that) January 6th can be explained because of social media, I just think that's ludicrous,"" Clegg told the broadcaster, saying it was ""false comfort"" to believe technology was driving America's deepening political polarization. The responsibility for the insurrection ""lies squarely with the people who inflicted the violence and those who encouraged them -- including then-president Trump"" and others who asserted the election was stolen, he added. Polarization According to the Times, Clegg in his internal memo wrote that the whistleblower will insist the problems stemmed from Facebook's 2018 decision to change its News Feed to emphasize what it calls ""Meaningful Social Interactions."" While everyone ""has a rogue uncle"" or old classmate whose extreme views may be visible on Facebook, Clegg reportedly wrote, ""changes to algorithmic ranking systems on one social media platform cannot explain wider societal polarization."" Facebook has encountered criticism that it fuels societal problems, attacks Clegg said should not rest at Facebook's feet. But he acknowledged that people with pre-existing issues may not benefit from social media use. ""I don't think it's intuitively surprising if you're not feeling great about yourself already, that then going on to social media can actually make you feel a bit worse,"" he told CNN.   He also disputed reporting in an explosive Wall Street Journal series that Facebook's own research warned of the harm that photo-sharing app Instagram can do to teen girls' well-being. ""It's simply not borne out by our research or anybody else's that Instagram is bad or toxic for all teens,"" Clegg said, but added Facebook's research will continue."

Gen Rawat's visit to the US took place a week after the maiden in-person meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden at the White House during which both leaders reaffirmed the need for greater military-to-military cooperation between India and the US. ""It was an honour to meet Indian Chief of Defence Staff Gen Rawat during his historic visit to the Pentagon last week,"" Austin said. ""We reaffirmed our enduring commitment to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific and discussed ways to drive greater interoperability between the US and Indian armed forces,"" Austin said in a tweet, amidst China's aggressive actions in the region. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said that Gen Rawat and Austin exchanged views on priorities for advancing the US-India defence partnership, including through enhanced cooperation in new defence domains such as space, cyber, and emerging technologies. ""Austin underscored the US commitment to supporting the Indian Armed Forces' transition toward greater institutional integration and operational jointness. They also discussed opportunities for expanding multilateral cooperation with regional partners,"" he said. ""This historic meeting highlights the enduring strength of the US-India Major Defence Partnership as the two countries work in concert with like-minded partners to sustain a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" Kirby said. On September 24, President Biden hosted the first-ever in-person summit of Quad leaders that vowed to strive for an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, inclusive, anchored by democratic values and unconstrained by coercion, sending an apparent message to China. At the invitation of President Biden, Prime Minister Modi and his counterparts Scott Morrison from Australia and Yoshihide Suga from Japan attended the Quad summit. India, the US and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military manoeuvring in the resource-rich region. China claims nearly all of the disputed South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam all claim parts of it. Beijing has built artificial islands and military installations in the South China Sea. China also has territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea.   During his visit to the Pentagon, Gen Rawat also met his US counterpart Gen Mark Milley and they discussed a range of issues, including ways to ensure regional security and their respective roles as principal military advisors to the civilian leadership.

A special investigation team (SIT) probing the matter has found 26 officials of the NOIDA guilty in the case of which 20 have retired, two have died and four are still serving, the statement read. ""Of the four serving officials, one has already been suspended from work. Three other serving officers have been suspended and a departmental inquiry is being initiated against them. Order has been issued for action against retired officials also as per procedure,"" the statement read. The Supreme Court had on August 31 issued directions for demolition of realty group Supertech's twin 40-storey towers under construction in Noida Sector 93A within three months for violation of building norms in ""collusion"" with district officials, holding that illegal construction has to be dealt with strictly to ensure compliance with the rule of law. After the top court's rapping to NOIDA, an industrial development body under the UP government, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had also ordered an inquiry into the matter and called for strict action against those guilty following which an SIT was formed on September 2. On the basis of the SIT's report, the UP government on Sunday said it has directed that an FIR be lodged with the state vigilance commission against officials of the NOIDA, four directors and two architects of Supretech Limited involved in the case, according to the statement. Instructions have also been given to file a case against officials of NOIDA and the Supertech group involved in the matter for violation of the UP Industrial Development Act 1976 and the UP Apartment (Promotion of Construction, Ownership and Maintenance) in a competent court after obtaining approval from competent authorities, it stated. ""Since the SIT has found involvement of two architecture firms also in the case, instructions have been issued that the Council of Archicture be informed about the involvement of these firms without any delay for appropriate action against them,"" the statement read. The SIT has reported that the Supretech group encroached a ""green belt"" which was part of the layout plan, measuring 7,000 sq metres as ""land plots"", for which a departmental inquiry against NOIDA officials is already in progress. Hence, an order has been issued to ensure that action is taken against the officials concerned and the encroachment from the green belt is cleared within the next 15 days, it added. The four-member SIT was formed in September to probe the matter, fix responsibility of officials and it was given a week's time to submit its report. The SIT had sought time extension to complete the probe. The case pertained to Supertech illegally constructing two 40-storey towers, with over 900 flats and 21 shops, in its Emerald Court housing project premises.   Residents of the housing project claimed their consent was not taken for the twin towers which were being built in violation of norms, and moved court. The Allahabad High Court had in 2014 ordered demolition of the twin towers with the Supreme Court upholding the verdict in 2021."

Mr Rashid's remarks came after Prime Minister Imran Khan in an interview with Turkish government-owned TRT World news channel revealed that his government was in talks with the TTP with the help of the Taliban in Afghanistan, drawing criticism from politicians and victims of terrorism. The TTP, commonly known as the Pakistani Taliban, is a banned terrorist organisation based along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Defending the government's move, the minister said the offer was not for militants who were responsible for bloodshed in the country, including the December 2014 massacre in the Army Public School (APS) in Peshawar which left over 150 people dead, Dawn newspaper reported. “We know very well who's good and who's bad. Anyone who thinks we are not aware of that, he's mistaken, he doesn't have sense,” he said. The offer of talks was only for “good Taliban” and negotiations on this were taking place at the “highest-level,"" he said. He maintained that it was not appropriate to fight with those who have surrendered to adopt peaceful lives. “The case of those who were involved in incidents like the APS is different. And the case of those who left the country for different reasons is different,” he said on Friday while responding to a question about the merit and mechanism of talks with the TTP. “We are not surrendering to anyone and this process is at a very early phase. No one needs to jump to conclusions at this stage.” Prime Minister Khan on Friday offered amnesty to the TTP provided the militant organisation lay down arms, disclosing that the government was holding talks with some groups of the outfit seeking reconciliation. The disclosure attracted a strong reaction, mainly from the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which questioned the move to hold negotiations with the TTP without taking Parliament into confidence, arguing that it would only add to the pain and grief of the families of the martyrs.   The TTP has been involved in various attacks in Pakistan for more than a decade which killed thousands of people. The government is now trying to use the influence of the Afghan Taliban over the TTP to reach a peace deal and end violence.

This is the first time Delhi will get funds under NCAP, a national-level strategy for a 20 to 30 per cent reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 concentration by 2024, with 2017 as the base year for comparison. ""Delhi will get ₹ 18.74 crore under NCAP. This is the first time it will be receiving funds under the programme since it started in 2019,"" an official told PTI. NCAP covers 132 non-attainment cities which do not meet the prescribed national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). These cities have been identified based on the ambient air quality data obtained during the 2011-2015 period under the National Air Monitoring Programme. The acceptable annual standard for PM 10 and PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre and 40 micrograms per cubic metre respectively. In 2017, Delhi's annual PM10 average stood at 240 micrograms per cubic metre. The targeted PM10 concentration by 2024 is 168 micrograms per cubic metre. ""The national capital did not get any funds under NCAP for two years because it had other resources available -- a green cess levied on diesel vehicles above 2,000 cc -- which is deposited with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and a pollution tax on commercial vehicles entering Delhi,"" an official in the Union Environment Ministry said. This time, fund availability under NCAP has improved. ""Fifty cities are already getting a good amount (Rs 4,400 in 2020-21 and ₹ 2,217 crore in 2021-22) for pollution management from the Finance Commission. Therefore, the availability of funds for the remaining 82 cities under NCAP has improved. So, we decided to give some funds to Delhi, too,"" the official said. A total of ₹ 290 crore is available for these 82 cities this year. The NCAP fund will be utilised to cater to critical gaps -- wherever there is any inadequacy of funds available from other resources. The rest of the funding is to be mobilised through convergence of schemes, the official explained. Funds for bigger projects such as management of construction and demolition waste are allocated under the Swachh Bharat Urban programme and other schemes of the central government. The Delhi government has prepared a ""Winter Action Plan"" to tackle air pollution in the capital and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is expected to announce it soon.   The plan focuses on 10 key issues, including stubble burning, pollution hotspots, working of smog tower and vehicular and dust pollution.

The crowd, made up only of men and boys, listened to speeches by leading Taliban officials at Kohdaman township in the hilly outskirts of the capital. The rally was the first of its kind in the capital since the group seized control of the country seven weeks ago following a lightning offensive. Flanked by white and black Taliban standards, and members in full combat gear carrying assault rifles, the speakers addressed an audience that sat in rows of chairs under awnings. To kick off proceedings, a procession of Taliban personnel carrying flags and weapons -- including rocket launchers -- paraded around the crowd. Some of the mainly unarmed supporters waved homemade posters, while others sported red or white Taliban headbands. Tribal elders watched on cross-legged from the side of the stage. As people started arriving, music celebrating the Taliban's actions echoed around the site as dozens of heavily armed Taliban personnel in military combat fatigues stood guard. ""America is defeated, impossible, impossible -- but possible!"" one song said. Some chanted pro-Taliban slogans as they were driven down the dusty road on pick-up trucks to the site, as others shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) when they walked into the shaded area in front of the stage. Women's Protests At the turn-off towards the township, about 10 armed Taliban personnel lined the road beneath a large banner honouring a dead Taliban member and professing the ""support of the people of Kohdaman for the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in the action of liberating the country"". Last Thursday, the Taliban had violently cracked down on a small women's rights demonstration in eastern Kabul, firing shots into the air to disperse protesters. Then, gunmen pushed back the women protesters as they tried to continue with the demonstration, while a foreign journalist was hit with a rifle and blocked from filming. A Taliban terrorist released a brief burst of gunfire into the air with his automatic weapon, AFP journalists saw. Isolated anti-Taliban rallies -- with women at the forefront -- were staged in cities around the country after the group seized power, including in the western city of Herat where two people were shot dead.   But protests have dwindled since the government issued an order banning demonstrations that did not have prior authorisation, warning of ""severe legal action"" for violators. The handful that have gone ahead have been criticised as carefully orchestrated publicity stunts, including a rally at a Kabul university where hundreds of fully veiled women professed support for the new regime."

The commission's research uncovered between 2,900 and 3,200 paedophile priests or other members of the church, said Jean-Marc Sauve, adding that it was ""a minimum estimate"". The commission's report is due to be released on Tuesday after two and a half years of research based on church, court and police archives, as well as interviews with witnesses. Sauve, a senior French civil servant, said the report, which runs to 2,500 pages, had attempted to quantify both the number of offenders and the number of victims. It also looked into ""the mechanisms, notably institutional and cultural ones"" within the Church which allowed paedophiles to remain, and will offer 45 proposals. The independent commission was set up in 2018 by the Bishops' Conference of France (CEF) in response to a number of scandals that shook the Church in France and worldwide. Its formation also came after Pope Francis passed a landmark measure obliging those who know about sex abuse in the Catholic Church to report it to their superiors. Made up of 22 legal professionals, doctors, historians, sociologists and theologians, its brief was to investigate allegations of child sex abuse by clerics dating back to the 1950s. When it began its work it called for witness statements and set up a telephone hotline, then reported receiving thousands of messages in the months that followed. 'A Bomb' The report will be delivered to the CEF and released at a press conference Tuesday to which representatives of victims' associations are invited. ""It will be an explosion,"" one member of the commission told AFP on condition of anonymity."" ""It will have the effect of a bomb"", added Olivier Savignac, of the victim's association Parler et Revivre. Bishop Eric de Moulins-Beaufort, the president of the CEF, said he feared that the report would unveil ""significant and frightening figures"", during a meeting with parishioners from his diocese. A message from Church authorities to priests and parishes for weekend masses warned that the report's publication would be ""a harsh and serious moment"", which calls for ""an attitude of truth and compassion"". Sauve had said in November that the handling of suspected paedophile cases ""in the past has often been faulty"".   He said it was ""extremely serious that there could have been some institutions and some communities, in small number, where systemic abuses could have been committed"".

The so-called ""Pandora Papers"" investigation -- involving some 600 journalists from media including The Washington Post, the BBC and The Guardian -- is based on the leak of some 11.9 million documents from 14 financial services companies around the world. Some 35 current and former leaders are featured in the documents analyzed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) -- facing allegations ranging from corruption to money laundering and global tax avoidance. The documents notably expose how King Abdullah II created a network of offshore companies and tax havens to amass a $100 million property empire from Malibu, California to Washington and London. The BBC cited lawyers for King Abdullah saying all the properties were bought with personal wealth, and that it was common practice for high profile individuals to purchase properties via offshore companies for privacy and security reasons. The documents also show Czech Prime minister Andrej Babis -- facing an election later this week -- failed to declare an offshore investment company used to purchase a chateau worth $22 million in the south of France. In total, the ICIJ found links between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials, including country leaders, cabinet ministers, ambassadors and others. More than two-thirds of the companies were set up in the British Virgin Islands. In most countries, the ICIJ stresses, it is not illegal to have assets offshore or to use shell companies to do business across national borders. But such revelations are no less of an embarrassment for leaders who may have campaigned publicly against corruption, or advocated austerity measures at home. Among the other revelations from the ICIJ investigation: -- Family and associates of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev are alleged to have been secretly involved in property deals in Britain worth hundreds of millions. -- Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and six family members are alleged to secretly own a network of offshore companies. -- Members of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's inner circle, including cabinet ministers and their families, are said to secretly own companies and trusts holding millions of dollars. -- Russian President Vladimir Putin is not directly named in the files, but he is linked via associates to secret assets in Monaco. The ""Pandora Papers"" are the latest in a series of mass ICIJ leaks of financial documents that started with LuxLeaks in 2014, and was followed by the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers and FinCen.   The documents behind the latest investigation are drawn from financial services companies in countries including the British Virgin Islands, Panama, Belize, Cyprus, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Switzerland.

Mr Maharathy was declared the winner in the by-election, polling for which was held on September 30, the returning officer said. While the BJD candidate secured 96,972 votes, the BJP nominee got 76,056 votes. Congress candidate Biswokeshan Harichandan Mohapatra, who managed only 4,261 votes, lost his security deposit in the by-poll contested by a total of 10 candidates, the EC said. The by-election was necessitated following the death of sitting BJD MLA Pradeep Maharathy in October last year. Taking to Twitter, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik wrote in Odia: ""I thank the people of Pipili from the core of my heart for giving massive support to BJD candidate Rudra Pratap Maharathy. I also congratulate all the party workers and leaders. BJD is yours. We are always dedicated to serving the people."" EC sources said 1,80,037 votes were polled through EVMs, and another 893 votes were cast through postal ballots. As many as 831 people cast their votes under NOTA. While the BJD secured 53.6 per cent votes, the BJD got 42 per cent and the Congress 2.4 per cent, of the 1,80,930 votes polled through EVMs and postal ballots. Meanwhile, BJP state unit president Samir Mohanty thanked the people of Pipili for having faith in the party even as its candidate lost the elections. In a statement, Mr Mohanty said more voters have this time exercised their franchise in favour of the BJP candidate in comparison to the previous election in 2019. The Congress, accepting defeat, said, the party reiterates its commitment to fight for the interests of the people. Rudra Pratap Maharathy won the seat with a bigger margin than his father Pradeep Maharathy's 15,787 vote difference in the 2019 general elections in Pipili. Pradeep Maharathy had also defeated the same BJP candidate Ashrit Pattnaik. Incidentally, Rudra Pratap Maharathy's victory came on the day of his father's first death anniversary. ""The voters are my 'malik' (master) and I am their 'sevak' (servant). As I have mentioned earlier, I am here to serve the people of Pipili. Whether I am elected as the MLA or not, I would have stood by them always,"" Mr Maharathy, 32, said. He said the people of the Pipili-Delang area had been anxiously waiting for their representative in the assembly for a year.   With the victory in Pipili, the BJD's winning spree continued following the triumphs in the by-polls held at Bijepur, Balasore and Tirtol, after the 2019 general elections. The by-election results will certainly have a positive impact on the ensuing panchayat polls, said BJD vice-president Debi Prasad Mishra."

""It's evident that the world, the international community, rejects such behaviors by China more and more,"" Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters on Saturday. Democratic Taiwan's 23 million people live under the constant threat of invasion by China, which views the island as its territory and has vowed to one day seize it, by force if necessary. Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taipei since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, who has said she views the island as ""already independent"" and not part of a ""one China."" Under President Xi Jinping, Chinese warplanes are crossing into Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on a near daily basis. In the last two years, Beijing has begun sending large sorties into Taiwan's ADIZ to signal dissatisfaction at key moments -- and to keep Taipei's ageing fighter fleet regularly stressed. Xi has described Taiwan becoming part of the mainland as ""inevitable."" US military officials have begun to talk openly about fears that China could consider the previously unthinkable and invade. Protection of Taiwan has become a rare bipartisan issue in Washington and a growing number of Western nations have begun joining the United States in ""freedom of navigation"" exercises to push back on China's claims to the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. Price reiterated that the United States would ""continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability.""   ""The US commitment to Taiwan is rock solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,"" he said.

The video, in circulation on social media and cited by the Congress, shows Mr Khattar speaking of raising volunteer groups, which, he said, can administer ""tit for tat"" treatment. The Chief Minister's Office said the statement has been ""spread after cutting it in half"". ""If you watch this full video, you will understand what he said. During an internal meeting of BJP workers, the Chief Minister has talked about the workers being in discipline and strongly opposed to any wrongdoing. The Chief Minister said that work has to be done with zeal, keeping consciousness and discipline,"" the statement in Hindi read. ""There are some new farm groups which have emerged recently. We have to support them,"" Mr Khattar is heard saying in the video. ""In the north and west Haryana, farmers should raise armed groups... Raise volunteer groups of 500-700-1000 people and pick up sticks and then follow a 'tit for tat' policy... Don't bother about the consequences and if you go behind the bars for this then don't worry about getting bail. You will come out a big leader,"" he added. The Chief Minister was addressing members of the BJP's farmers' wing who had come to his official residence to thank him for getting the grain procurement started which was postponed till October 11. The pushback came immediately came from Congress's Randeep Surjewala. ""Your guru mantra of instigating BJP supporters to attack the protesting farmers with sticks, go to jail and then make them leaders will never be successful. This call to spread anarchy at an open programme by taking oath of the constitution is treason. It appears that Modi-Nadda ji are in agreement (with you),"" read a rough translation of a Hindi tweet from Mr Surjewala. The last use of force on farmers by the Haryana police took place on August 28. Around 10 people were injured as the Haryana police lathi-charged farmers who blocked a highway while on way to Karnal to protest against a BJP meeting attended by Chief Minister. The repercussions carried on well into last month, with furious farmers demanding action against Ayush Sinha - an IAS officer seen directing the police to ""break the heads"" of farmers.   Mr Khattar had defended the officer - saying at a press conference that although his ""choice of words was not correct, strictness had to be maintained to keep the law and order situation under control"". In November last year, farmers coming to Delhi for the ongoing indefinite protest, had to face batons, tear gas, water cannons and barricades in Haryana."

Hours later, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi reminded that the names of 10 police officers have already been sent to the Centre. He asserted that a ""good"" officer will be appointed as the director general of police (DGP) after consulting Mr Sidhu, ministers and MLAs once the state government receives three shortlisted names from the Centre. ""Demand for Justice in Sacrilege cases and for arrest of main culprits behind the drug trade brought our Govt in 2017 & Due to his failure, People removed the last CM. Now, AG/DG appointments rub salt on wounds of victims, they must be replaced or we will have No face!! (sic),"" Mr Sidhu said in a tweet. The development comes three days after Mr Sidhu and Mr Channi held a meeting, following which it was decided to set up a coordination panel for prior consultation on all major decisions of the state government. Talking to reporters in Morinda on the sidelines of a government function, Mr Channi said a regular DGP is yet to be appointed when he was asked about Mr Sidhu's demand for changing the state police chief and the advocate general. ""I have told Sidhu sahab and he also knows that the names of the police officers who have completed 30 years in service have been sent to the Centre for the appointment of a DGP. ""We have sent the names and the Centre will now send us a three-member panel (for the selection of a regular DGP),"" he said. The state government has sent the names of 10 police officers to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for the appointment of a regular DGP. After considering their service records and other necessary requirements, the UPSC will send the names of three officers to the state government, which will then select one of them for the post. To a question, Mr Channi said his government will take everyone along and perform with honesty. ""The party work is being looked after by Sidhu sahab. We should both work in coordination and we are doing so. If anything is not being liked, then we have set up a coordination committee at the party forum where we can discuss it,"" he added. A miffed Mr Sidhu, who resigned as the Punjab Congress chief a few days ago, had raised a question over the appointments of the DGP, the advocate general and ""tainted"" leaders as ministers. He has been seeking the removal of senior IPS officer Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, who was given the additional charge of DGP in Punjab after the previous state police chief, Dinkar Gupta, proceeded on leave. Mr Sahota was the head of the special investigation team (SIT) formed in 2015 by the then Akali-BJP government to probe sacrilege incidents in the state. Mr Sidhu attacked Sahota on Thursday, alleging that he wrongly indicted two Sikh men in a desecration case and gave a clean chit to the members of the Badal family. The cricketer-turned-politician has also been raising questions over the appointment of A S Deol as the state's new advocate general. Mr Deol was the counsel for former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in 2015 post the police firing in the wake of incidents of sacrilege. On Saturday, Mr Sidhu had said he would stand with Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra whether he holds any post or not. ""Will uphold principles of Gandhi Ji & Shastri Ji...Post or No Post will stand by @RahulGandhi & @priyankagandhi! Let all negative forces try to defeat me, but with every ounce of positive energy will make Punjab win, Punjabiyat (Universal Brotherhood) win & every Punjabi win!! (sic),"" he had tweeted on the birth anniversaries of Mahatma Gandhi and former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. Mr Sidhu's abrupt resignation has triggered a fresh turmoil in the Punjab Congress.   The Congress replaced Amarinder Singh as the Punjab chief minister with Mr Channi following a bitter power tussle between Mr Sidhu and Mr Singh.

Ms Banerjee's remarks came a short while before the election commission announced her massive victory in the Bhabanipur Assembly constituency. ""Since the elections started in West Bengal, central government hatched conspiracies to remove us (from power). I was hurt in my feet so that I don't contest the polls.

She further claimed that she had won the election by a margin of 58,832 votes and registered the victory in every ward of the constituency. In the Bhabanipur Assembly bypoll, Ms Banerjee marked a resounding victory as she recorded a margin of over 58,000 votes against her nearest rival Priyanka Tibrewal of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).   The victory reinstated Banerjee as a member of the state Legislative Assembly allowing her to continue as West Bengal chief minister.

In an interview with ANI, Dr Arora said, ""We are going to prioritise COVID-19 vaccination for children with severe comorbidities and comorbidities so that we immediately immunise them and rest of the children who are healthy can be immunised subsequently."" While speaking on how to prioritise the vaccination for children, Dr Arora said, ""We are working on that and we are trying to identify those who are at highest risk of getting the severe disease and the need for hospitalisation. Within the next couple of weeks, the list will be available in the public domain. In addition, we are also making arrangements at different parts of the country so that these children do not have to travel and within their district, the vaccine is made available."" Earlier in August, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had approved Zydus Cadila's DNA vaccine for emergency use in adults and children aged 12 years and above. Now, the vaccines are waiting to be introduced in the national vaccination programme. In the month of June, WHO-AIIMS in a joint survey found out that seroprevalence was 55.7 per cent in the age group below 18 years and 63.5 per cent in 18 years and above. Further, the study noticed that there was no statistically significant difference in prevalence between adults and children. Earlier in September, schools in the national capital for classes 9 to 12 re-opened after a prolonged closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of school reopening, Dr Arora said, ""Children are vectors. They spread the infection but they themselves do not get infected. So it is important that adults who are surrounding them - be it family members, teachers, non-teaching staff - they need to be immunised and surrounded by a ring of protection."" In addition, he stated, ""Our national target is to immunise all adults. We have reached half the landmark. Once adults are immunised we have about 44 crore children below 18 years of age and we are prepared for giving immunisation to children at the same speed."" According to Dr Arora, seropositivity results are showing an almost similar level of exposure to the virus, however, the disease symptomatic infection or severe disease is very uncommon in children, particularly below 10 years. ""In fact, there are some estimation that as compared to those who are above 18 years of age, the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death is almost 1/15th of those who are older than adults,"" Dr Arora noted. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a press briefing stated that Zydus Cadila's COVID-19 vaccine will soon be introduced in the national vaccination programme. ZyCoV-D is a needle-free vaccine manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila. Till date, this is the only vaccine that has received Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) for inoculating children between 12 and 18 years of age group.   ""In addition, India is also preparing other paediatric vaccines so that we can immunise the rest of the child population. For Covaxin, trial patient recruitment is over and the result should be available this year. Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, Covovax by Serum Institute of India (SII) which is for five to 17 years is under process and there will be another vaccine for children immunisation. By the end of the year all these results will be available so that when we enter next year, we have two or three options for our child population,"" stated Dr Arora.

Truss, who was in charge of talks with India on a future Free Trade Agreement (FTA) as the International Trade Secretary until her recent promotion within the UK Cabinet, said that she is keen to strike more deals along the lines of AUKUS – the trilateral security alliance between Australia, the UK and the US, which is widely seen as a counter-balance to China. ""We want to work with our friends and allies to create more economic agreements and security agreements. AUKUS is about protecting trade routes and shipping routes specifically with Australia but I want to look at arrangements with India, with Japan and with Canada to expand that security support in the same types of areas,” Truss told The Sunday Times in her first major interview since taking over her new role at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). ""Some countries we will be able to enter deeper security arrangements with than others. One thing I know from being Trade Secretary for two years is that the UK is hugely trusted. People know we are reliable and when we say we will do something we do it, we follow the rules,"" she said. Truss said that Britain would seek alliances with ""freedom-loving"" democracies to challenge the influence of ""malign actors and authoritarian states"" and that security pacts could augment trade deals, pointing to Britain's request to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Asked by the newspaper about these moves being directed at containing the influence of China in the region, she said it is about the ""advancement of freedom"". “It's a positive strategy to engage other countries who want to see a free enterprise, open, free trading world succeed. It's a positive strategy to build economic strength,” she said. The interview comes as the ruling Conservative Party began its annual conference on Sunday in Manchester, where all senior Tory leaders will be addressing party delegates over the course of the next three days.   She told the newspaper: ""The Prime Minister (Boris Johnson) is the great proponent of global Britain.

The board will question lawyers from the WilmerHale firm on Monday about their World Bank investigation report, three people familiar with the plans said. The report alleged that Georgieva, as the bank's CEO in 2017, applied undue pressure on staff to alter data in the flagship ""Doing Business"" report to benefit China. Georgieva, who has strongly denied the accusations, will appear in person before the board on Tuesday, the day she is to deliver a virtual speech about the IMF and World Bank annual meetings October 11-17, two of the sources said. The interviews could prove pivotal in either building or eroding IMF shareholder support for Georgieva. Thus far, the fund's most influential member governments, including top shareholder the United States, have withheld public comment, preferring to let the review process play out. Britain last week said in a statement to Reuters that it supports transparency in the matter. The World Bank tasked WilmerHale with investigating the ""Doing Business"" data irregularities identified in 2020, issuing its findings implicating Georgieva just over two weeks ago. The probe has been led by former US Attorney for the District of Columbia Ron Machen, who is co-chair of WilmerHale's white collar defense and investigations practice. The investigation's report contends Georgieva and former World Bank President Jim Yong Kim's office pressured staff to manipulate data so China's global ranking in the ""Doing Business 2018"" study of investment climates rose to 78th from 85th. The motive was allegedly to help win Beijing's support for a major capital increase that the bank's management was seeking at the time. An IMF spokesman declined to confirm the planned meetings. Spokespersons for WilmerHale in Boston and Washington did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Georgieva also declined to confirm the meetings but said in an emailed statement that Georgieva ""will not be deterred by these false allegations and remains committed to fulfilling the vital mission of the IMF."" Process, Evidence Questions One person familiar with the plan said the board was expected to question the WilmerHale team about its investigatory process - the scope of its assignment, how it conducted the probe and how the decision was made to publish the results, which came with little prior notification to Georgieva. Other questions will seek details on the links drawn in the report between the changes to the ""Doing Business"" data inputs for China and the capital-raising campaign, which resulted in a $13 billion increase to the World Bank's paid-in capital in 2018 that boosted China's shareholding. Another source said there also will likely be questions over discrepancies between witness interviews, the report's conclusions and later public statements from at least one person interviewed. Shanta Devarajan, the former World Bank economist who oversaw the ""Doing Business"" 2018 report released in October 2017, said he never felt pressure from Georgieva, and that the WilmerHale team used only half of his statements.   Machen did not respond to a request for comment. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

The charges brought against Aryan Khan include purchase, possession and use of banned substances, the agency said. He was also seen in a viral video on social media allegedly shot after the raids. Aryan Khan was arrested on Sunday with seven others following a raid at a party on a cruise ship off the coast of Mumbai last night by the Narcotics Control Bureau or NCB.

She has come out with her memoir ""My Life in Full: Work, Family, and Our Future"", in which she recounts the events that shaped her, from her childhood and early education in 1960s India, to the Yale School of Management, to her rise as a corporate leader. These remarks about her interests find mention in the epilogue written especially for the Indian audience. Published by Hachette India, the book offers a blueprint for 21st century prosperity, peppered with masterful insights. ""I departed India 43 years ago, but India has never left me. I am still a vegetarian; I don't smoke or drink alcohol beyond a few sips of wine; I have a puja alcove in my home where I light my lamp every day - and, as much as I love the New York Yankees and American TV shows, I can't resist watching IPL cricket, Kaun Banega Crorepati, Indian movies and Indian Idol,"" she writes. ""They all bring me home to my wonderful upbringing in Madras, and to the energy and rhythms that are so familiar and precious to me,"" she adds. Ms Nooyi finds these shows acting as a window into how India has changed since she was a teenager who dared play Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots are Made for Walkin"" in a rock 'n' roll band. She writes that today's popular media features characters and performers who are strong, educated and determined women making their way in the world, and these shows help young girls understand how they, too, have a voice and can dream of forging an independent life. She also says that she sees plenty of women playing traditional roles that were the norm many decades ago, both on TV and in real life. ""They are deferential, attentive, taking care of everyone, engaged in unpaid labour. I'm reminded that, when it comes to women, India has one foot in the future and one foot in the past,"" she writes. As Ms Nooyi traced her journey while writing this book, she says, she was in awe of how India has passed so many ""intelligent laws to protect its citizens"", and how many of these focus on women. But, she adds that she then ran into a few more facts like women accounting for only 20 per cent of the paid labour force in India, a figure that has fallen by 30 per cent in the last 20 years. ""Women do almost 10 times more unpaid domestic work than men. Although girls are increasingly outperforming boys in school and women now make almost half of college graduates, they fill far fewer entry-level professional jobs,"" she writes. Ms Nooyi says she believes that all women deserve the power to earn money, for their own sake, and for the sake of their children, their communities, and the good of the whole society. She, however, rues that statistics reveal the gap between the law and reality. ""The needle will only move if leadership at all levels commits to improving the situation for all women, including timely justice for those who have often been left behind in rural India and in unorganised sectors of the economy,"" the epilogue says. Ms Nooyi is of the opinion that as India emerges from the devastating impact of Covid, it must rethink some of its economic priorities under the umbrella of ""Atmanirbhar Bharat"". ""I hope whole new ecosystems around next-generation industries emerge, and new investments in core infrastructure, including roads, the railways, water and sanitation, and healthcare,"" she writes. When Ms Nooyi took over as CEO of PepsiCo, one of her pivotal and controversial ideas was to steer the iconic American company toward healthier products and reinvent its environmental profile. The strategy met with immense backlash from some shareholders who wouldn't stand for anything that affected the company's short-term profitability targets. In the book, Ms Nooyi also narrates a particular conversation in the face of tremendous resistance. When she pitched the revolutionary strategy to introduce healthy products, she was asked if she was Mother Teresa.   For a dozen years as one of the world's most admired CEOs, Ms Nooyi redefined what it means to be an exceptional leader. She has been consistently ranked in Forbes's ""The World's 100 Most Powerful Women"", Fortune's ""Most Powerful Women"" and was twice named on TIME magazine's list of the ""100 Most Influential People in the World"".

The party also demanded a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the drugs haul at the port. Last month, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had seized 2,988.21 kg heroin, likely worth ₹ 21,000 crore in the global market, from two containers at the Adani-operated Mundra port in Gujarat's Kutch district. On Sunday, the NCB detained Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan and seven others after raiding a Goa-bound cruise ship in Mumbai and recovering drugs from them. ""There is a news that a Bollywood actor's son has been arrested. Where did this drug come from? The NCB has come out and all of sudden saying that it has caught drugs from a cruise ship,"" Congress' spokesperson Shama Mohamed told reporters. They are deflecting attention from the real issue. The real issue is Mundra port, the drug cartels in the country and drugs that is smuggled from Afghanisthan, she alleged. ""They (NCB) catch some people here and there so that media will show that case, (that will) divert the attention. But I want you all to write about Mundra port. Why is it not being investigated? What is happening there? Why is it being ignored?"" she asked. Had the drugs not come from there (port), there would not have been any party happening (on the cruise ship), she claimed. Seeking a Supreme Court-monitored investigation into the drug seizure at Mundra port, the Congress spokesperson said that drugs are smuggled into India from Afghanisthan, which will fund terrorist organisations, separatist groups and eventually create political instability in the country. She also questioned the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on the drug seizure at Mundra port, which has happened in their home state. ""Gujarat is becoming a hub of drugs smuggling,"" Shama Mohamed said, and expressed apprehensions that privatisation of ports will lead to such activities. The Maharashtra Congress welcomed the raid on the rave party on the cruise ship, but expressed doubt if it was done to suppress the Mundra port drugs seizure. ""It is good if the government stops peddling of drugs and their consumption in the state. We welcome it. But at the same time, it has to be noted that there has been no action or discussion on the seizure of drugs worth ₹ 21,000 crore at the Mundra port in Gujarat. There is room for doubt if such raids are being conducted to shift focus from the last month's seizure,"" state Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe said. He sought to know what action was being taken in the Mundra port seizure case. ""What are the agencies doing to stop drug trafficking from the international borders?"" Atul Londhe asked.   BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said he has learnt from the media about the NCB action on the cruise and he will comment on it since further information on the raid is awaited.

Avoiding the worst-case scenario would require the Taliban to comply with conditions that would enable more international assistance, Josep Borrell wrote in a blog post. ""Afghanistan is experiencing a serious humanitarian crisis and a socio-economic collapse is looming, which would be dangerous for Afghans, the region and international security,"" Borrell wrote. Food prices in the country have jumped more than 50% since the Taliban took power in August as the freezing of $9 billion of Afghanistan's assets held in foreign central bank reserves and the withdrawal of foreign income stokes inflation. The Afghan banking system is largely paralysed, with people unable to withdraw money, while the country's health system - which was heavily dependent on foreign aid - is close to collapse, according to Borrell. ""If the situation continues and with winter approaching, this risks turning into a humanitarian catastrophe,"" he wrote, adding that this could trigger mass migration into neighbouring states. The 27-country EU has increased its humanitarian aid to Afghanistan since the Taliban took power, but halted its development assistance - a move also taken by other countries and the World Bank. The EU response to the crisis would depend on the behaviour of the new Afghan authorities, Borrell said, and any resumption of relations would require compliance with conditions including human rights. ""This requires above all that the Taliban take the steps that will enable the international community to assist the Afghan people,"" he said, adding that female staff from international agencies must be able to do their job. Widespread reports of human rights abuses and the exclusion of girls from schools have dented optimism that the Taliban's approach has changed since it first ran Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001. Borrell met Qatari officials last week in the Qatari capital Doha, where the Taliban have a representation.   He said Qatar's contacts with the Taliban were aimed at moderating their behaviour, and urged Doha to use its contacts with them to ensure the ""worst scenario"" for Afghanistan could be avoided.

At the start of his Conservative Party's conference, Johnson was again forced to defend his government against complaints from those unable to get petrol for their cars, retailers warning of Christmas shortages, and gas companies struggling with a spike in wholesale prices. The British leader had wanted to use the conference to turn the page on more than 18 months of COVID-19 and to refocus on his 2019 election pledges to tackle regional inequality, crime and social care. Instead, the prime minister finds himself on the back foot nine months after Britain completed its exit from the European Union - a departure he said would give the country the freedom to better shape its economy. ""The way forward for our country is not to just pull the big lever marked uncontrolled immigration, and allow in huge numbers of people to do work...So what I won't do is go back to the old failed model of low wages, low skills supported by uncontrolled immigration,"" he told BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""When people voted for change in 2016 and ... again in 2019 as they did, they voted for the end of a broken model of the UK economy that relied on low wages and low skill and chronic low productivity, and we are moving away from that."" It was the closest the prime minister has come to admitting that Britain's exit from the EU had contributed to strains in supply chains and the labour force, stretching everything from fuel deliveries to potential shortages of turkeys for Christmas. ""There will be a period of adjustment, but that is I think what we need to see,"" he said. But he was clear he would not open the taps of immigration to fill such gaps, again shifting the responsibility to businesses to lift wages and attract more workers. Shortages of workers after Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic have sown disarray in some sectors of the economy, disrupting deliveries of fuel and medicines and leaving more than 100,000 pigs facing a cull due to a lack of abbatoir workers. Conservative Party chair, Oliver Dowden, said that the government was taking measures to hire more truck drivers in general and that the government had started training military tanker personnel to start fuel deliveries on Monday. ""We will make sure that people have their turkey for Christmas, and I know that for the Environment Secretary George Eustice this is absolutely top of his list,"" he told Sky News. Rather than the reset Johnson hoped to preside over in the northern English city of Manchester, the conference looks set to be overshadowed by the supply-chain crises and criticism of the government's withdrawal of a top-up to a state benefit for low-income households. Johnson may also come under fire for breaking with the Conservatives' traditional stance as the party of low taxes after increasing them to help the health and social care sectors.   ""We don't want to raise taxes, of course, but what we will not do is be irresponsible with the public finances,"" he said. ""If I can possibly avoid it, I do not want to raise taxes again, of course not."" (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

This is the first time Delhi will get funds under NCAP, a national-level strategy for a 20 to 30 per cent reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 concentration by 2024, with 2017 as the base year for comparison. ""Delhi will get ₹ 18.74 crore under NCAP. This is the first time it will be receiving funds under the programme since it started in 2019,"" an official told PTI. NCAP covers 132 non-attainment cities which do not meet the prescribed national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). These cities have been identified based on the ambient air quality data obtained during the 2011-2015 period under the National Air Monitoring Programme. The acceptable annual standard for PM 10 and PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre and 40 micrograms per cubic metre respectively.

Funds for bigger projects such as management of construction and demolition waste are allocated under the Swachh Bharat Urban programme and other schemes of the central government. The Delhi government has prepared a ""Winter Action Plan"" to tackle air pollution in the capital and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is expected to announce it soon.

The raids were carried out with the assistance of the Jammu and Kashmir Police, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) in the case registered by the NIA on December 9, 2016, under section 17 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, a spokesperson of the NIA said. On April 18, 2019, India indefinitely suspended cross-LoC trade at two points along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, following reports that it was being ""misused"" by elements from across the border to smuggle weapons, narcotics and fake currency. The LoC trade across Chakan-Da-Bagh in Poonch district of Jammu region and Salamabad in Baramulla district of north Kashmir was intended as a confidence-building measure (CBM) for the population living in Jammu and Kashmir and across the LoC in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (Pok). ""LoC trade was started in the year 2008 as part of confidence-building measure between J-K and PoK. The trade was based on barter system and third party origin goods were not allowed. The instant case is related to the large scale transfer of funds from Pakistan to India through the import of California almonds and other items via the cross LoC Trade Facilitation Centres (TFCs) located at Salamabad and Chakkan-Da-Bag,"" the NIA said. The spokesperson said these funds were purportedly being used for fomenting terrorism and separatism in Jammu and Kashmir. ""Investigation into the case revealed that some of the traders having excess imports were channelising the surplus profits generated to terror organisations, while others are suspected to have links/connections with proscribed terrorist organisations,"" the NIA said. During the searches conducted at multiple locations, the spokesperson said documents, digital devices and other incriminating material have been recovered from the premises of the suspects.

The two regional outfits that will be trying their luck for the first time are Revolutionary Goans and Goencho Avaaz. Besides them, the Goa Forward Party (GFP) and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) are also there in the power game. The BJP, which has been in power in the state since 2012 and is vying to continue to be at the helm for the third consecutive term, feels that the more number of parties there are in the fray, the better for it as it will cause division of opposition's votes. The TMC, which is currently in power in West Bengal, recently said that it plans to contest all 40 seats in Goa. Former Congress MLA Luizinho Faleiro joined the TMC a few days back. MGP's former legislator Lavu Mamlakar also joined the Mamata Banerjee-led party. But after that, no other influential local leader has done so. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which rules in Delhi, has also thrown its hat in the ring this time again. It had contested the 2017 Goa Assembly polls, but failed to open its account. The opposition Congress, which has been vying to return to power, seems to be averse to start talks on alliance with like-minded parties. ""It's not my mandate. It is for the high command to decide,"" Goa Pradesh Congress Committee chief Girish Chodankar told reporters recently when asked about the alliance. In 2017, the Congress had won the highest 17 seats in the 40-member House, restricting the BJP to 13. However, surprising the Congress, the saffron party allied with regional parties and formed government under the leadership of senior leader Manohar Parrikar. The party currently has only four MLAs. The GFP, which had initiated the talks of joining hands with the Congress, has also announced that the proposal was on hold. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) also has its presence in the state with its lone MLA Churchill Alemao. A few days back, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said his party would contest 22 to 25 seats in Goa, where elections due in February next year. The party had fought the 2017 election in alliance with other political outfits, like the MGP, but failed to win any seat. Some leaders feel that it was necessary for the opposition parties to come together in order to defeat the ruling BJP. ""Stitching a coalition of opposition parties is the way ahead to defeat BJP in the state. All the parties announcing to fight 40 seats individually will result in giving edge to BJP,"" Independent MLA Rohan Khaunte said. The BJP, however, seems to be meticulously preparing itself for the big fight. The party has already announced that its campaign would be led by Chief Minister Pramod Sawant. It has been working in all the 40 assembly constituencies. Former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has been made the party's election in-charge and he has held a number of meetings during his recent visit to the state. Although the party is grappling with infighting, the intervention of leaders like Fadnavis seems to be helping it tide over the crisis.   ""More entrants will be an advantage to the BJP as opposition's votes will get divided. But we are not banking on the division of votes as our aim is to strengthen the party in all the 40 constituencies,"" a party leader said.

Mr Nath's fitness challenge comes in the wake of Chouhan, 62, repeatedly targetting him over his age and health, saying that he was resting in Delhi. ""There is a lot of debate over my health. Shivrajji is saying that Kamal Nathji is sick and old. Shivraji, I throw a challenge to you, come let us have a race,"" Mr Nath, who is also the leader of the opposition, said in a media statement. ""I did go for my post COVID-19 check up because I had pneumonia - which anyone can have. I got all the tests done. All reports came out good. COVID-19 are of two types - one of short duration and another of a long duration. I faced the long duration one,"" he added. ""I was in Delhi, where I have many responsibilities (of the Congress) to discharge. This does not mean I was in Delhi because I was unwell and resting,"" the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said. A Congress leader said, Mr Nath reached here on Saturday and is scheduled to leave for Delhi on Sunday along with the list of candidates for the October 30 bypolls to three Assembly seats and one Lok Sabha constituency in MP. Talking to PTI about Mr Nath's challenge, MP Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, ""This is an apt reply to CM Chouhan, who was repeatedly needling Nathji that he has grown old, sick and resting in Delhi. Chouhan should keep in mind that he has been defeated in the 2018 MP Assembly poll race by Nathji."" State BJP's senior leader Deepak Vijayavargiya said, ""The BJP runs races for the development and well being of people. But sitting in drawing rooms, the Congress runs races on Twitter and falls. In the October 30 bypolls, people will decide who is the winner. I pray to God for Nath's good health. He must stay fine after defeating coronavirus.""   Both - Mr Nath and Mr Chouhan - had contracted coronavirus. Mr Chouhan had got infected last year and was discharged in August (last year) from a private hospital here after recovery. Nath became the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh in December 2018 after the Congress won the Assembly polls that year. However, his government collapsed in March 2020 following the resignation of 22 MLAs of the then ruling Congress. The government helmed by him lasted only 15 months, after which the BJP came back to power and Chouhan returned as the state the chief minister for the fourth time."

The organiser had for the first time on Saturday disclosed three work-related deaths and 72 serious injuries among 200,000 workers during construction of the site, defending the accident rate as less than half of that of building work in Britain. ""Unfortunately we had three worker related deaths due to Covid. That was during the course of the pandemic,"" Expo representative Sconaid McGeachin told a daily briefing. McGeachin said the three deaths disclosed earlier were construction-related. She referred reporters to local authorities for comment on how many Expo workers had so far caught COVID-19. The Dubai government media office did not immediately respond to an emailed Reuters request for comment. The United Arab Emirates does not give a breakdown for COVID-19 cases and deaths for each emirate, including regional trade and tourism hub Dubai. Huge projects in the Gulf region such as the Expo, and Qatar's preparations for hosting the 2022 FIFA soccer World Cup, have faced international scrutiny, with rights groups criticising conditions for low-paid migrant workers. Overcrowding in worker accommodation was one of the main factors causing a surge of infections in the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf states at the start of the pandemic. Expo 2020 said worker accommodation is audited to ensure conditions are not cramped. The country has rolled out one of the world's fastest vaccination campaigns, with more than 80% of the population of some 10 million people inoculated. The UAE is betting the six-month Expo will attract 25 million visits.   Visitors entering aged 18 and over must show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.

""Dominique Tapie and his family have the immense sadness to announce the death of her husband and their father, Bernard Tapie, this Sunday,"" they said in a statement to La Provence newspaper in Marseille, in which Tapie was a majority stakeholder. One of his sons, Stephane Tapie, confirmed his death with a post of ""Goodbye my Phoenix"" on Instagram. ""He left peacefully, surrounded by his wife, his children and grandchildren, who were at his bedside,"" the statement said, adding that he wished to be buried in Marseille, ""the city of his heart."" Tapie rose from modest beginnings in a rough corner of Paris to become one of France's most successful and high-profile businessmen, flaunting his wealth with American-style flair. He was the longtime chairman of the Marseille football club, bought a cycling team and also found time to act, taking roles that included a police inspector on a popular TV show. Tapie also dabbled in politics, becoming urban affairs minister in the Socialist government of Francois Mitterrand in the 1990s and later a French and European Parliament MP. But his empire collapsed spectacularly in the late 1990s, beginning with a match-fixing trial that saw him serve time in jail. He later faced prosecution over his purchase of the German sports brand Adidas in 1990, which he was forced to sell just a few years later to the state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais.

Ms Rawat and her son Vishal Rawat joined the BJP late on Saturday night in the presence of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan as they were influenced by the party's ideology and its works for the tribal population, state BJP chief VD Sharma said. The Election Commission has announced bypolls to three Assembly segments and a Lok Sabha seat in the state along with several other seats of the country. The polling is scheduled on October 30. Sulochana Rawat, who had won the elections on a Congress ticket from Jobat (ST) Assembly seat twice - in 1998 and 2008 - was considered that party's potential candidate from this seat. However, State Congress spokesman Syed Zaffar alleged that Rawat has a history of ""backstabbing"" the party. ""Our survey found that she was not liked by the voters as the party's candidate. Surprisingly, the BJP, which claimed to be a cadre-based party, did not find its own leader who can be fielded from there,"" he said. It is being speculated that the BJP may field Ms Rawat from Jobat, where the bypoll was necessitated due to the death of Congress MLA Kalawati Bhuria. The other two Assembly seats that will see bypolls are Prithvipur in Niwari and Raigaon in Satna district. On Saturday, the Congress nominated Nitendra Singh Rathore from Prithvipur, which fell vacant due to the death of his (Nitendra Singh Rathore's) legislator father Brijendra Singh Rathore. In Raigaon, the death of BJP MLA Jugal Kishore Bagri necessitated the by-election. Meanwhile, Congress leaders hinted that former union minister Arun Yadav is most likely to be fielded from the Khandwa Lok Sabha seat, which fell vacant following the death of BJP's Member of Parliament (MP) Nandkumar Singh Chouhan.   Senior Congress MLA and former minister Sajjan Singh Verma termed Yadav as the best candidate for the Khandwa LS seat and said, ""Our high command too feels so."" On the other hand, BJP leaders are saying that Harshvardhan Chauhan, whose father's death necessitated this election, was likely to be the BJP candidate from Khandwa LS seat."

The crowd, made up only of men and boys, listened to speeches by leading Taliban officials at Kohdaman township in the hilly outskirts of the capital. The rally was the first of its kind in the capital since the group seized control of the country seven weeks ago following a lightning offensive. Flanked by white and black Taliban standards, and members in full combat gear carrying assault rifles, the speakers addressed an audience that sat in rows of chairs under awnings. To kick off proceedings, a procession of Taliban personnel carrying flags and weapons -- including rocket launchers -- paraded around the crowd. Some of the mainly unarmed supporters waved homemade posters, while others sported red or white Taliban headbands. Tribal elders watched on cross-legged from the side of the stage. As people started arriving, music celebrating the Taliban's actions echoed around the site as dozens of heavily armed Taliban personnel in military combat fatigues stood guard. ""America is defeated, impossible, impossible -- but possible!"" one song said. Some chanted pro-Taliban slogans as they were driven down the dusty road on pick-up trucks to the site, as others shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) when they walked into the shaded area in front of the stage. Women's Protests At the turn-off towards the township, about 10 armed Taliban personnel lined the road beneath a large banner honouring a dead Taliban member and professing the ""support of the people of Kohdaman for the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in the action of liberating the country"". Last Thursday, the Taliban had violently cracked down on a small women's rights demonstration in eastern Kabul, firing shots into the air to disperse protesters. Then, gunmen pushed back the women protesters as they tried to continue with the demonstration, while a foreign journalist was hit with a rifle and blocked from filming. A Taliban terrorist released a brief burst of gunfire into the air with his automatic weapon, AFP journalists saw. Isolated anti-Taliban rallies -- with women at the forefront -- were staged in cities around the country after the group seized power, including in the western city of Herat where two people were shot dead.   But protests have dwindled since the government issued an order banning demonstrations that did not have prior authorisation, warning of ""severe legal action"" for violators. The handful that have gone ahead have been criticised as carefully orchestrated publicity stunts, including a rally at a Kabul university where hundreds of fully veiled women professed support for the new regime."

Pyongyang said Friday it had successfully fired an anti-aircraft missile, the latest in a series of tension-raising steps by the nuclear-armed state, which had until recently been biding its time since the change in US administrations in January. In September, it launched what it said was a long-range cruise missile, and earlier this week tested what it described as a hypersonic gliding vehicle, which South Korea's military said appeared to be in the early stages of development. The tests prompted UN Security Council member states to convene an emergency meeting on North Korea on Friday, called by the United States, Britain and France. The meeting was originally due to take place on Thursday but was delayed. It lasted just over an hour and ended without a statement. But it nonetheless angered Pyongyang, which called it a ""wanton encroachment"" on its sovereignty and a ""serious intolerable provocation"". ""Demanding that we renounce our right to self-defence means an expression of its intention not to acknowledge the DPRK as a sovereign state,"" said Jo Chol Su, director of the Department of International Organisations at the foreign ministry, using the abbreviation for the country's official name. ""I express strong concerns over the fact that the UNSC amused itself with the dangerous 'time-bomb' this time,"" he added in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. North Korea has a long history of using weapons tests as part of a carefully calibrated process to try to forward its objectives. On Wednesday, the country's leader Kim Jong Un decried Washington's repeated offers of talks without preconditions as a ""petty trick"", accusing the Biden administration of continuing the ""hostile policy"" of its predecessors.   Under President Joe Biden, the United States has repeatedly declared its willingness to meet North Korean representatives, while saying it will seek denuclearisation.

Mr Rashid's remarks came after Prime Minister Imran Khan in an interview with Turkish government-owned TRT World news channel revealed that his government was in talks with the TTP with the help of the Taliban in Afghanistan, drawing criticism from politicians and victims of terrorism. The TTP, commonly known as the Pakistani Taliban, is a banned terrorist organisation based along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Defending the government's move, the minister said the offer was not for militants who were responsible for bloodshed in the country, including the December 2014 massacre in the Army Public School (APS) in Peshawar which left over 150 people dead, Dawn newspaper reported. “We know very well who's good and who's bad. Anyone who thinks we are not aware of that, he's mistaken, he doesn't have sense,” he said. The offer of talks was only for “good Taliban” and negotiations on this were taking place at the “highest-level,"" he said. He maintained that it was not appropriate to fight with those who have surrendered to adopt peaceful lives. “The case of those who were involved in incidents like the APS is different. And the case of those who left the country for different reasons is different,” he said on Friday while responding to a question about the merit and mechanism of talks with the TTP. “We are not surrendering to anyone and this process is at a very early phase. No one needs to jump to conclusions at this stage.” Prime Minister Khan on Friday offered amnesty to the TTP provided the militant organisation lay down arms, disclosing that the government was holding talks with some groups of the outfit seeking reconciliation. The disclosure attracted a strong reaction, mainly from the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which questioned the move to hold negotiations with the TTP without taking Parliament into confidence, arguing that it would only add to the pain and grief of the families of the martyrs.   The TTP has been involved in various attacks in Pakistan for more than a decade which killed thousands of people. The government is now trying to use the influence of the Afghan Taliban over the TTP to reach a peace deal and end violence.

""The damage could be insurmountable,"" the Panamanian government said in the letter, sent through a law firm to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The letter warns that ""any publication"" reinforcing ""a false perception"" of the country as a possible tax haven ""will have devastating consequences for Panama and its people."" The ICIJ tweeted that it would release Sunday 1630 GMT its ""most expansive expose of financial secrecy yet,"" based on the leak of 11.9 million documents ""covering every corner of the globe."" The ""Pandora Papers"" investigation is the result of work by more than 600 reporters in 117 countries, the ICIJ said. The letter from the Panamanian government also references some of the reforms that the Central American country has made in recent years, although it remains on the EU list of tax havens. It also indicates that since 2016 the registration of more than 395,000 companies and foundations has been suspended, around half of those existing at that time. The government fears that Panama will again be the epicenter of a new global tax havens scandal like the one that followed the ICIJ's disclosure of the ""Panama Papers"" in 2016. That massive data leak exposed widespread tax avoidance and evasion using complex structures of offshore shell companies and caused an international outcry. The leak, linked to the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, damaged Panama's international image, despite the fact that most of the companies involved were overseas. The investigation revealed the concealment of properties, companies, assets, profits and tax evasion by heads of state and government, political leaders and personalities from finance, sports and the arts. Since then, Panama has carried out various legal reforms to strengthen banking controls and penalize tax evasion with jail time.

716,Sun Oct 03 07:49:44 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: Philippines Vice President May Run For President In May 2022 Elections https://t.co/hvWNUEkByX https://t.co/o2k6jFxa2U,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/philippines-vice-president-leni-robredo-may-run-for-president-in-may-2022-elections-2562100,Philippines Vice President May Run For President In May 2022 Elections,"Philippines' Vice President Leni Robredo will decide this week if she will run for president, her spokesman said Sunday, after her arch-rival and incumbent Rodrigo Duterte declared he was retiring from politics. Robredo, a vocal critic of Duterte's controversial drug war, would likely be the only opposition candidate in a crowded field in the May 2022 elections. Her spokesperson Barry Gutierrez told AFP she has not yet accepted the opposition coalition's nomination, and will announce her decision before the filing deadline on October 8. Duterte, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a second term, had declared in August he would run for the vice presidency. But in a surprise announcement Saturday, he said he would retire -- which was met with deep scepticism among analysts. Duterte made a similar announcement in September 2015, saying he ""will retire from public life for good"" only to declare his presidential bid two months later. Duterte has not named a successor, but indicated his daughter Sara will run alongside his longtime aide Senator Christopher Go. A broadcaster asked him Saturday if it was ""clear it will be Sara-Go"". Duterte responded, ""It's Sara-Go."" Surveys have shown Sara Duterte, boxing great Manny Pacquiao -- the son and namesake of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos -- and celebrity mayor Francisco Domagoso are the frontrunners among potential presidential candidates. Pacquiao and Domagoso have announced they are running, while the other two have yet to confirm. Sara Duterte has not responded to AFP's request for confirmation. Most of the top candidates have supported Duterte's controversial drug war, and political analysts say Vice President Robredo could struggle to compete if she decides to run. Filipino voters are willing to elect a female president but they want her to be ""feisty"", said University of the Philippines political science professor Jean Franco. ""(Vice President Robredo is) too good, she's too nice,"" said Franco. Robredo, 56, narrowly won the nation's second top job in 2016, defeating Marcos' son and namesake. Her victory dealt a blow to the political aspirations of the former dictator's family, including a possible return to the presidential office. The Philippines' election season kicked off Friday as celebrities and political scions flocked to the offices of the elections commission to file their nominations.   The process launches a typically noisy and deadly seven months of campaigning for more than 18,000 positions, with the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn caused by lockdowns expected to dampen the party atmosphere.

717,Sun Oct 03 06:46:43 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: 26 Women Candidates Unsuccessful In Qatar's First Legislative Elections https://t.co/IN2lxIyjIP https://t.co/43ATnmxjNK,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/qatar-elections-26-women-candidates-unsuccessful-in-qatars-first-legislative-elections-2562074,26 Women Candidates Unsuccessful In Qatar's First Legislative Elections,"Voters chose none of the 26 women who stood for election in Qatar's first legislative elections on Saturday, disappointing candidates who had wanted to lend a voice for women and other Qataris in the Gulf monarchy's political process. The vote was for 30 members of the 45-seat advisory Shura Council, with the emir continuing to appoint the remaining 15 members of the body which can approve a limited scope of policies for the small but wealthy country that bans political parties. ""To have all men is not the vision of Qatar,"" said Aisha Hamam al-Jasim, 59, a nursing manager who ran in Doha's Markhiya district. She urged Qatari women to start ""voicing what they believe in"" and vote for strong women candidates in future. ""For the first time in Qatar, this is the opportunity to take part in the political,"" she said as people trickled into the polls earlier on Saturday. Jasim, like fellow female candidates, said she had encountered some men who thought women should not run. Highlighting her administrative skills, she focused on policy priorities like health, youth employment and retirement. ""I just say: I'm strong, I'm capable, I see myself as fit as a man...If you want to see me as weak, that's up to you, but I am not weak,"" she said in the polling station where men and women had separate entrances. While Qatar has introduced reforms to women's rights in recent years, including allowing women to independently get a driving license, it has been criticised by rights groups for issues like the guardianship system, where a woman needs male permission to marry, travel and access reproductive healthcare. Human Rights Watch in March said that when in 2019 women tweeted from an anonymous account about Qatar's guardianship system, the account shut down within 24 hours after cyber security officials summoned one woman. Naima Abdulwahab al-Mutaawa'a, a candidate and foreign ministry worker whose elderly mother came to vote for her, had wanted to press for a body advocating for women and children. Several female candidates had been seeking to improve the integration into Qatari society of children of female citizens married to foreigners who, like in other Gulf states, cannot pass their Qatari nationality to their children. While Jasim stopped short of advocating for granting passports, fellow candidate Leena al-Dafa called for full citizenship for children in such cases. Dafa, a writer, does not see those who oppose women in the Shura Council as an obstacle because the ruling emir - and the law - support female participation. ""The law gives me this right...I don't care what aggressive people say about that,"" she said, adding that women were best suited to discuss their issues. Al-Maha al-Majid, a 34-year-old industrial engineer stood for election, alongside her policies, to change mindsets. ""To convince the males (to vote for women), yes, we may have to put in work or extra effort...I'm willing to take this extra effort in order to be in and to convince this society that the women can do so,"" she said. For some, attitudes are hard to shake. Male candidate Sabaan Al Jassim, 65, supports women standing in elections but said their primary role remains in the family. ""They are here, they have their fingerprint and they have their vote and a voice...But most important is in the house, to take care of the kids with the families,"" he said at a polling station where Jasim and Mutaawa'a sat across the room from him.   Qatar currently has only one female minister: Public Health Minister Hanan Mohamed Al Kuwari.

Dr Swaminathan, who was speaking at NDTV's Swasth Bharat, Sampann Bharat Telethon, listed out four big achievements of the country - from the elimination of polio and a few other vaccine-preventable diseases to reducing maternal and child mortality to universal health coverage to India becoming the pharmacy of the world. The top scientist, however, spotlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the delivery of essential health services in almost every country, including India. There has been a setback in tuberculosis treatment, non-communicable diseases, in delivery of ante-natal and child health services in India, she noted. ""There needs to be a good stock take of where exactly more attention will need to be paid in the coming months, and not only to catch up, but also ensure that we create resilience within the system to ensure, that if there are future health shocks, and there are bound to be health shocks in the future, that we can deal with those without having to compromise on other essential health services,"" said Dr Swaminathan. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), malnutrition is a major contributor to disease burden in India and a predominant risk factor for death among children younger than 5 years of age. The Covid pandemic has exacerbated the situation. Dr Swaminathan has cautioned experts to look at the data carefully as the virus has upended families and pushed people into poverty. ""The Covid pandemic has also increased the rates of poverty and is likely to increase undernutrition in the community. So we need to really look at the data carefully increasing rates of poverty and under nutrition could drive up the incidence of diseases like tuberculosis, but also other diseases that are related to poverty. So this is something that we will need to watch closely and take preemptive action on,"" she added.   Covid infections in India have been decreasing and have stayed below 30,000 daily in the past week. "

The commission's research uncovered between 2,900 and 3,200 paedophile priests or other members of the church, said Jean-Marc Sauve, adding that it was ""a minimum estimate"". The commission's report is due to be released on Tuesday after two and a half years of research based on church, court and police archives, as well as interviews with witnesses. Sauve, a senior French civil servant, said the report, which runs to 2,500 pages, had attempted to quantify both the number of offenders and the number of victims. It also looked into ""the mechanisms, notably institutional and cultural ones"" within the Church which allowed paedophiles to remain, and will offer 45 proposals. The independent commission was set up in 2018 by the Bishops' Conference of France (CEF) in response to a number of scandals that shook the Church in France and worldwide. Its formation also came after Pope Francis passed a landmark measure obliging those who know about sex abuse in the Catholic Church to report it to their superiors. Made up of 22 legal professionals, doctors, historians, sociologists and theologians, its brief was to investigate allegations of child sex abuse by clerics dating back to the 1950s. When it began its work it called for witness statements and set up a telephone hotline, then reported receiving thousands of messages in the months that followed. 'A Bomb' The report will be delivered to the CEF and released at a press conference Tuesday to which representatives of victims' associations are invited. ""It will be an explosion,"" one member of the commission told AFP on condition of anonymity."" ""It will have the effect of a bomb"", added Olivier Savignac, of the victim's association Parler et Revivre. Bishop Eric de Moulins-Beaufort, the president of the CEF, said he feared that the report would unveil ""significant and frightening figures"", during a meeting with parishioners from his diocese. A message from Church authorities to priests and parishes for weekend masses warned that the report's publication would be ""a harsh and serious moment"", which calls for ""an attitude of truth and compassion"". Sauve had said in November that the handling of suspected paedophile cases ""in the past has often been faulty"".   He said it was ""extremely serious that there could have been some institutions and some communities, in small number, where systemic abuses could have been committed"".

Shah Rukh Khan was seen leaving his home and heading for his lawyer's office shortly before the arrest was confirmed. Aryan Khan was also seen in a viral video on social media allegedly shot after the raids. The high-profile raid yielded 13 grams of cocaine, 21 grams of charas, 22 pills of MDMA and 5 grams of MD in all, the NCB has said. The charges brought against Aryan Khan include purchase, possession and use of banned substances, it added. He was produced in court in the evening where the agency was granted custody of those arrested till Monday. Aryan Khan's lawyer Satish Maneshinde demanded bail, saying that his client had been arrested only on the basis of chat messages. ""Aryan had no ticket, no cabin or seat on board the cruise. He was there because he had been invited. He didn't even have a boarding pass. Nothing has been found on him. He was arrested on the basis of chat only."" Besides Aryan Khan, the NCB had earlier released the names of the seven people who had been detained for questioning from the ship - Munmun Dhamecha, Nupur Sarika, Ismeet Singh, Mohak Jaswal, Vikrant Chhoker, Gomit Chopra, Arbaaz Merchant. The NCB team boarded the Goa-bound ship disguised as passengers on Saturday morning, sources said. According to officials, the party began after the ship left Mumbai and was at sea. The raids began at 10 am and went on till 2 pm, it said. During the operation, the suspects were searched and different drugs were recovered from them, which they had hidden in their clothes, undergarments and purses, an NCB official told news agency PTI. The cruise company in a statement on Sunday said it had nothing to do with the incident. ""Cordelia Cruises is in no way, directly or indirectly, connected to this incident. Cordelia Cruises had chartered its ship for a private event to a Delhi-based event management company,"" Jurgen Bailom, Chief Executive Officer and President, Waterways Leisure Tourism Pvt Ltd said in a statement. ""We, at Cordelia Cruises, condemn all acts such as these and will strictly refrain from letting our ship out for similar events in the future. Nonetheless, Cordelia Cruises is extending our full support and cooperating with the authorities,"" it added. The Congress, which is part of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, on Sunday alleged that the raid and subsequent action was an attempt to divert attention from the ""real issue"" of the drugs seizure at Mundra port in Gujarat.   The Narcotics Control Bureau has stepped up action on anti-drugs cases since last year following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and a wide-ranging investigation into alleged drug abuse. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence had also seized close to 3,000 kg of heroin at Gujarat's Mundra port early last month, and recovered around 37 kg of the narcotic drug, along with cocaine - or substance suspected to be the contraband items - from Delhi and Noida in Uttar Pradesh."

""We join our friends in India and around the world to celebrate the 152nd birthday of Mahatma Gandhi,"" US Secretary of State Tony Blinken tweeted on Saturday. He recalled the remarks of President Joe Biden a week ago during his joint media appearance with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Oval Office of the White House.

The polling was held in Bhabanipur, Jangipur and Samserganj assembly constituencies of the state on September 30. The poll body has arranged for a three-tier security system, called in 24 companies of central forces and have already deployed them at the counting centre. The entire area will be put under CCTV surveillance. Officials will only be allowed pen and paper and only the returning officer and observer are allowed to use phones, officials informed. The counting will be held in 21 rounds for the Bhabanipur constituency, 26 rounds for Samserganj and 24 rounds for the Jangipur constituency at the Sakhawat Memorial School of Kolkata Votes will be counted today for the by-election held in Bhabanipur, a south Kolkata legislative constituency, that Mamata Banerjee has to win to remain West Bengal Chief Minister, having lost the seat she fought in state polls earlier this year. The Chief Minister has had to contest the by-poll because, despite her own party's tremendous victory in the assembly polls held this Match-April, she could not win from Nandigram. The BJP put up a tough fight there through its recruit Suvendu Adhikari, a confidante-turned-foe of the Chief Minister. While the Trinamool Congress has claimed that the party chief will win by a margin of over 50,000 votes, the BJP, which fielded 41-year-old greenhorn Priyanka Tibrewal, claimed to have given a ""very good fight"". Mamata Banerjee must win the elections to enter the state assembly before the end of her first six months as Chief Minister in this term."

In commemorating this day, we also celebrate the legacy of this remarkable man who taught us that there is nothing cowardly about non-violence.""

Iran has rejected direct talks with the United States, and indirect talks on reviving a 2015 nuclear accord aimed at keeping Iran from being able to develop a nuclear weapon stopped in June. The United States used intermediaries at the United Nations last month to attempt to make contact, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told state television. Iran has been unable to obtain tens of billions of dollars of its assets in foreign banks, mainly from exports of oil and gas, due to U.S. sanctions on its banking and energy sectors. ""The Americans tried to contact us through different channels (at the U.N. General Assembly) in New York, and I told the mediators if America's intentions are serious then a serious indication was needed ... by releasing at least $10 billion of blocked money,"" the minister said. ""They are not willing to free $10 billion belonging to the Iranian nation so that we can say that the Americans once in the past several decades considered the interests of the Iranian nation,"" Amirabdollahian said in the TV interview. Western powers have urged Iran to return to negotiations and said time is running out as Tehran's nuclear programme is advancing well beyond the limits set by the deal. Amirabdollahian reiterated that Iran would ""soon"" return to the stalled nuclear talks in Vienna, declining to give a date.   Tehran says its nuclear steps are reversible if Washington lifts all sanctions. Iranian and Western officials have said many issues remain to be resolved before the accord can be revived.

Turkish photographer Savas Karakas was one of the first to board a motor boat and then dive to the seabed grave when the park opened on Saturday. There, he says, he was able to reconnect with his grandfather who fought in the Gallipoli campaign of 1915. ""My grandfather's hands were disfigured and burned in action, and I was always scared of them,"" said Karakas, who lives in Istanbul and whose given name means ""war"", after the battle. ""But when I come to Gallipoli and dive, the rusted metal and steel of the wrecks reminds me of my grandfather's hands and I hold his hand under the water."" The Gallipoli Historic Underwater Park opened 106 years after Ottoman and allied German forces halted an invasion by British, French, Australian and New Zealand troops. The Ottoman resistance remains a point of deep pride in modern Turkey. At the time, it thwarted the Allies' plan to control the straits connecting the Aegean to the Black Sea, where their Russian naval allies were penned in. Heavy British losses included the 120-meter HMS Majestic battleship, which is the first stop for divers at a depth of 24 meters off the coast of Seddulbahir. It and other vessels are largely intact on the sea floor. ""We are a fortunate generation because we ... can still visit those monuments,"" said Ali Ethem Keskin, another underwater photographer from Istanbul.   ""When I started diving ...

Johnson had wanted to use the conference this week to turn the page on more than 18 months of COVID-19 and to refocus on his 2019 election pledges to tackle regional inequality, crime and social care. Instead, the prime minister finds himself on the back foot more than nine months since Britain completed its exit from the European Union - a departure he said would hand the country the freedom to better shape its economy. He is now faced with an outcry by those unable to fill up their cars with petrol, by retailers who fear there may be shortages of Christmas fare and by gas companies struggling with a spike in wholesale prices. In a statement released on the eve of the conference in the city of Manchester, Johnson did not refer to the ongoing crises and instead talked up what he called his government's ""track record of delivering on the people's priorities"". ""We didn't go through Covid to go back to how things were before -- to the status quo ante. Build Back Better means we want things to change and improve as we recover,"" he said. ""That means taking the big, bold decisions on the priorities people care about - like on social care, on supporting jobs, on climate change, tackling crime and levelling up."" He repeated his mantra that the government did all it could to prop up businesses during the pandemic, to protect jobs and had successfully rolled out a mass vaccination programme. But for many critics, this often repeated statement underscores a refusal to acknowledge missteps in the early days of the pandemic when the government seemed reluctant to lockdown the economy to stop the spread of the virus.   At the conference, the withdrawal of a top-up to a state benefit for low-income households and the end of a COVID jobs support scheme might also attract criticism from some lawmakers, particularly those from regions in northern and central England which have traditionally supported the opposition Labour Party.

Britain said last week it would issue temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers and 5,500 poultry workers to try to solve acute labour shortages that have disrupted the supply of fuel to gas stations and caused difficulties in food production. Britain's Road Haulage Association (RHA) says the country is facing a shortage of some 100,000 drivers, a result of workers leaving the industry, the pandemic putting a stop to driver training and testing for about a year, and post-Brexit immigration rules which prevent hiring drivers from Europe. Speaking to reporters during a visit to a hospital, Johnson did not rule out the possibility of issuing more temporary visas. ""What we have now is a system that allows us to control immigration, and that gives us flexibility. We can open up our markets if we need to, and of course we'll keep everything under review,"" Johnson said. The government has said 200 military tanker personnel will help deliver fuel from Monday.   ""What we don't want to do is go back to a situation in which we basically allowed the road haulage industry to be sustained with a lot of low wage immigration,"" Johnson said.

Large crowds gathered in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Brasilia and dozens of other towns and cities as part of the ""Bolsonaro Out National Campaign,"" which is backed by a dozen left-wing political parties and labor groups. Among other issues, the right-wing president has come under stinging criticism for his handling of the pandemic, which has claimed nearly 600,000 lives here. Hundreds of people marched through the central Rio de Janeiro neighborhood of Candelaria, shouting ""Bolsonaro out!"" which was also emblazoned on several large banners. ""We're going to get him out. The hope of the people here in the streets is to put pressure on legislators so that they call for impeachment,"" 69-year-old retired professor Elizabeth Simoes told AFP. More than 100 requests for the impeachment of Bolsonaro have been filed with the Chamber of Deputies, but its leader Arthur Lira, a government ally, has refused to take any of them up. The Supreme Court has ordered several investigations into Bolsonaro and his aides, including for spreading false information. In Sao Paulo, tens of thousands of people gathered Saturday afternoon on the central Paulista Avenue. Meanwhile, hundreds of demonstrators gathered along the Esplanade of Ministries in Brasilia. Local media counted protests in 20 of Brazil's 27 states, and in 60 cities, including 14 state capitals. Red flags of the Workers' Party of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, or Lula, could be seen Saturday, along with Brazilian flags and the signs of several other left-wing and centrist parties often seen at protests against the far-right Bolsonaro. - 'Can't stand this government' - In recent months, protests led by leftist movements have demanded Bolsonaro's impeachment due to his mismanagement of the pandemic. But Saturday's demonstrations were also against a hike in food and fuel prices, as well as for relief for the 14.1 million unemployed people throughout the country. ""The population is going hungry, and we can't stand this government any longer,"" said Isadora Lessa, 22, in Rio. ""What is the importance of being here? That he knows he doesn't have unanimity, that he's going to have a hard time getting elected again,"" said Marcelo Werneck, who joined the protests in Rio in memory of the ""friends and family"" who died of Covid-19. ""If he doesn't face an impeachment, he loses the election in 2022,"" Werneck added. Besieged by judicial investigations and the economic crisis, Bolsonaro's popularity has plummeted in recent months to 22 percent, its lowest level since he took office in January 2019. But backers of the president have also made themselves known in recent weeks, as around 125,000 of them gathered in Brasilia and Sao Paulo September 7 in a show of support for Bolsonaro.   A mid-September opinion poll by the Datafolha Institute found that Bolsonaro has 26 percent support compared with Lula's 44 percent, just one year ahead of the presidential vote.

The Bhim Army activists “tried to snatch the youth's body” to further hold demonstration despite the administration having acceded earlier the demands of the youth's family members after their protest and they had proceeded to cremate the body, Ghaziabad's (SP (Rural) Iraj Raja said. The youth, Rahul, was earlier battered with lathis and irons rods by three miscreants over two and half months back and he died on Saturday during his treatment, first at a hospital and then at his home at Sangam Vihar under the Loni Border police station area, Mr Raja said. The police had already arrested the trio – Ankit, Poojan and Monu -- earlier after booking them on various charges, including the attempt to murder and various other offences under the stringent Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Mr Raja said. The police will now add section 302 of the IPC for the offence of murder in the FIR lodged against the trio, who, he said, is presently under judicial custody. After Rahul died on Saturday, his family members sat outside the Indira Puri police outpost with the body, demanding ₹ 30 lakh as compensation, a government job for his wife and free education to his children, Mr Raja said. The demonstration led the area revenue officer to visit the protest site and appease family members with the promise of statutory compensation to them, besides a recommendation to the government for payment of a compensation to them, said Mr Raja. Satisfied with the government's promise, Rahul's family members began preparation to take the body to the cremation ground when some Bhim Army activists reached the site and tried to snatch the body from them to prolong the sit-in and “do politics” over it, said Mr Raja. Seeing the tension in the area, the local shopkeepers downed their shutters while the police too intervened instantly and arrested 10 Bhim Army activists, who even clashed with policemen, said Mr Raja,   They were booked under various penal offences including sections 332 (assault), 353 (use of criminal force against public servant), 504 (breach of peace), 506 (intimidation), 147 (rioting), 148 (armed rioting), 188 (disobedience to duly promulgated government's order), 269 (doing activities with the potential to spread an infectious disease) and 297 (hurting religious feelings) of the IPC, said Mr Raja.

Mohammed Khalifa, 38 and born in Saudi Arabia, was captured during a firefight in January 2019 by Kurdish-dominated Syrian forces allied with the United States. He was handed over ""recently"" to US authorities and charged in Virginia with conspiring to provide material support to ISIS resulting in death, says a Justice Department statement. Khalifa left Canada in 2013 to join the ISIS group in Syria, and by the next year had become a key member of its propaganda team because of his fluent English and Arabic, according to the statement. He allegedly served as a lead translator in ISIS propaganda production and as the English-speaking narrator on two violent recruitment videos. This cell was behind videos showing the beheadings of foreigners including the US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, who died in 2014. He faces a possible life sentence in the United States. Canada additionally hopes to charge him, according to media there. In an exchange of emails cited in the charge sheet, Khalifa defended the ISIS killings he was associated with. ""Mohammed Khalifa not only fought for ISIS on the battlefield in Syria, but he was also the voice behind the violence,"" said Acting US Attorney Raj Parekh for the Eastern District of Virginia. According to the indictment, Khalifa's ""primary focus"" was ""enticing ISIS supporters to travel to ISIS-controlled areas to join ISIS or to conduct attacks in the West, including in the United States."" The jihadist group, classified as a terrorist organization by US authorities, is responsible for a wave of deadly attacks in Western countries. Its emergence prompted intervention by a US-led international military coalition, which succeeded in defeating the self-proclaimed ""caliphate"" even though ISIS is still present in many additional countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, and continues to pose a threat according to US and European intelligence services. - 'Glorified' murders, cruelty - In a 2019 interview with Canada's CBC from his Syrian prison, Khalifa showed no regret for his actions. He said he wanted to return to Canada with his wife and their three children, but on the condition that he would not be tried there. ""Through his alleged leading role in translating, narrating, and advancing ISIS's online propaganda, Khalifa promoted the terrorist group, furthered its worldwide recruitment efforts, and expanded the reach of videos that glorified the horrific murders and indiscriminate cruelty of ISIS,"" Parekh said. This is the first known indictment of a foreign ISIS fighter in America since President Joe Biden took power in January. Two members of the notorious ISIS kidnapping cell dubbed the ""Beatles,"" Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, are currently in the hands of US authorities after being transferred to the United States from Iraq nearly a year ago. The pair are accused of involvement in the murders of Foley and Sotloff, as well as those of relief workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller.   Kotey, a former British national who was stripped of his citizenship, pleaded guilty in early September to charges of conspiring to murder the four American hostages.

The chief minister also counselled police to build their clean image among the people. “An impartial investigation by the police is very necessary for solving cases. If the police action is fair, there will be no question mark on it, otherwise media trial will start which will tarnish the image of the police,” Chief Minister Adityanath said during a programme at the Police Headquarters here. During the programme, he felicitated 75 police personnel by giving them medals for their outstanding work. The Uttar Pradesh police has been facing severe criticism by the opposition parties following the death of a Kanpur businessman in Gorakhpur, the chief minister's home district, earlier this week during a raid by police at the hotel in which the businessmen had been staying. Reminding police of their duty and responsibility, Mr Adityanath said, “The Uttar Pradesh police is the world's largest police force and every policeman connected with it should feel proud.” “The policemen should make their active and positive contribution in the progress of their organisation and maintain its credibility,” he added. Law and order has a positive effect on the all-round development of the state and it facilitates large-scale investment which generates employment, he said.   Cautioning the police force, he said, ""Efforts should be made to ensure that no situation of a media trial created in any case. To prevent this, it is necessary that the police put the right facts in front of the media in a concise and timely manner.'' He also stressed the proper monitoring of social media and said extending security is the duty of the government and the police have an important role in it."

Thailand's tourism industry has been on its knees, with the coronavirus pandemic and related restrictions slashing visitor numbers from 40 million in 2019 to a mere trickle over the last two years. Pre-virus, the sector made up a fifth of Thailand's national income, and the travel curbs have fed into the country's worst economic performance in more than two decades. The kingdom launched a ""sandbox"" scheme in July, which allowed fully vaccinated travellers from countries considered low-to-medium risk to roam free on the popular beach island for a fortnight, and then afterwards travel to the mainland without quarantine. Last week, authorities cut the required stay to a week, in line with national changes to quarantine rules. The Tourism Authority of Thailand announced late Friday that the scheme had been broadened from the around 80 countries already eligible. ""This means Thailand is now welcoming travellers from any country in the world to the sandbox programme,"" it said in a statement. Foreign Ministry spokesman Tanee Sangrat said unvaccinated children would be able to travel with their vaccinated parents. The sandbox programme has already lured more than 38,000 visitors to the white sands of Phuket, and generated $66.67 million. But tourism operators are lukewarm on the revival of the island's economy, where 90 percent of hotels have been shuttered. They have been pleading for the government to simplify entry requirements to increase visitor numbers. The changes will allow previously excluded Indonesians and Malaysians to travel to Phuket. Before the pandemic, Malaysia was Thailand's second biggest source of tourists, with more than four million travellers visiting in 2019. Thai authorities hope to reopen five other destinations, including capital Bangkok, using the sandbox model from the start of November, followed by 20 more locations in December once vaccination rates increase. However, travel advice from other countries discouraging would-be tourists could hamper Thailand's plans to reboot the industry. Britain and the US have issued travel warnings as the country grapples with a deadly third wave of the virus and low vaccination rates.   Daily new case numbers are hovering at around 11,000, following a peak of 23,000 in August -- but testing levels have also declined.

On the question of negative press about his decisions, the Prime Minister said he attaches ""big importance"" to criticism. ""Imagine if our country had not come up with a vaccine. What would be the situation? We know that a large population of the world doesn't have access to Covid vaccines. Today, our success in vaccination is thanks to India being atmanirbhar,"" PM Modi said in an interview to Open magazine. Sixty-nine per cent of the country's adult population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and 25 per cent has taken both doses, the government said earlier this week. It aims to inoculate all eligible population by December-end. PM Modi said most people only level allegations as they lack the time to study the issue, while criticism is rooted in research. ""I, with an honest mind, respect critics a lot. But, unfortunately, the number of critics is very low. Mostly, people only level allegations, the people who play games about perception are more in number. And the reason for this is that , for criticism, one has to do a lot of hard work, research and, in today's fast-paced world, may be people don't have time. So sometimes, I miss critics,"" he added. ""We need to look at the entire logistics, planning and progress to understand the success of the vaccine drive. It is a huge effort with so many people mobilised across the country. I hope the media will take time out to highlight the efforts of our people in making the world's largest vaccination drive a stunning success,"" the PM told the magazine. The Prime Minister spotlighted how at a science conference a few years ago he suggested it was time to move away from ""Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan"" and work on the mantra of ""Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, Jai Anusandhan (research)"". He said his government gives top priority to research. ""We started planning for the vaccination drive right in May 2020 when no vaccine was even close to approval anywhere in the world. We had decided as early as then that we did not want this vaccination drive to run in the old way where it could take decades to vaccinate people. We wanted this to run in a fast, efficient, discretion-free and timebound manner,"" said the Prime Minister. Two vaccines for coronavirus: Covishield, which has been developed by British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is manufactured in India by Pune-based Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin, developed by homegrown Bharat Biotech, received emergency approval from the country's drug regulator at the start of this year. Elaborating his point, the Prime Minister said the poor today does not have to wait or pay a bribe to avail services he deserves. A poor migrant, said PM Modi, can take his second dose of vaccine in the city he works in, even if he took the first dose in his village. Technology ensures he gets the right vaccine at the right time and seamlessly, the Prime Minister said. ""When we compare India's situation in the world, we have done better than many developed countries. However, we have in our midst vested interests whose only aim is to tarnish India's name. COVID-19 was a global scourge with all countries equally affected. In this scenario, India has done better that its peers and many developed countries, notwithstanding such negative campaigns,"" he said. Reeling off numbers and his government's focus on healthcare, the Prime Minister said from six All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in 2014, the nation is now building 22 such institutes; from 380 medical colleges in 2014, there are now around 560 such colleges. The government is also working on launching a massive scheme to boost health infrastructure that will address a lot of legacy issues, said the Prime Minister. ""We are actively focusing on preventive healthcare. From improved sanitation to water supply, from yoga to Ayurveda, from strengthening diagnostic centres in remote areas, we are doing it all,"" he stressed. PM Modi credited the country for its ability to unite, come together and deliver in this hour of grave crisis. ""From being a net importer of PPE kits, we have now become one of the biggest manufacturers across the globe. Similarly, we not only managed to exponentially increase the number of ventilators but also did so largely through domestic manufacturing. India achieved this despite limited global knowledge about the virus, the economic impact of lockdown and existing state capacity constraints. Is there any better evidence of our ability to bring transformative change?"" asked PM Modi.   On the criticism against the banging of thalis and lighting diyas, the Prime Minister said there was a need to boost the morale of healthcare and frontline workers. He said the event turned into a big mass movement. "

The images were obtained almost three years after the unmanned mission vessel was launched aboard an Ariane 5 Rocket. The cameras attached the BepiColombo provided black-and-white images, the ESA said in a statement. But as the spacecraft arrived on the night side of the planet, conditions were ""not ideal"" for taking images at its closest approach to the planet, an altitude of 199 kilometres (124 miles), so the closest was from about 1,000 km. The region shown is part of Mercury's northern hemisphere, including large craters and an area flooded by lava billions of years ago. ""The flyby was flawless from the spacecraft point of view, and it's incredible to finally see our target planet,"" said Elsa Montagnon, Spacecraft Operations Manager for the mission. The BepiColombo mission will study all aspects of this mysterious inner planet from its core to surface processes, magnetic field and exosphere, ""to better understand the origin and evolution of a planet close to its parent star"", said the agency. Mercury is also the only rocky planet orbiting the Sun beside our own to have a magnetic field. Magnetic fields are generated by a liquid core but given its size, Mercury's should have grown cold and solid by now, as Mars did. This anomaly might be due to some feature of the core's composition, something BepiColombo's instruments will measure with much greater precision than has been possible so far. On its surface, Mercury is a planet of extremes, vacillating between hot days of about 430 degrees Celsius (more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit) to super-frosty nights of minus 180C (minus 290F). Those days and nights last nearly three Earth months each. Earlier missions have detected evidence of ice in the deepest recesses of the planet's polar craters. Scientists speculate that this may have accumulated from comets crashing onto Mercury's surface. BepiColombo is due to make five more flybys of Mercury during a complex trajectory that will also see the satellite fly past Venus and Earth. It could not be sent directly to Mercury, as the Sun's pull is so strong that a huge braking manoeuvre would be needed to place the satellite successfully, requiring too much fuel for a spacecraft of this size. The mission will last for around another five years.   The gravity exerted by the Earth and Venus -- known as gravitational assist -- allows it to slow down 'naturally' during its journey.

Those below 5 years of age -- with lower immunity -- are considered most vulnerable to Covid. Poshan on Wheels -- a nationwide central government programme to evaluate the malnutrition among children -- is being carried out to check malnutrition levels in children of tea garden workers. The programme also aims to identify the children most vulnerable to Covid in case a third wave strikes. The focus is on the most vulnerable tea tribe community, already low on nourishment and immunity. ""The experts have been saying that children are most vulnerable and in tea gardens they are most, so the government thought that it has to focus on children nutrition and immunity,"" said Assam's Tea Tribe welfare Minister Sanjoy Kishan said. Assam has 33 Lakh children. According to National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2019-20, 9.1 per cent, 1 out of 10 children under the age of 5 are suffering from Severe Acute Malnourishment or SAM. Three out of 10 (32.8%) children are underweight; 6 out of 10 (65.9%) females between the age of 15 to 49 suffer from Anaemia. ""We leave home early morning, we cant keep track of what our children are eating, with meagre pay we cant ensure nutrition and we get back home late evening. Without good food our children have low immunity,"" said Anjana Jaal, a tea garden worker at Tinsukia's Chandmari tea estate. The vaccination status in Assam's 800 tea gardens is additional cause of concern --- of 10 lakh workers, only 55,000 have got both doses, while 6.5 lakh have got just one. Non-vaccinated minors, with low immunity in the tea gardens, have higher exposure to the virus -- so, the Poshan Maah drive's spotlight is on them. ""In the Poshan Maah camps, we identified the children with low nutrition level , 80-90 percent and transfered them nutrition to centre,"" said Nivedita Moran, Nutritionist.   The Poshan on Wheels drive was launched in 2018. In its fourth year, Assam has reinvented it, to deploy its findings on malnourishment against Covid as well. ""Our focus also has been to make them aware of good health and hygiene practices and we tell them rhat best is to grow and eat from your kitchen garden and eat green veggies, herbs,"" explains Rakhi Burman, an district Anganwadi Supervisor of Tinsukia."

The perennial fight over the procedure in America has become even more intense since Texas adopted a law on September 1 banning almost all abortions, unleashing a fierce counterattack in the courts and in Congress, but with few public demonstrations until now. Two days before the US Supreme Court, which will have the final say on the contentious issue, is due to reconvene, nearly 200 organizations have called on abortion rights defenders to make their voices heard from coast to coast. The flagship event was in the nation's capital Washington, where a crowd of all ages -- mostly women but men too -- rallied under sunny skies at a square near the White House, many wearing purple masks with the words ""bans off my body."" Protesters danced to pop music blared from loudspeakers, as activists addressed the crowd in recorded interviews broadcast on large screens, and slogans like ""abortion is healthcare"" or ""abort the Texas Taliban"" were held aloft on signs, or daubed on protesters' bodies. A handful of counter protesters shouted ""abortion is murder"" but there was no violence. Later the crowd was to march toward the Supreme Court, which nearly 50 years ago recognized the right of women to have an abortion in its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling. Now the court, stacked by former president Donald Trump with conservative justices, seems ready to head in the opposite direction. ""Women are humans, we are full humans, and we need to be treated like full humans,"" said Laura Bushwitz, a 66-year-old retired teacher from Florida, wearing a dress with portraits of women activists and politicians, like Michelle Obama. ""We should be able to have our own choice on what we want to do with our bodies. Period,"" she said. ""Hear that, SCOTUS,?"" she asked, referring to the US Supreme Court. The court has already refused to block the Texas law and has agreed to review a restrictive Mississippi law that could provide an opportunity to overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade precedent, that guaranteed the legal right to an abortion up until a fetus is viable outside the womb. Rallies were planned in at least two conservative states' capitals, Austin and Jackson, as well as in more than 600 cities in all 50 states. According to the organizers, nearly a quarter million people are expected to turn out across the United States. ""Together, we are joining hands to advocate for a country where abortion isn't just legal -- it's accessible, affordable and destigmatized,"" said the organizers of the Rally for Abortion Justice in a statement. The group called on Congress to enshrine the right to abortion in federal law, to protect it from any possible reversal by the Supreme Court. A bill to that effect was adopted a week ago in the House of Representatives, which is controlled by Democrats, but has no chance of passing the Senate where Republicans have enough votes to block it. 'Patriarchal Desire' In 2017, a first ""Women's March"" was held the day after Trump's inauguration, rallying millions of opponents of the Republican billionaire who had been accused of sexism. Since then, other demonstrations have failed to turn out such huge numbers, in part due to internal divisions over accusations of anti-Semitism leveled at one of the organizers. But that page seems to have been turned. Saturday's participants are a broad coalition including small feminist groups, community and local organizations as well as the giant of family planning, Planned Parenthood. ""We're taking to the streets once again, for the first time in the (Joe) Biden era,"" the statement said. ""Because a change in the Oval Office hasn't stopped the politicized, perverse, and patriarchal desire to regulate our bodies. If anything, it's only gotten even more intense."" That escalation has been spurred on by Trump's appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, emboldening local conservative elected officials across to the country to embark on an anti-abortion offensive. So far this year, 19 states have adopted 63 laws restricting access to abortions. If the high court were to overturn Roe v. Wade, every state would be free to ban or allow abortions.   That would mean 36 million women in 26 states -- nearly half of American women of reproductive age -- would likely lose the legal right to an abortion, according to a Planned Parenthood report released Friday.

A colourful event with a grand fire works display marked the formation of the new district. Releasing the Government Order announcing the formation of the new district, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said the Vijayanagara empire was not formed in a day, but was the outcome of the efforts of Hakka (also known as Harihara Raya) and Bukka Raya, Tungabhadra River and the blessings of saint Vidyaranya.

Twitter and other social media banned the former president from their platforms after a mob of pro-Trump supporters assaulted the US Congress building on January 6. They were riled up by a speech hours earlier in which Trump hammered away at his false claims that the election he lost to Joe Biden was stolen from him. Twitter said at the time that Trump tweets leading up to his removal violated its policy against glorifying violence and were likely to cause people to mimic what happened on January 6.   In the filing Friday in a Florida federal court, Trump argued that the platform that served as his main megaphone for reaching his millions of conservative followers was ""coerced"" into suspending him by members of the US Congress. At the time he was banned, Trump had more than 88 million Twitter followers. Twitter, the filing argues, ""exercises a degree of power and control over political discourse in this country that is immeasurable, historically unprecedented, and profoundly dangerous to open democratic debate."" The suit notes that the Taliban, in power in Afghanistan now and still considered a terrorist organization by the United States, is allowed to have a Twitter account. That account appeared on August 8 and ""over the weeks that followed Twitter allowed the Taliban to tweet regularly about their military conquests and victories across Afghanistan."" Banning Trump but not the Taliban amounts to ""ludicrous incongruity"" on the part of Twitter, the suit alleges. Contacted by AFP, Twitter declined to comment on Trump's move.   Trump continues to hold a tight grip on the Republican Party and after keeping a low profile for some months after the election, he has resumed holding election-style rallies, often dropping hints that he will run again for the White House in 2024.

Announcing the complete withdrawal of US troops in April, President Joe Biden vowed he would not allow a comeback of Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden hatched the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. Since then, the Pentagon has repeatedly claimed it is capable of keeping Al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) terrorists in Afghanistan in check through ""over-the-horizon"" strikes from US bases or aircraft carriers. ""Over-the-horizon operations are difficult but absolutely possible,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. ""And intelligence that supports them comes from a variety of sources, and not just US boots on the ground."" Austin's remarks came about two weeks after the Pentagon chief was forced to apologize to the relatives of civilians killed in an August 29 drone strike in Kabul. The target of the drone strike was suspected IS terrorists but it ended up killing 10 civilians, including seven children, in what Austin called a ""horrible mistake."" It was the latest in a long line of US drone strikes that caused civilian casualties in Afghanistan, becoming one of the most contentious issues over the 20-year war and prompting harsh criticism from Afghans. In his congressional testimony, Austin declined to publicly divulge much about the Pentagon's ""over-the-horizon"" plans, telling committee members he could provide more details in a closed classified session. 'Good Luck' A number of experts and lawmakers expressed skepticism about the efficacy of long distance strikes on land-locked Afghanistan, which is thousands of miles (kilometers) from the nearest US base. ""Kill Terrorists in Afghanistan From 'Over The Horizon'? Good Luck,"" headlined an article by James Holmes, a professor of maritime strategy at the Naval War College. ""Over-the-horizon operations work well when the battlefield lies within easy reach of sea or air forces,"" Holmes said in the piece published on the national security website 19fortyfive.com. ""Land-based aircraft flying from Persian Gulf airstrips must detour southward around hostile Iranian airspace, into the Arabian Sea, and northward through Pakistani airspace to strike targets in Afghanistan,"" said Holmes, a former US Navy officer. ""Carrier aircraft have it easier from a distance standpoint since their mobile airfield can linger in the Arabian Sea,"" he added. ""But even so, the Afghan capital of Kabul lies close to 700 miles from the closest point along the Pakistani seacoast,"" Holmes said. ""Inflight refueling will be a must."" 'A Fiction' Mike Waltz, a Republican lawmaker from Florida, accused Biden and Austin of peddling a ""fiction"" when it came to ""over-the-horizon"" capability. Unlike in Iraq, where US troops fought IS with Iraqi government forces, or Syria, where Americans partnered with Kurdish fighters, the United States does not have any allies on the ground in Afghanistan or any nearby bases, Waltz said.   ""Those drones have to fly all the way around Iran, all the way up Pakistan and lose 70 to 80 percent of their fuel before they even get anywhere near a target,"" said Waltz, a former US Army Green Beret who served in Afghanistan. ""The president of the United States is selling this country a fiction that we can do over here with nothing,"" Waltz said, pointing to Afghanistan on a map, ""what we're doing over here (in Iraq and Syria) with neighboring bases access, with allies on the ground and with ocean access."" ""That is a fiction that you all need to own,"" he added. In the early 2000s, the United States had military bases in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, but it is no longer present in Central Asia, which Russia considers its sphere of influence. General Mark Milley, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told lawmakers that he met recently in Europe with his Russian counterpart, General Valery Gerasimov. ""In the main, we're not asking permission -- negotiating, I guess, is the word,"" Milley said. ""President (Vladimir) Putin and President Biden had a conversation and I was following up on that conversation,"" he said. Andy Kim, a Democratic lawmaker from New Jersey, asked Austin, the Pentagon chief, whether US overflights of Afghanistan were legal.   ""Yes,"" Austin replied, adding that he would provide further details in a classified setting. The Taliban this week accused the United States of violating international law with drone flights over Afghan territory and warned of ""negative consequences"" if they continued."

Delivering a lecture at an industry chamber on Thursday, Gen Naravane had said the ""unprecedented"" military standoff with China required an immediate response and large-scale mobilisation of resources at a time when the country was faced with the coronavirus pandemic. ""The unprecedented developments necessitated large scale resource mobilisation, orchestration of forces and immediate response, all this in a Covid-infested environment,"" he said. The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year in eastern Ladakh following a violent clash in the Pangong lake area. Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry. As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the Gogra area last month. In February, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in line with an agreement on disengagement.   Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in the sensitive sector.

The Sputnik V shot, widely used in Russia and approved for use in over 70 countries, is undergoing a review by the WHO and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Their approval could open up new markets for the shot, especially in Europe. Murashko has met WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Geneva. ""Russia's position on promotion and registration of the Sputnik V vaccine was heard, we have removed all the questions for today,"" Murashko was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency. He said that the company which is dealing with Sputnik V registration at WHO only ""has to sign a few documents, submit a few additional papers"". The WHO could not be immediately reached for comment.   The WHO said in July its review of how Russia produces the Sputnik V vaccine had found some issues with the filling of vials at a plant. The manufacturer said it had since addressed all of the WHO's concerns. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

""No one on Earth can dare to doubt the patriotism of the Muslim people in Lakshadweep. No one can put a question mark on the patriotism of the people of Lakshadweep,"" Mr Singh said during his speech on the occasion of the 152nd birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He was addressing the people after unveiling a statue of Mahatma Gandhi. Singh, during the event, also spoke on the issue of climate change and how global warming and resulting rise in ocean levels pose a threat to the existence of Lakshadweep. He said that as part of the government's ""positive attitude"" towards reduction of carbon emissions, the Prime Minister has decided to ban manufacture, sale and usage of single use plastics and related products from July 1 next year. He also said that cleanliness on land should also include cleaning of the oceans and this has been emphasised upon by the PM. ""The marine ecosystem has to be kept clean,"" he added. On the issue of anti-India forces attempting to foment trouble in the island, Mr Singh said that due to the strategic location and importance of the island archipelago, such attempts have been made in the past and even now, but efforts of such entities were unsuccessful because of the islanders. He further said that there were attempts to promote extremism, radicalism and terrorism in Lakshadweep, but all these efforts failed and for that he congratulated the people of the island union territory. He also said that the BJP government at the Centre has taken a strict stance against terrorism, which was evident from its ""cross-border"" actions against terrorists. However, where radicalisation was concerned, the government has not taken such a hard stance and has instead opted for ""counselling"" to bring those radicalised back into the mainstream. The Defence Minister said the people of the island were true followers of Mahatma Gandhi's principles as there was no hatred amongst them on the basis of caste, creed or religion. He said that even the present BJP government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was totally against any discrimination on the basis of caste, creed and religion. However, ""some vested interests"" have been projecting the present central government as ""anti-minority"", which was ""incorrect"" and a ""false allegation"", the Union minister said. He said the aim of the present government at the Centre was ""justice for all and appeasement of none"". The central government and the PM were also focused on ""uplift of the poor and marginalised"" sections of society and empowering them. He said that while the island may be thousands of kilometers away from Delhi, the people living there are not far from the hearts of the central government and this message was coming not just from him, but also from the Prime Minister. Mr Singh said this was evident from the development work being planned and carried out in the island and said any shortcoming in it should be brought to the Centre's attention. Outlining the Centre's plans for the island, he said Lakshadweep will be turned into the next Maldives, which has a unique identity of its own in the world.   Mr Singh said that Lakshadweep too would soon have a unique identity of its own in the world and for that development work in the island was being expedited. As part of the development work, the administration of the Union Territory was taking steps to realise the islands' tourism potential, he said and congratulated the administrator - Praful Khoda Patel - for his efforts."

The meeting between Mr Choubey and the Haryana Chief Minister today came hours after massive protests erupted outside Mr Khattar's home in Karnal district. Between 1,000 and 1,500 angry farmers were protesting the delayed purchase of their crops and signalled their intention to camp overnight.  Visuals from the area showed farmers, who were briefly doused with water cannons, standing on a pile of yellow police barricades and shouting angrily, while a handful of security forces in riot gear look on. Protests in Haryana's Yamunanagar also turned violent after protesters broke police barricades near the residence of state minister Kanwar Pal. In Punjab, protesters also gathered outside the residence of newly-inducted minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa in Gurdaspur and MLA Brahm Mohindra. ""We will take the paddy produced by us to the residence of the Chief Minister because he had said we can sell our produce anywhere as per the new law.

Crop procurement in India is undertaken by the centre's Food Corporation of India, which works in tandem with state-level agencies. Paddy procurement usually starts from October 1.

A city civil court granted permission to the IPS officer to wear on the last day of his service, the bloodstained cap and name badge that he wore on duty when the former Prime Minister was assassinated. Prateep V Phillip then served as Additional Superintendent of Police, Kancheepuram, and survived the human bomb blast that killed Mr Gandhi and others. Prateep V Phillip sustained injuries in the incident and due to the impact of the blast, his cap and name badge fell down. Since then, his cap and badge, which were part of the evidence from the scene of crime, collected by the Special Investigation Team (SIT), had remained in the custody of the trial court. Few days before his retirement, he moved the First Additional Sessions Court seeking permission to take possession of the cap and name badge, as they were of ""immense sentimental value"" to him. The First Additional Sessions judge T Chandrsekharan on September 28, granted permission for interim custody, on own bond of ₹ one lakh and ordered they should be handed over to the court on or before October 28 after the purpose was fulfilled. The officer retired on September 30. The cap and badge literally symbolised his blood, sweat and tears of his professional career which spanned about 34 years, the court further noted. ""Holding the cap and badge, in my capacity, at the closure of 34 years of service life, symbolises the trauma I went through, the exhilaration, the law, sadness - a cocktail of emotions. I was the only person on the planet who underwent the ordeal,"" Mr Phillip, who retired on Thursday as Director General of Police (DGP), Training, told PTI. The tragedy has transformed his life and perspective so much he resolved to dedicate his entire service life for the cause of the people.   ""Your life gets transformed and your perspective undergoes changes. The incident (assassination) made me think of what I can do for the people. This changed my career and I never aspired for position or power, but consistently involved in equipping and encouraging people,"" Prateep V Phillip said, adding his sole goal in his service life was to humanise the police force. ""Now taking stock after over three decades in service, I still find the Friends of Police (FoP) methodology and concept that I launched (in 1993) transforming countries across geographies,"" he claimed. His colleagues appreciated his innovative concept of FoP and said it worked very well."

The arrest comes a day after the Congress served a show-cause notice to the three-time MLA from Baghbar justified the killing of eight people in Darrang district around 40 years ago at the same area where last week's eviction drive took place. He called the eight people, seen as martyrs of agitation in the Assamese society, ""murderers"". Mr Ahmed apparently made the remarks while reacting to reports that said alleged encroachers in Darrang district disrespected the memory of those who died during the 1983 Assam agitation. His comment has evoked strong reactions across Assam and multiple FIRs have been filed against him. The Congress while issuing the show-cause notice said the MLA issued the statements ""with the intention of damaging the party's image"" ahead of the bypolls in the state. It also added that the ""insensitive"" statements made by him have ""great propensity"" to destroy the social harmony of the state.   On September 20, the Darrang district authorities began evictions at four places in Dholpur, about 9 km from Sipajhar, and nearly 800 families - most of whom were Bengali-speaking Muslims - were removed from 4,500 bighas of land the government claimed ownership for. The drive, however, turned violent, leaving at least two persons dead in police firing and several others injured in clashes."

Mr Surjewala's remarks came as Amarinder Singh had accused the Congress leadership of ""humiliating"" him after he tendered his resignation as the Punjab Chief Minister. Amarinder Singh was replaced by Charanjit Singh Channi after the Congress chose him as the new legislative party leader last month. Congress general secretary Surjewala said when any chief minister loses the confidence of all of his legislators, he should not remain in his post. ""Seventy-eight out of 79 legislators (in Punjab) had written for a change of the chief minister. Had we not changed the CM, you would have accused us of being a dictator.

""Sonia Gandhi is the president of the Congress party and the decision on changing the CM in Punjab was not taken by her. As I told you, 78 MLAs had written and then we changed the CM,"" added Mr Surjewala. Notably, Amarinder Singh had earlier rejected the charge of the Congress leadership that he had lost the confidence of the MLAs. The former chief minister had said he would quit the Congress which he had asserted was going downhill with senior leaders being ignored. Mr Surjewala said it was for the first time in Punjab a person belonging to the Scheduled Caste community became chief minister and a new history was created. He questioned the BJP whether they have any chief minister belonging to the Supreme Court. ""If the Congress has made a move, what is their problem?"" he asked the BJP.

Beijing marked its National Day on Friday with its biggest aerial show of force against Taiwan to date, buzzing the self-ruled democratic island with 38 warplanes, including nuclear-capable H-6 bombers. Democratic Taiwan's 23 million people live under the constant threat of invasion by China which views the island as its territory and has vowed to one day seize it, by force if necessary. Under President Xi Jinping, Chinese warplanes are crossing into Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) on a near daily basis. But Friday's incursion sparked a particularly sharp rebuke from Taipei. ""China has been bellicose and damaging regional peace while engaging in many bullying acts,"" Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters Saturday. ""It's evident that the world, the international community, rejects such behaviours by China more and more."" Taiwan's defence ministry said it scrambled its aircraft to broadcast warnings after 22 fighters, two bombers and one anti-submarine aircraft entered the island's southwest ADIZ on Friday. A second batch of 13 jets then crossed into Taiwan's ADIZ later on Friday, in a rare night incursion, bringing the total to a record 38, according to the ministry. That was followed by a further incursion on Saturday by 20 planes. The ADIZ is not the same as Taiwan's territorial airspace but includes a far greater area that overlaps with part of China's own air defence identification zone and even includes some of mainland China. Rising Tensions Mass incursions used to be rare. But in the last two years Beijing has begun sending large sorties into Taiwan's ADIZ to signal dissatisfaction at key moments -- and to keep Taipei's ageing fighter fleet regularly stressed. Last week, 24 Chinese warplanes flew into the area after Taiwan applied to join a major trans-Pacific trade pact. Friday's show of force came the same week Beijing accused Britain of ""evil attentions"" after it sent a frigate to sail through the Taiwan Strait. China claims the strait as its own waterway, along with most of the disputed South China Sea. Most other nations view them as international waters open to all. Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taipei since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, who has said she views the island as ""already independent"" and not part of a ""one China"". Last year, Chinese military jets made a record 380 incursions into Taiwan's defence zone, and the number of breaches for the first nine months of this year has already exceeded 500. The previous single-day record was on June 15 when 28 jets breached Taiwan's ADIZ. Xi has described Taiwan becoming part of the mainland as ""inevitable"". US military officials have begun to talk openly about fears that China could consider the previously unthinkable and invade. Protection of Taiwan has become a rare bipartisan issue in Washington and a growing number of Western nations have begun joining the United States in ""freedom of navigation"" exercises to push back on China's claims to the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. Britain sent a warship through the Taiwan Strait on Monday for the first time since 2008. The Chinese People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command accused Britain of acting out of ""evil intentions to sabotage peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"". Alexander Huang, associate professor at Tamkang University in Taipei, said he believed the latest aerial incursion was not just about sending a message to Taiwan. ""There's three other carrier attack groups in the region, two American and one British,"" he told AFP. ""China is sending a political message to the US and UK on her national day: Don't mess around in my area.""   Canadian, French and Australian warships have all made voyages through the Taiwan Strait in recent years, sparking protests from China.

The updated travel advisory by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) noted an additional COVID-19 test on day eight and a 10-day mandatory quarantine for all travellers going to India from Britain from Monday. The advisory was updated a day after the government announced that all British nationals arriving in India from the UK will have to undergo a mandatory 10-day quarantine from Monday irrespective of their vaccination status as part of a reciprocal action against the UK's new international travel rules with similar measures for Indians. “The Indian authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry into India. We are in close contact with them, and will update FCDO Travel Advice on GOV.UK with the latest information on any changes to the rules,” a UK government spokesperson said. The updated FCDO advisory states that all travellers irrespective of their vaccination status arriving in India must undertake a Covid-19 RT-PCR test on arrival at airport and on day eight after arrival, at their own cost, and undergo mandatory quarantine at home or at the destination address for 10 days. “All such passengers under isolation/quarantine shall be regularly monitored by State/District Health Authorities,” the advisory noted. The move follows India's vaccine certification not yet being officially recognised by the UK, requiring vaccinated Indian travellers to Britain to undergo the same level of PCR tests and quarantine restrictions as unvaccinated travellers from Monday when England's new travel norms come into force. UK government sources said on Saturday that the extension of vaccine certification to additional countries will be reviewed approximately every three weeks and that it continues to engage with the Indian government on the issue. “The UK is continuing to work on expanding the policy to countries and territories across the globe in a phased approach. We are continuing to engage with the government of India on technical cooperation to expand UK recognition of vaccine certification to people vaccinated by a relevant public health body in India,” sources said. “We are working with an array of international partners and look forward to continuing the expansion of the policy to countries and territories across the globe in a phased approach. Extension of vaccine certification will be reviewed approximately every three weeks,” they added. According to UK officials, decisions on vaccine recognition are made by ministers, taking into account public health factors. They said the UK is looking at expanding the role that vaccination can play more widely for those who have been fully vaccinated elsewhere to enter the UK. The UK has reiterated that it remains committed to opening up international travel again as soon as it is practicable and the extension of vaccine certification is a further step to enable people to travel more freely again, in a safe and sustainable way, while protecting public health. From Monday, England's traffic light system of red, amber and green countries based on levels of COVID-19 risk officially ends. However, despite India-manufactured Covishield recognised within the UK's eligible vaccine formulations and being the predominant vaccine used in India, it would not offer any advantage to vaccinated Indian travellers planning a UK visit.   The Indian government had expressed its strong condemnation of such a move and warned of “reciprocal measures” if vaccinated travellers from India continued to be treated in a ""discriminatory"" way.

The queen opened the Scottish parliament on Saturday with fond remarks, four months after an election that returned a pro-independence majority pledging to hold a new referendum on whether to leave the United Kingdom. Next month, Britain will host the COP26 climate summit in Scotland, which British officials bill as the last chance for world leaders to commit to firm targets to reduce emissions for the next decade and avert catastrophic global warming. ""The eyes of the world will be on the United Kingdom - and Scotland in particular - as leaders come together to address the challenges of climate change,"" Elizabeth said in a speech. ""There is a key role for the Scottish Parliament, as with all parliaments, to help create a better, healthier future for us all, and to engage with the people they represent, especially our young people."" Elizabeth will attend COP26 events. Her family including son Prince Charles and grandson Prince William have long been vocal campaigners on a host of environmental issues. The 95-year-old monarch, who lives for some of the year at her Scottish estate, spoke fondly of her time there with Prince Philip, her husband of 70 years who died in April. ""I have spoken before of my deep and abiding affection for this wonderful country, and of the many happy memories Prince Philip and I always held of our time here,"" she said. Though Scottish independence is considered a political issue on which the queen should not take a public position, her warm words for Scotland are sometimes portrayed in the media as part of a charm offensive to help persuade Scots to stay.   Scotland has been part of the United Kingdom for more than 300 years. Since 1999, it has had its own parliament and devolved administration responsible for most domestic policies.

Pointing to ""conflicting numbers"" shared by the party's Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat and senior leader Randeep Surjewala on a purported letter received by the Congress's central leadership expressing lack of confidence against him, Amarinder Singh termed it ""a comedy of errors."" The former Chief Minister's remarks came after Mr Surjewala claimed that 78 of the 79 Punjab Congress MLAs had written to the party leadership seeking Amarinder Singh's ouster. ""Interestingly, just a day earlier, Harish Rawat had, in a press statement, said that 43 MLAs had written to the high command on the issue,"" Amarinder Singh said in a statement. ""It seems the entire party has become imbued with Navjot Singh Sidhu's sense of comic theatrics,"" he said. ""Next, they will claim that 117 MLAs wrote to them against me."" ""This is the state of affairs in the party. They cannot even coordinate their lies properly,"" Captain Amarinder said, adding the Congress was in a total state of disarray, and the crisis seemed to be escalating by the day, with a large majority of its senior leaders completely disenchanted with the party's functioning. ""The fact of the matter was that the 43-odd MLAs who had signed the said letter had been forced to do so under duress,"" Amarinder Singh said. Amarinder Singh's outburst that he was not treated well by the party is not true, the Congress said on Friday. ""It is being said that he was humiliated. I would like to clarify that the party has always given him respect and treated him with high regard,"" Mr Rawat told reporters on Friday, amid the spiralling crisis in the Punjab Congress that started with Amarinder Singh's resignation as Chief Minister just days ago. Amarinder Singh has said he would quit Congress for humiliating him. The Congress leader shocked the party when he went to meet BJP leader and Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi, raising speculation that he might join the BJP. But he has ruled out joining any party, and said he met Mr Shah to discuss farm laws.   Amarinder Singh's tactical move whose outcome is still unknown comes after persistent gnawing by a section of Congress MLAs seeking a leadership change in the state ahead of assembly election next year. Just two months ago, Navjot Singh Sidhu was made the Punjab Congress chief despite objections by Amarinder Singh, who also openly made it known he would oppose any attempt by the party leadership to consider Mr Sidhu for the top post. ""Having been pushed into a corner over its mishandling of the Punjab crisis, the Congress was now in a total state of panic, which was evident in the statements of its leaders... The panic-stricken party, grappling with internal chaos, was trying hard to shift the blame of its own failures. It's sad to see the way they are resorting to blatant lies to justify their wrongdoings,"" Amarinder Singh said in the statement on Saturday."

The Chief Minister had said on Thursday that the visit by Congress MLAs to Delhi should not be seen through the prism of politics.

His remarks came at an interaction with Gram Panchayats and Pani Samitis or Village Water and Sanitation Committees (VWSC) on Jal Jeevan Mission today through video conferencing. Speaking on the occasion, PM Modi said, ""This is a village-driven and women-driven movement. Its main base is a mass movement and public participation. On the Jal Jeevan Mission app, every detail regarding this movement will be available in one place."" He further said, ""I am happy that on this day, people from lakhs of villages across the country are conducting Jal Jeevan Samvad through 'Gram Sabhas'. Jal Jeevan Mission is not only to make water accessible to the people. It's also a big movement of decentralization."" PM Modi, who also virtually launched the Rashtriya Jal Jeevan Kosh and Jal Jeevan Mission mobile application, said that the water quality monitoring and surveillance via the Jal Jeevan Mission App will help maintain the water quality across the nation. Pani Samitis play a key role in planning, implementation, management, operation and maintenance of village water supply systems, thereby providing clean tap water to every household on a regular and long-term basis. Out of over six lakh villages, Pani Samitis or VWSCs have been constituted in around 3.5 lakh villages. More than 7.1 lakh women have been trained to test the quality of water by using field test kits. On August 15, 2019, the Prime Minister announced the Jal Jeevan Mission to provide clean tap water to every household. At the time of the launch of the mission, only 3.23 crore (17 per cent) rural households had a tap water supply. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, in the last two years, more than five crore households have been provided with tap water connections. As of date, about 8.26 crore (43 per cent) rural households have tap water supply in their homes. Every rural household in 78 districts, 58 thousand Gram Panchayats and 1.16 lakh villages are getting tap water supply. Till now, tap water supply has been provided in 7.72 lakh (76 per cent) schools and 7.48 lakh (67.5 per cent) anganwadi centres. To realize the Prime Minister's vision of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas', and following the 'bottom up' approach, Jal Jeevan Mission is implemented in partnership with states with a budget of ₹ 3.6 lakh crore.   Further, ₹ 1.42 lakh crore has been allocated to PRIs (Panchayati Raj Institutions) as a tied grant under the 15th Finance Commission for water and sanitation in villages for the period 2021-22 to 2025-26.

""As per decision taken, the Haryana has government has assured that paddy procurement will start from tomorrow (Sunday). They have made everything ready. Procurement in Punjab is already in process... from tomorrow both states will begin buying,"" he said. ""Due to delay in monsoon, the central government had postponed start of procurement of paddy and millet to October 11 from October 1 this year... There are demands for an early start. The procurement will start tomorrow,"" Mr Khattar confirmed. Yesterday, new Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Channi met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi to discuss the farm laws and ask the centre to start buying paddy and millet. The meeting between Mr Choubey and the Haryana Chief Minister today came hours after massive protests erupted outside Mr Khattar's home in Karnal district. Between 1,000 and 1,500 angry farmers were protesting the delayed purchase of their crops and signalled their intention to camp overnight.  Visuals from the area showed farmers, who were briefly doused with water cannons, standing on a pile of yellow police barricades and shouting angrily, while a handful of security forces in riot gear look on. Protests in Haryana's Yamunanagar also turned violent after protesters broke police barricades near the residence of state minister Kanwar Pal. In Punjab, protesters also gathered outside the residence of newly-inducted minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa in Gurdaspur and MLA Brahm Mohindra. ""We will take the paddy produced by us to the residence of the Chief Minister because he had said we can sell our produce anywhere as per the new law. Thus, we have planned to sell it today in front of his house,"" Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, a farmer union leader, was quoted by news agency ANI. Yesterday farmer leader Rakesh Tikait warned of these protests. ""To demand paddy procurement, farmers will protest outside the homes of BJP-JJP MLAs (in Haryana) and the office of the collector in Punjab tomorrow,"" he had tweeted. The centre had earlier postponed procurement of paddy till October 11 citing delays in maturity of the crop due to the recent heavy rainfall. Crop procurement in India is undertaken by the centre's Food Corporation of India, which works in tandem with state-level agencies. Paddy procurement usually starts from October 1. The Congress (in the opposition in Haryana and in power in Punjab) had warned the centre that a large amount of paddy would go to waste if not picked soon. ""Lakhs of quintals of paddy had already started to arrive in mandis from September 20. Eleven days have passed since then but so far not a single grain has been procured (at MSP) in Haryana,"" Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala was quoted by news agency PTI. He said earlier paddy procurement was to start on September 25 in Haryana. Mr Surjewala also said around 20 lakh quintals of paddy were lying unsupervised in mandis. ""In Ambala 4.5 lakh quintal paddy has arrived... in Kurukshetra 5.5 lakh quintal... in Yamunanagar 2.25 lakh quintal... in Kaithal 2 lakh quintal and in Karnal 1.75 lakh,"" he said, and accused the ruling BJP of ""a clear conspiracy to end paddy procurement at MSP"". Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has hailed the farmers ""big victory"" and called on the centre to also take back the farm laws. ""Big victory of the farmers' struggle... government took back the decision to postpone purchase of paddy by 10 days. I appeal to the government to now take back the three black laws and guarantee MSP,"" he tweeted. Farmers in Haryana, Punjab and other states have been protesting the centre's controversial farm laws, which they say will eventually do away with the MSP, or minimum support prices, system, which is the minimum guaranteed price at which the centre buys their crops. The centre has said the laws will not affect MSPs and has refused to rule out their repeal.   Multiple rounds of talks have failed to break the deadlock. With input from ANI, PTI"

Among MLAs seen at the Chhattisgarh airport were Shishupal Sori, Santram Netam, Kismat Lal, Ram Kumar Yadav, Kawasi Lakhma and KK Dhruv. Santram Netam said that he was going to Delhi for ""personal reason"" and the presence of other MLAs at the airport was merely a coincidence. He added that any meeting with senior party leaders will be a part of the routine they follow when they visit the national capital. Another MLA Kismat Lal said he was going to meet his daughter who is studying in Delhi. Asked about the issue of change in the state chief minister, Mr Lal said that Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel was doing ""good work"" in the state and there should not be any change in the leadership. Earlier on Wednesday, more than a dozen Chhattisgarh Congress MLAs landed in Delhi to extend their support to Mr Baghel for the chief minister post. However, Mr Baghel on Thursday said that the MLAs' visit did not have a political objective. ""The MLAs can't even go anywhere? If someone has gone there, it shouldn't be seen from a political angle. If a politician is going somewhere, it's obvious that he'll meet political persons only. PL Punia isn't in Delhi, how can anyone meet him there?"" said Mr Baghel. Chhattisgarh Health Minister TS Singh Deo has been demanding a change of guard in the state. After the Bhupesh Baghel-led government completed two-and-a-half years in office in June, the supporters of TS Singh Deo raised the issue of rotational chief ministership.   Congress won the assembly polls held in December 2018 with a thumping majority. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

(I) will stand by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra"". Mr Sidhu - backed by the Gandhi family in his bitter feud with former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh (whose resignation last month precipitated a leadership crisis in the state) - also vowed to ""uphold the principles of Gandhiji and Shastriji"" and said he remained committed to ensuring a Congress victory. ""Will uphold principles of Gandhiji and Shastriji... Post or no post will stand by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi! Let all negative forces try to defeat me, but with every ounce of positive energy will make Punjab win, Punjabiyat (Universal Brotherhood) win and every Punjabi win!!"" he tweeted. On Thursday sources said Mr Sidhu, who has received strong support from Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in particular (she convinced Rahul Gandhi to meet the ex-India cricketer in July), would remain as President of the Congress' Punjab unit, days after he quit over ""no compromise"" claims. He had reportedly been angered by certain appointments made by new Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, including those to the Advocate-General and Punjab Police chief's posts. The U-turn came after a late-night conversation between Mr Channi and the sulking Mr Sidhu. ""The Congress leadership understands Navjot Sidhu, and Sidhu is not beyond the Congress leadership. He is not Amarinder Singh, who never cared for the Congress and its leadership,"" the former cricketer's advisor, Mohammad Mustafa, declared. The Sidhu-Amarinder feud exploded last month after Mr Singh declared himself ""humiliated thrice"" by the Congress' leadership and quit as Chief Minister. He later also warned the ""Gandhi children"" - a reference to Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra - were ""quite inexperienced"" and their advisors were clearly misguiding them. Mr Sidhu had hoped to be Mr Singh's replacement, but the party high command chose Mr Channi.   Instead, Mr Sidhu was chosen to lead the party's state unit, amid speculation he would eventually replace Amarinder Singh, a veteran of over four decades, as the Congress' face for the election. A furious Amarinder Singh has vowed to do everything he can to prevent Mr Sidhu - whom he has called ""not a stable man and not fit for the border state of Punjab"" - from becoming Chief Minister."

Remembering Lal Bahadur Shastri, Mr Bommai said he was a symbol of simple living, who had set high standards of leading a public life.

The grim threshold comes with an average of well over 1,000 dying each day, in a country where 55.7 percent of the population is now fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After a heavily criticized early response to the pandemic, the United States has since organized among the world's most effective vaccine roll-outs. But it nonetheless finds itself having notched the most fatalities in the world, far exceeding other frontrunners such as Brazil and India, and facing a resurgence in cases due to the prominence of the highly contagious Delta variant. While the latest global coronavirus wave peaked in late August, the virus continues to spread rapidly, particularly in the United States. The vaccination campaign launched by US authorities in December -- which had reached a peak in April, with sometimes more than four million injections per day -- has meanwhile slowed considerably. Masking remains a political issue in much of the country, dividing many Americans. Some Republican governors, such as those in Texas and Florida, have sought to ban mandatory masking in their states, citing individual freedoms. The Democratic state of California on the other hand announced on Friday that Covid vaccinations will be compulsory for all students. In Washington, hundreds of thousands of white flags fluttered on the grass on the National Mall, not far from the White House, as somber reminders of those who have died of Covid in the United States.

At the moment, we are quite well poised to meet any eventuality,"" he said, adding he doubts ""any aggression can be shown in any area"". On achieving disengagement through dialogue, General Naravane said: ""By and by, all friction points will get resolved. I am of the firm opinion that we can resolve our differences through dialogue. I am hopeful we will be able to achieve results. We're hopeful of having the 13th round of talks in the second week of October and reaching a consensus on how disengagement will take place."" On Friday, the General took stock of operational preparedness in Eastern Ladakh. An Army spokesperson said he visited several forward areas and was briefed on the current security situation. The Army said he also interacted with the troops and complimented them on their resoluteness and high morale. The Army has deployed the first K9-Vajra self-propelled howitzer regiment in the Ladakh sector, along the Line of Actual Control, the de-facto border with China. The gun can strike enemy targets at a distance of around 50 km. ""These guns can also work in high-altitude areas; field trials were extremely successful. We have now added an entire regiment, this will be really helpful,"" the Army Chief told ANI today.   India and China have been locked in a stand-off for more than a year.  Twenty Indian soldiers died in the line of duty amid clashes with Chinese troops last year in June. (With inputs from ANI) "

On the question of negative press about his decisions, the Prime Minister said he attaches ""big importance"" to criticism. ""Imagine if our country had not come up with a vaccine. What would be the situation? We know that a large population of the world doesn't have access to Covid vaccines. Today, our success in vaccination is thanks to India being atmanirbhar,"" PM Modi said in an interview to Open magazine. Sixty-nine per cent of the country's adult population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and 25 per cent has taken both doses, the government said earlier this week. It aims to inoculate all eligible population by December-end. PM Modi said most people only level allegations as they lack the time to study the issue, while criticism is rooted in research. ""I, with an honest mind, respect critics a lot. But, unfortunately, the number of critics is very low. Mostly, people only level allegations, the people who play games about perception are more in number. And the reason for this is that , for criticism, one has to do a lot of hard work, research and, in today's fast-paced world, may be people don't have time. So sometimes, I miss critics,"" he added. ""We need to look at the entire logistics, planning and progress to understand the success of the vaccine drive. It is a huge effort with so many people mobilised across the country. I hope the media will take time out to highlight the efforts of our people in making the world's largest vaccination drive a stunning success,"" the PM told the magazine. The Prime Minister spotlighted how at a science conference a few years ago he suggested it was time to move away from ""Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan"" and work on the mantra of ""Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, Jai Anusandhan (research)"". He said his government gives top priority to research. ""We started planning for the vaccination drive right in May 2020 when no vaccine was even close to approval anywhere in the world. We had decided as early as then that we did not want this vaccination drive to run in the old way where it could take decades to vaccinate people. We wanted this to run in a fast, efficient, discretion-free and timebound manner,"" said the Prime Minister. Two vaccines for coronavirus: Covishield, which has been developed by British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is manufactured in India by Pune-based Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin, developed by homegrown Bharat Biotech, received emergency approval from the country's drug regulator at the start of this year. Elaborating his point, the Prime Minister said the poor today does not have to wait or pay a bribe to avail services he deserves. A poor migrant, said PM Modi, can take his second dose of vaccine in the city he works in, even if he took the first dose in his village. Technology ensures he gets the right vaccine at the right time and seamlessly, the Prime Minister said. ""When we compare India's situation in the world, we have done better than many developed countries. However, we have in our midst vested interests whose only aim is to tarnish India's name. COVID-19 was a global scourge with all countries equally affected. In this scenario, India has done better that its peers and many developed countries, notwithstanding such negative campaigns,"" he said. Reeling off numbers and his government's focus on healthcare, the Prime Minister said from six All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in 2014, the nation is now building 22 such institutes; from 380 medical colleges in 2014, there are now around 560 such colleges. The government is also working on launching a massive scheme to boost health infrastructure that will address a lot of legacy issues, said the Prime Minister. ""We are actively focusing on preventive healthcare. From improved sanitation to water supply, from yoga to Ayurveda, from strengthening diagnostic centres in remote areas, we are doing it all,"" he stressed. PM Modi credited the country for its ability to unite, come together and deliver in this hour of grave crisis. ""From being a net importer of PPE kits, we have now become one of the biggest manufacturers across the globe. Similarly, we not only managed to exponentially increase the number of ventilators but also did so largely through domestic manufacturing. India achieved this despite limited global knowledge about the virus, the economic impact of lockdown and existing state capacity constraints. Is there any better evidence of our ability to bring transformative change?"" asked PM Modi.   On the criticism against the banging of thalis and lighting diyas, the Prime Minister said there was a need to boost the morale of healthcare and frontline workers. He said the event turned into a big mass movement. "

(I) will stand by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra"". Mr Sidhu - backed by the Gandhi family in his bitter feud with former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh (whose resignation last month precipitated a leadership crisis in the state) - also vowed to ""uphold the principles of Gandhiji and Shastriji"" and said he remained committed to ensuring a Congress victory. ""Will uphold principles of Gandhiji and Shastriji... Post or no post will stand by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi! Let all negative forces try to defeat me, but with every ounce of positive energy will make Punjab win, Punjabiyat (Universal Brotherhood) win and every Punjabi win!!"" he tweeted. On Thursday sources said Mr Sidhu, who has received strong support from Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in particular (she convinced Rahul Gandhi to meet the ex-India cricketer in July), would remain as President of the Congress' Punjab unit, days after he quit over ""no compromise"" claims. He had reportedly been angered by certain appointments made by new Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, including those to the Advocate-General and Punjab Police chief's posts. The U-turn came after a late-night conversation between Mr Channi and the sulking Mr Sidhu. ""The Congress leadership understands Navjot Sidhu, and Sidhu is not beyond the Congress leadership. He is not Amarinder Singh, who never cared for the Congress and its leadership,"" the former cricketer's advisor, Mohammad Mustafa, declared. The Sidhu-Amarinder feud exploded last month after Mr Singh declared himself ""humiliated thrice"" by the Congress' leadership and quit as Chief Minister. He later also warned the ""Gandhi children"" - a reference to Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra - were ""quite inexperienced"" and their advisors were clearly misguiding them. Mr Sidhu had hoped to be Mr Singh's replacement, but the party high command chose Mr Channi.   Instead, Mr Sidhu was chosen to lead the party's state unit, amid speculation he would eventually replace Amarinder Singh, a veteran of over four decades, as the Congress' face for the election. A furious Amarinder Singh has vowed to do everything he can to prevent Mr Sidhu - whom he has called ""not a stable man and not fit for the border state of Punjab"" - from becoming Chief Minister."

""Lawyers dedicated to a particular cause can devote themselves to legal aid services in that domain. For example, in the #MeToo movement young women lawyers assisted women who faced sexual harassment,"" Justice Chandrachud said during an event today. ""The Bar Council of India could perhaps introduce a clause for the renewal of practice of advocates... a certain number of pro-bono cases. That would go a long way in adding to legal aid,"" he added. ""Other categories like transgenders face social stigma, are shunned by their own families. It's hard for them to access legal aid. If there are lawyers who specialise in those cases... they could help with legal aid to them,"" Justice Chandrachud underlined. Justice DY Chandrachud made these remarks at the launch of ""Pan India Legal Awareness and Outreach Campaign"" by National Legal Services Authority (NALSA). The campaign will run for six weeks across India and is aimed at creating awareness about legal aid services even in remote corners of the country. Justice SK Kaul, also a judge in Supreme Court supported Justice Chandrachud's suggestions. He said, ""Marginalised people still face barriers in accessing legal services. There are issues of both accessibility and affordability. Especially because in so many cases the legal proceedings go on for years. Justice Chandrachud's idea could help in resolving such issues for several sections of people."" The #MeToo movement is one of the most powerful feminist campaigns of the decade that saw women worldwide, including celebrities and activists, using the hashtag #MeToo to shun the stigma around being a sexual abuse survivor using social media.    The movement caught momentum in 2017 amid sex abuse allegations against American film producer Harvey Weinstein. The global campaign, which has also found tremendous support in India, focuses on the healing of sexual survivors, awareness about the legal fight and the struggle they face amid the stigma.

Mohib Ullah, who was in his late 40s, was killed by unknown gunmen in a camp in Cox's Bazar on Wednesday night. He led one of the largest community groups to emerge since more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar after a military crackdown in August 2017. ""The government will take stern action against those who were involved in the killing. No one will be spared,"" Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said in his first comment since the killing. Momen said in a statement that ""vested"" interests were responsible for the killing as Mohib Ullah had wanted to return to Myanmar. ""The killers of Mohib Ullah must be brought to justice."" Mohib Ullah was known as a moderate who advocated for the Rohingya to return to Myanmar with rights they were denied during decades of persecution. He was the leader of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights, founded in 2017 to document atrocities against Rohingya in their native Myanmar and give them a voice in international talks about their future. But his high profile made him a target of hardliners and he received death threats, he told Reuters in 2019. ""If I die, I'm fine. I will give my life,"" he said at the time. The killing has ignited grief and anger in the camps, the world's largest refugee settlement, where some residents interviewed by Reuters say the killing is the latest evidence of mounting violence as armed gangs and extremists vie for power. In a video circulated on social media, his brother, Habib Ullah, who said he witnessed the shooting, blamed the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, an armed group active in the camps. ""They killed him as he is the leader and all Rohingya abide by him,"" Habib Ullah said. Before opening fire, ""They said he cannot be a leader of Rohingya and there cannot be any leaders for Rohingya,"" he said. Reuters could not independently verify his account. ARSA said in a post on Twitter on Friday that it was ""shocked and saddened"" by the killing and decried ""finger-pointing with baseless and hearsay accusations"". More than a million Rohingya live in the camps, the vast majority having fled neighbouring Myanmar during a military crackdown after the coup that the United Nations has said was carried out with genocidal intent.   Myanmar denies committing genocide, saying it was waging a legitimate campaign against insurgents who attacked police posts.

India, currently in the Security Council as a non-permanent member for a two-year term, has been at the forefront of the years-long efforts to reform the Council. India has been saying that it rightly deserves a place as a permanent member of the 15-member Council which in its current form does not represent the geo-political realities of the 21st century. ""This is a question that has been once again asked many many times and I can understand why it has been asked so many times because the Security Council reform is an issue that has been on the agenda or the plate of the General Assembly for far too long,"" Mr Shahid said in his first press conference on Friday while responding to a question on the long-delayed UN Security Council reform process.

The G4 nations of India, Brazil, Germany and Japan have reaffirmed that it is ""indispensable"" to reform the Security Council through an expansion in permanent and non-permanent seats to enable the UN organ to better deal with the ""ever-complex and evolving challenges"" to the maintenance of international peace and security. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Foreign Minister of Brazil Carlos Alberto Franco França, Federal Foreign Minister of Germany Heiko Maas and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan Motegi Toshimitsu had met during the 76th session of the UN General Assembly. They underlined the urgency of reforming the Security Council in order to make it more legitimate, effective and representative by reflecting the reality of the contemporary world including developing countries and major contributors, the G4 Ministerial Joint Press Statement had said. ""The G4 Ministers reaffirmed that it is indispensable to reform the Security Council through an expansion of both categories, permanent and non-permanent seats, to enable the Security Council to better deal with the ever-complex and evolving challenges to the maintenance of international peace and security, and thereby to carry out its duties more effectively,"" the statement had said adding that G4 Ministers reiterated their support for each other's candidatures as aspiring new permanent members in a reformed Security Council. The G4 Ministers had expressed their strong determination to work towards launching text-based negotiations without further delay in the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN), on the basis of a single document, with a view to its adoption in the General Assembly. The Ministers instructed their delegations to the United Nations to support the efforts of the President of the 76th General Assembly and the IGN chairs, and to identify ways to develop a single consolidated text as a basis for a draft resolution.   As the General Assembly in June decided to roll over the IGN work to the 76th UNGA session, India had asserted that the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) on the long-pending Security Council reforms can no longer be used as a smokescreen.

Thailand's tourism industry has been on its knees, with the coronavirus pandemic and related restrictions slashing visitor numbers from 40 million in 2019 to a mere trickle over the last two years. Pre-virus, the sector made up a fifth of Thailand's national income, and the travel curbs have fed into the country's worst economic performance in more than two decades. The kingdom launched a ""sandbox"" scheme in July, which allowed fully vaccinated travellers from countries considered low-to-medium risk to roam free on the popular beach island for a fortnight, and then afterwards travel to the mainland without quarantine. Last week, authorities cut the required stay to a week, in line with national changes to quarantine rules. The Tourism Authority of Thailand announced late Friday that the scheme had been broadened from the around 80 countries already eligible. ""This means Thailand is now welcoming travellers from any country in the world to the sandbox programme,"" it said in a statement. Foreign Ministry spokesman Tanee Sangrat said unvaccinated children would be able to travel with their vaccinated parents. The sandbox programme has already lured more than 38,000 visitors to the white sands of Phuket, and generated $66.67 million. But tourism operators are lukewarm on the revival of the island's economy, where 90 percent of hotels have been shuttered. They have been pleading for the government to simplify entry requirements to increase visitor numbers. The changes will allow previously excluded Indonesians and Malaysians to travel to Phuket. Before the pandemic, Malaysia was Thailand's second biggest source of tourists, with more than four million travellers visiting in 2019. Thai authorities hope to reopen five other destinations, including capital Bangkok, using the sandbox model from the start of November, followed by 20 more locations in December once vaccination rates increase. However, travel advice from other countries discouraging would-be tourists could hamper Thailand's plans to reboot the industry. Britain and the US have issued travel warnings as the country grapples with a deadly third wave of the virus and low vaccination rates.   Daily new case numbers are hovering at around 11,000, following a peak of 23,000 in August -- but testing levels have also declined.

""The overwhelming... sentiment of the Filipinos is that I am not qualified and it would be a violation of the constitution to circumvent the law, the spirit of the constitution"" to run for the vice presidency, Duterte said. ""Today I announce my retirement from politics."" Duterte, who polls show remains almost as popular as when he was swept to victory in 2016 on a promise to rid the country of drugs, is constitutionally barred from seeking a second term. The authoritarian firebrand declared in August he would contest the vice presidency in the next election -- a move critics said was a smokescreen and motivated by fear that could face criminal charges after leaving office. Duterte made the surprise announcement at the venue where he was expected to register his candidacy. He did not specify when he would leave politics. The tough-talking leader has not yet announced his preferred successor, but many expect it will be his daughter, Sara, who has been the front runner in recent polls. She would likely protect Duterte from criminal charges in the Philippines, and International Criminal Court prosecutors probing his deadly drug war, which rights groups estimate has killed tens of thousands of people.   But the mayor of the southern city of Davao -- a position held by her father before he became president -- has said she would not run if Duterte sought the vice presidency.

Speaking after interacting with gram panchayats and pani samitis / village water and sanitation committees (VWSC) on the Jal Jeevan Mission, PM Modi said the mission is not just about bringing water to people but it is also a decentralisation movement that is village and women-driven. ""From the time of Independence till 2019, only three crore households in our country had access to tap water. Since the launch of the Jal Jeevan Mission in 2019, five crore households were provided with water connections,"" he said. ""Today, water is reaching every household in about 1.25 lakh villages in about 80 districts of the country. That is, today's India has done more work in just two years than what was done in the last seven decades,"" he said. In aspirational districts, piped water connections have risen from 31 lakh to over 1.16 crore, the Prime Minister said. PM Modi said it has to be ensured that the situation of bringing water to any part of the country through tankers or trains never arises. In an apparent dig at previous Congress dispensations, he said for a long time those who were responsible for policy-making lived in abundance of water. ""They had water at their homes and in their swimming pools,"" PM Modi said. ""They had not seen poverty and it was just an attraction for them. It was just a means for them to show off knowledge. They should have strived for an ideal village but they kept liking the shortcomings in the villages,"" he said. The Prime Minister also launched the Jal Jeevan Mission app for improving awareness among stakeholders and for greater transparency and accountability of schemes under the mission. He also launched the Rashtriya Jal Jeevan Kosh, where any individual, institution, corporate or philanthropist, be it in India or abroad, can contribute to help provide tap water connection in every rural household, school, anganwadi centre, ashramshala and other public institutions. 'Pani samitis' play a key role in planning, implementation, management, operation and maintenance of village water supply systems, thereby providing clean tap water to every household on a regular and long-term basis. Out of over six lakh villages, pani samitis / VWSCs have been constituted in around 3.5 lakh villages. More than 7.1 lakh women have been trained to test the quality of water by using field test kits. On August 15, 2019, PM Modi announced the Jal Jeevan Mission to provide clean tap water to every household. To realise the Prime Minister's vision of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas', and following the 'bottom up' approach, the Jal Jeevan Mission is implemented in partnership with states with a budget of R 3.60 lakh crore, according to the PM's Office.   Further, ₹ 1.42 lakh crore has been allocated to panchayati raj institutions as a tied grant under 15th Finance Commission for water and sanitation in villages for the period 2021-22 to 2025-26, the statement said.

On the question of negative press about his decisions, the Prime Minister said he attaches ""big importance"" to criticism. ""Imagine if our country had not come up with a vaccine. What would be the situation? We know that a large population of the world doesn't have access to Covid vaccines. Today, our success in vaccination is thanks to India being atmanirbhar,"" PM Modi said in an interview to Open magazine. Sixty-nine per cent of the country's adult population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and 25 per cent has taken both doses, the government said earlier this week. It aims to inoculate all eligible population by December-end. PM Modi said most people only level allegations as they lack the time to study the issue, while criticism is rooted in research. ""I, with an honest mind, respect critics a lot. But, unfortunately, the number of critics is very low. Mostly, people only level allegations, the people who play games about perception are more in number. And the reason for this is that , for criticism, one has to do a lot of hard work, research and, in today's fast-paced world, may be people don't have time. So sometimes, I miss critics,"" he added. ""We need to look at the entire logistics, planning and progress to understand the success of the vaccine drive. It is a huge effort with so many people mobilised across the country. I hope the media will take time out to highlight the efforts of our people in making the world's largest vaccination drive a stunning success,"" the PM told the magazine. The Prime Minister spotlighted how at a science conference a few years ago he suggested it was time to move away from ""Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan"" and work on the mantra of ""Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, Jai Anusandhan (research)"". He said his government gives top priority to research. ""We started planning for the vaccination drive right in May 2020 when no vaccine was even close to approval anywhere in the world. We had decided as early as then that we did not want this vaccination drive to run in the old way where it could take decades to vaccinate people. We wanted this to run in a fast, efficient, discretion-free and timebound manner,"" said the Prime Minister. Two vaccines for coronavirus: Covishield, which has been developed by British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is manufactured in India by Pune-based Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin, developed by homegrown Bharat Biotech, received emergency approval from the country's drug regulator at the start of this year. Elaborating his point, the Prime Minister said the poor today does not have to wait or pay a bribe to avail services he deserves. A poor migrant, said PM Modi, can take his second dose of vaccine in the city he works in, even if he took the first dose in his village. Technology ensures he gets the right vaccine at the right time and seamlessly, the Prime Minister said. ""When we compare India's situation in the world, we have done better than many developed countries. However, we have in our midst vested interests whose only aim is to tarnish India's name. COVID-19 was a global scourge with all countries equally affected. In this scenario, India has done better that its peers and many developed countries, notwithstanding such negative campaigns,"" he said. Reeling off numbers and his government's focus on healthcare, the Prime Minister said from six All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in 2014, the nation is now building 22 such institutes; from 380 medical colleges in 2014, there are now around 560 such colleges. The government is also working on launching a massive scheme to boost health infrastructure that will address a lot of legacy issues, said the Prime Minister. ""We are actively focusing on preventive healthcare. From improved sanitation to water supply, from yoga to Ayurveda, from strengthening diagnostic centres in remote areas, we are doing it all,"" he stressed. PM Modi credited the country for its ability to unite, come together and deliver in this hour of grave crisis. ""From being a net importer of PPE kits, we have now become one of the biggest manufacturers across the globe. Similarly, we not only managed to exponentially increase the number of ventilators but also did so largely through domestic manufacturing. India achieved this despite limited global knowledge about the virus, the economic impact of lockdown and existing state capacity constraints. Is there any better evidence of our ability to bring transformative change?"" asked PM Modi.   On the criticism against the banging of thalis and lighting diyas, the Prime Minister said there was a need to boost the morale of healthcare and frontline workers. He said the event turned into a big mass movement. "

Visuals from the area show the farmers standing on top of a pile of yellow police barricades and shouting angrily, while a handful of security forces in riot gear look on. The farmers were briefly doused with water cannons by police - with whom anti-farm law protesters have clashed several times this week alone - and who have been deployed in large numbers, with tear gas vehicles, at the spot. Visuals of water cannons being used show a powerful jet of water fired at protestors, some of whom try to get up on their vehicles to escape. Farmers are also protesting in grain markets in parts of the state, and outside the residences of MLAs from the ruling BJP-Jannayak Janata Party alliance in several districts. Yesterday farmer leader Rakesh Tikait warned of protests, including at the headquarters of the district collectorate in Punjab, to press the centre to start paddy procurement on time. This was after the centre postponed buying kharif, or monsoon, paddy from Punjab and Haryana till October 11. It said crop maturity had been delayed due to recent rains. Also yesterday, farmers and police in the state clashed yet again as protesters marched against an event attended by Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala in Jhajjar. Water cannons were fired to stop them, but dramatic visuals showed scores of men and women fighting back as they braved the streams of water and pushed through barricades. Mr Chautala was shown black flags when he reached the protest venue. That was the second consecutive day Haryana witnessed farmer-police clashes. On Thursday chaos broke out in Karnal during an event organised by the ruling BJP. Massive protests had erupted in Karnal last month too after police lathi charged farmers trying to block a BJP leader from reaching a party event. Ten people were injured in the clash. There was also a shocking video that showed IAS officer Ayush Sinha asking policemen to ""crack farmers heads""; the Chief Minister later appeared to defend Mr Sinha (whom farmers have said must be punished), saying that he had been required to take strict action. He has since been sent on leave.

The TTP, commonly known as Pakistani Taliban, is a banned terrorist organisation based along the Afghan-Pakistan border. There were reports that the Afghan Taliban had set free some dreaded TTP terrorists, including Maulvi Faqir Mohammad, after taking over Afghanistan in August. In an interview to Turkish government-owned TRT World news channel, Imran Khan said there are different terror groups which form the TTP and some of them want to talk to the Pakistan government for peace, Pakistan's Dawn News reported on Friday. ""So, we are in talks with them. It's a reconciliation process,"" the Imran Khan said. When asked if the government was asking the terrorists to lay down arms, Imran Khan said, ""Yes, we forgive them and they become normal citizens."" To a question on why the TTP was conducting attacks on Pakistan's security forces when they were in talks with the government, he said it was just a ""spate of attacks"". ""We might not reach some sort of conclusion or settlement in the end but we are talking,"" Imran Khan added. Responding to another query on whether the Afghan Taliban were acting as mediators between the TTP and Pakistan, the Imran Khan said: ""Since the talks were taking place in Afghanistan, so in that sense, yes."" The Taliban swept across Afghanistan in August, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities in the backdrop of withdrawal of the US forces that began on May 1. On August 15, the capital city of Kabul fell to the terrorists. The Taliban claimed victory over opposition forces in the last holdout province of Panjshir on September 6, completing their takeover of Afghanistan three weeks after capturing Kabul.   The Taliban have put in place a hardline interim 33-member so-called ""Cabinet"" that has no women and includes several UN-designated terrorists. The Taliban last ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. Earlier in September, Pak President Arif Alvi had suggested that the Pakistani government could consider giving an amnesty to those terrorists of the TTP who had not remained involved in ""criminal activities"" and who laid down their weapons and agreed to adhere to the Pakistani Constitution.

The Covishield vaccine, which has been developed by British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, is manufactured in India by Pune-based Serum Institute of India. ""On vaccines, that's a very technical question you have asked me. I got Covishield from India, I've got the two doses. I don't know how many countries would say that Covishield is acceptable or not, but a large portion of the countries have got Covishield,"" Mr Shahid said at his first press conference here on Friday. He was responding to a question on whether any COVID vaccine should be recognised and considered or the ones that have been validated by the World Health Organisation or any other group. ""And I've survived. But let someone else, a medical person make that call, not me,"" he added with a laugh. India has exported over 66 million vaccine doses to nearly 100 countries through grants, commercial shipments and the COVAX facility. The Maldives, home country of Mr Shahid, was among the first nations to receive the India-made vaccines in January when 100,000 doses of Covishield were dispatched to Male. In all, the Maldives has received a total of 3.12 lakh doses of Made-in-India Covid vaccines through grants, commercial shipments and the COVAX facility. The UK had initially refused to recognise Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. However, following India's strong criticism of the decision, the UK on September 22 amended its new guidelines and included the vaccine. However, the move did not provide any relief from quarantine rules for Indian travellers vaccinated with two doses of Covishield. Later, British officials said the UK has issues with India's vaccine certification process and not with the Covishield vaccine. Under the new British rules that are coming into effect from Monday, fully vaccinated Indians will have to undergo 10-day quarantine as the UK has issues with India's Covid-19 vaccine certification. India has decided to impose reciprocal curbs against all British nationals arriving in the country, official sources in New Delhi said on Friday, as the contentious issue relating to the UK not recognising Indian vaccine certificates could not be resolved despite holding a series of technical-level talks. Abdulla Shahid, who plans to convene a high-level meeting of the General Assembly in January to take stock of the global vaccination effort and equity, said the messages that he had received so far on vaccines in listening to world leaders at the General Debate, ""has been most positive from the United States, from China, from India, from many, many corners of the world, from the vaccine producers themselves"".   ""And I intend to utilise the convening power of the President of the General Assembly to bring all of them together in January, and my desire is to make sure that we all come out of the January meeting with a much more optimistic timeline where hereby we will be able to vaccinate the entire world by end of 2022,"" he said.

""The visit will contribute towards the long-standing multi-faceted relations and enhance bilateral partnership between the two countries,"" the ministry said in a press release. Mr Shringla will also visit the central district of Kandy, eastern port district of Trincomalee and the northern city of Jaffna. This is his first Lanka visit after assuming the position of foreign secretary in January last year. The visit of Harsh Vardhan Shringla will provide an opportunity to review bilateral ties, progress of ongoing bilateral projects and ongoing cooperation to tackle Covid related disruptions, the Indian High Commission in Colombo said on Friday. His visit came days after Ahmedabad-headquartered Indian multinational conglomerate Adani Group entered into an agreement with Lanka government owned Port Authority to develop the Colombo Port's West International Container Terminal. The USD 700 million Build-Operate-Transfer deal is the largest foreign investment ever in the port sector of the island nation, the Lankan government has said. Announcing Mr Shringla's visit, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday said Sri Lanka occupies a central place in India's 'Neighbourhood First' policy and Shringla's visit signifies the importance both the countries attach to strengthening their close and cordial relations in all spheres of mutual interest. His visit is taking place at a time when Lanka is reeling under economic hardships and he is likely to assess whether India could extend any assistance to the island nation to tide over the situation. It is learnt that matters relating to the building of the western container terminal at the Colombo port are also likely to figure during the Foreign Secretary's visit to the neighbouring country. In his talks in Colombo, Mr Sringla is also expected to reiterate India's views on the long-pending Tamil issue.   India has been consistently calling upon Sri Lanka to fulfil its commitments to protect the interests of the Tamil community and preserve the island nation's character as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society.

The Rajasthan Compulsory Registrations of Marriage Amendment Bill 2021 makes it mandatory to register all marriages even if a girl is under 18 and a boy is under 21 by the guardians.  The law has sparked a furore in the state with the opposition raising tough questions for the Ashok Gehlot government, saying that the government is ""giving a back-door entry to child marriage"". The petition in the high court has been filed by NGO Saarthi Trust's activist Kriti Bhati who has been working against child marriages. In the plea, the NGO from Jodhpur has challenged the constitutional validity of such a bill. Their contention is that if child marriages are registered then raising objections against them legally will become more difficult later. When those forced into a child marriage challenge it in future, the law will require them to present a registration certificate which they may or may not have access to, the petition says.  Since the bill has been passed in the Rajasthan Assembly, the High court has the primary jurisdiction of hearing the petition.

On the question of negative press about his decisions, the Prime Minister said he attaches ""big importance"" to criticism. ""Imagine if our country had not come up with a vaccine. What would be the situation? We know that a large population of the world doesn't have access to Covid vaccines. Today, our success in vaccination is thanks to India being atmanirbhar,"" PM Modi said in an interview to Open magazine. Sixty-nine per cent of the country's adult population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and 25 per cent has taken both doses, the government said earlier this week. It aims to inoculate all eligible population by December-end. PM Modi said most people only level allegations as they lack the time to study the issue, while criticism is rooted in research. ""I, with an honest mind, respect critics a lot. But, unfortunately, the number of critics is very low. Mostly, people only level allegations, the people who play games about perception are more in number. And the reason for this is that , for criticism, one has to do a lot of hard work, research and, in today's fast-paced world, may be people don't have time. So sometimes, I miss critics,"" he added. ""We need to look at the entire logistics, planning and progress to understand the success of the vaccine drive. It is a huge effort with so many people mobilised across the country. I hope the media will take time out to highlight the efforts of our people in making the world's largest vaccination drive a stunning success,"" the PM told the magazine. The Prime Minister spotlighted how at a science conference a few years ago he suggested it was time to move away from ""Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan"" and work on the mantra of ""Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, Jai Anusandhan (research)"". He said his government gives top priority to research. ""We started planning for the vaccination drive right in May 2020 when no vaccine was even close to approval anywhere in the world. We had decided as early as then that we did not want this vaccination drive to run in the old way where it could take decades to vaccinate people. We wanted this to run in a fast, efficient, discretion-free and timebound manner,"" said the Prime Minister. Two vaccines for coronavirus: Covishield, which has been developed by British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is manufactured in India by Pune-based Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin, developed by homegrown Bharat Biotech, received emergency approval from the country's drug regulator at the start of this year. Elaborating his point, the Prime Minister said the poor today does not have to wait or pay a bribe to avail services he deserves. A poor migrant, said PM Modi, can take his second dose of vaccine in the city he works in, even if he took the first dose in his village. Technology ensures he gets the right vaccine at the right time and seamlessly, the Prime Minister said. ""When we compare India's situation in the world, we have done better than many developed countries. However, we have in our midst vested interests whose only aim is to tarnish India's name. COVID-19 was a global scourge with all countries equally affected. In this scenario, India has done better that its peers and many developed countries, notwithstanding such negative campaigns,"" he said. Reeling off numbers and his government's focus on healthcare, the Prime Minister said from six All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in 2014, the nation is now building 22 such institutes; from 380 medical colleges in 2014, there are now around 560 such colleges. The government is also working on launching a massive scheme to boost health infrastructure that will address a lot of legacy issues, said the Prime Minister. ""We are actively focusing on preventive healthcare. From improved sanitation to water supply, from yoga to Ayurveda, from strengthening diagnostic centres in remote areas, we are doing it all,"" he stressed. PM Modi credited the country for its ability to unite, come together and deliver in this hour of grave crisis. ""From being a net importer of PPE kits, we have now become one of the biggest manufacturers across the globe. Similarly, we not only managed to exponentially increase the number of ventilators but also did so largely through domestic manufacturing. India achieved this despite limited global knowledge about the virus, the economic impact of lockdown and existing state capacity constraints. Is there any better evidence of our ability to bring transformative change?"" asked PM Modi.   On the criticism against the banging of thalis and lighting diyas, the Prime Minister said there was a need to boost the morale of healthcare and frontline workers. He said the event turned into a big mass movement. "

The visit comes amid speculation that Mr Sangma is upset with the party after Vicent H Pala was made the state Congress chief and he is on his way out along with a dozen MLAs to join the Trinamool Congress. While Dr Sangma has not denied the speculation, he has claimed it's ""too pre-mature"" to second-guess. Wait to hear from the ""horse's mouth"", he said. A close aide of Dr Sangma told NDTV that the Congress right now has 17 MLAs in Meghalaya. With elections due in 2023, the MLAs would like to retain their seats, so Dr Sangma will need at least 12 MLAs with him to not attract the anti-defection law. The state assembly has 60 seats. ""I will be travelling to Delhi on Sunday...there is a mechanism. We will try to resolve all issues,"" Dr Sangma told reporters on Friday. ""That particular presumption and assumption is too premature (about him along with other colleagues leaving the Congress). I have always maintained that I should not be a victim of pessimism,"" he said. On the speculation of joining All India Trinamool Congress (TMC), Dr Sangma however said, ""...you know you have to wait for the time, if it is coming from the horse's mouth then you give credibility, it's a question of giving weightage to news when it comes from the right source."" Stating that there are grievances among the party members, the former Chief Minister said some of them are already ""victims of those grievances"" while referring to one of the senior members leaving the Congress to join the NPP ahead of the bye-elections to three assembly seats. The much-awaited by polls for the Mawryngkneng, Rajabala and Mawphlang is scheduled for October 30. Votes will be counted on November 2.   The Congress is likely to announce names of the candidates contesting the by polls on Saturday. Meanwhile, sources in the Trinamool Congress have indicated to NDTV that top party leader and strategist Prasant Kishor's team is in touch with several Congress leaders from Meghalaya."

The chargesheet - filed in April by the UP Police's Special Task Force and presented before a Mathura court - has still not been made available to Mr Kappan or his legal representatives, his lawyers have claimed. They have petitioned the trial court, seeking ""true copies of the document to the accused"". Thirty-six articles written by Mr Kappan - accused of having links to the Popular Front of India or PFI, an outfit the Yogi Adityanath government wants banned - have been cited in the chargesheet. One of the articles is on the protests against the controversial citizenship law that started in December 2019 across the country and continued till the pandemic began. ""The article talks about the firing by a Hindu man Kapil Gurjar during the Shaheen Bagh Protests and compares this incident to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The article also criticizes that way the Delhi Police handled the protests,"" the chargesheet reads. Another article cited is on Sharjeel Imam, an activist facing a terror case over his alleged role in the northeast Delhi riots last year, saying it promotes feelings of communalism. ""During a riot, when you take the name of only a particular community and publish incidents related to that community, members of that community get enraged. Responsible reporters do not indulge in such communal reporting, but Siddiqui Kappan's journalism was only meant to incite Muslims and to further the agenda of the PFI that wants to provoke riots and communal feelings,"" it reads. The chargesheet also cites another article on the controversy over the alleged role of the Nizamuddin Markaz in spreading the pandemic, saying ""it has been presented as a ploy by the central government to defame the Muslim community."" The chargesheet calls the articles ""a collaboration with members of SIMI and an attempt to legitimize the banned outfit's agenda"". However, Wills Mathews , Mr Kappan's lawyer, called it one-sided and highlighted how Mr Kappan, the other accused and their legal counsels have not been provided with authorised copies of this chargesheet even a year after the journalist's arrest. ""Mr Kappan has nothing to hide. He even volunteered to undergo Narco analysis or brain mapping tests to prove his innocence. Even after a full year of Kappan's arrest and six months after the chargesheet was filed in court, we have still not received it,"" Mr Mathews said in a statement. Mr Kappan and three others have been in jail after their arrest in October last year, when they were headed from Delhi to western Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, where a young Dalit woman was gang-raped in September by four men from a so-called upper caste community , eventually leading to her death. Mr Kappan and the others have been charged under the stringent anti-terror law and other sections of the Indian Penal Code. All of them say they have been framed by the police.   In August, a Mathura court dismissed the UP Police's plea to interrogate Kappan again about some incriminating document found at his Delhi residence. Additional District and Sessions Judge Anil Kumar Pandey rejected the Special Task Force plea, saying that the accused cannot be allowed to be interrogated again after the chargesheet in the case has already been filed, news agency PTI reported."

""When the [Sachin] Waze episode happened, I had said that if I was in the government, I would have arrested Param Bir Singh first. This means the centre used this IPS officer to defame the state government and so that is why they have aided Param Bir Singh in escaping abroad,"" Maharashtra Congress Chief Nana Patole said. BJP spokesperson Ram Kadam countered him, saying, ""When Param Bir Singh wrote a letter and brought the ₹ 100-crore extortion allegation to the forefront the fight started then. So that Param Bir Singh does not name his political bosses, has he been sent abroad by his political bosses?"" The charges came a day after Maharashtra Home Minister Dilip Walse Patil said that Mr Singh, whose handling of the bomb scare near the home of India's richest man Mukesh Ambani earlier this year has raised questions and is facing a series of extortion cases, was missing. ""Along with the Union Home Ministry, we're also searching for his whereabouts. I've heard something like that but as a government officer, he can't go abroad without government clearance. We've issued a Lookout Circular and if he went away, then it is not good,"" Mr Patil said, on reports of Mr Singh fleeing to Russia. ""Whether it is a minister, officer, or Chief Minister, there are limitations and without the permission of the government of India one cannot go outside the country. No one can cross these limitations. What action can be taken will have to be discussed with the centre. Maharashtra government is looking for him and once he is found we will decide,"" the Home Minister added. On February 25 this year, an SUV with gelatin sticks was found at Carmichael Road, near the residence of Mukesh Ambani. The car belonged to Mansukh Hiren whose body was later found in the Kalwa creek in Thane. A police officer, Sachin Waze, was named as the prime conspirator in the case of planting the explosives and the subsequent murder of Mansukh Hiren. Mr Waze was known to be close to Param Bir Singh and had direct access to him despite being just an Assistant Police Inspector. Mr Singh was transferred from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March after Mr Waze's arrest by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The NIA chargesheet in the case has not named Param Bir Singh as an accused but several revelations in the chargesheet could make things difficult for Param Bir Singh. After his transfer to the Home Guard department, the IPS officer made sensational accusations against then state home minister Anil Deshmukh of asking police officers to collect bribes from hotel and bar owners, an allegation the latter denied.   But Mr Deshmukh stepped down from his post subsequently as the CBI registered a case against him. Mr Deshmukh has also not responded to summons by the Enforcement Directorate which is probing money-laundering allegations against him. The ED has asked for help from the CBI to trace Mr Deshmukh. Mr Singh has also been named in at least four extortion complaints and Maharashtra Police Chief Sanjay Pandey recently sent a proposal to suspend Mr Singh and other police officials named in the extortion cases, but the state Home Department has sought more details, news agency PTI reported."

It was North Korea's second known weapons test this week after the launch of a previously unseen hypersonic missile on Tuesday. It has also fired ballistic missiles and a cruise missile with potential nuclear capabilities in recent weeks. The UN Security Council met behind closed doors on Friday to discuss the latest tests and Washington said it was assessing the missile launches. The tests highlighted how North Korea has been steadily developing increasingly sophisticated weapons, raising the stakes for efforts to press it to give up its nuclear and missile programmes in return for US sanctions relief. The Academy of Defence Science, a military weapons developer, said the test was aimed at confirming the practical functionality of the missile's launcher, radar, comprehensive battle command vehicle and combat performance, the official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. The missile has new key technologies such as twin rudder control and double impulse flight engine, it said. South Korea's military said detailed analysis was needed to verify the KCNA report. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did not appear to have attended the test, which was instead overseen by Pak Jong Chon, a member of the ruling Workers' Party's powerful politburo and Central Committee. ""The remarkable combat performance of the new-type anti-aircraft missile with features of rapid responsiveness and guidance accuracy of missile control system as well as the substantial increase in the distance of downing air targets has been verified,"" KCNA said, citing the academy. North Korea has said in recent weeks that its weapons tests are aimed at boosting its defence capabilities just as other countries do, accusing the United States and South Korea of ""double standards"" and ""hostile policy"" toward it. On Wednesday, Kim said he has no reasons to attack South Korea and was willing to reopen severed inter-Korean hotlines. But it criticised U.S. President Joe Biden's administration for using ""more cunning ways and methods"" in pursuing hostile policy while proposing dialogue. South Korea's Unification Ministry, which is in charge of North Korean affairs, said the North did not answer the lines on Friday but it vowed to continue efforts to restore the channels and resume talks. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in a speech celebrating the 73rd Armed Forces Day on Friday, did not refer to North Korea but said he was committed to fostering lasting peace while sternly responding to any life-threatening action. Analysts say the North's carrot-and-stick approach is aimed at securing international recognition as a nuclear weapons state and driving a wedge between the United States and South Korea, with an eye on Moon's desire for a diplomatic legacy before his term ends in May. The Biden administration has said it has no hostile intent toward North Korea and has called on it to accept its offers of talks to break the impasse over denuclearisation negotiations.   ""We've made specific proposals for discussions with the North Koreans, but have not received a response to date and we remain prepared to discuss the full range of issues,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters. ""We're assessing the specific nature of these launch events."" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

Chinese-claimed Taiwan has complained for a year or more of repeated missions by China's air force near the democratically governed island, often in the southwestern part of its air defence zone close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands. The Taiwan Defence Ministry first reported Taiwanese fighters had scrambled against 18 J-16 and four Su-30 fighter jets plus two nuclear-capable H-6 bombers and an anti-submarine aircraft. Then in the early hours of Saturday, the ministry said a further 13 Chinese aircraft were involved in a mission on Friday night - 10 J-16s, 2 H-6s and an early warning aircraft. It said Taiwan sent combat aircraft to warn away the Chinese aircraft, while missile systems were deployed to monitor them. The first batch of Chinese aircraft all flew in an area close to the Pratas Islands, with the two bombers flying closest to the atoll, according to a map issued by the ministry. The second group flew down into the Bashi Channel that separates Taiwan from the Philippines, a key waterway that links the Pacific with the disputed South China Sea. China has yet to comment on its activities. It has previously said such flights were to protect the country's sovereignty and aimed at ""collusion"" between Taiwan and the United States, the island's most important international backer. The previous largest incursion happened in June, involving 28 Chinese air force aircraft. China's latest mission came less than a day after its government launched a attack on Taiwan's foreign minister, evoking the words of revolutionary leader Mao Zedong to denounce him as a ""shrilling"" fly for his efforts to promote Taiwan internationally. China has stepped up military and political pressure to try and force Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty.   Taiwan says it is an independent country and will defend its freedom and democracy.

The grim threshold comes with an average of well over 1,000 dying each day, in a country where 55.7 percent of the population is now fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After a heavily criticized early response to the pandemic, the United States has since organized among the world's most effective vaccine roll-outs. But it nonetheless finds itself having notched the most fatalities in the world, far exceeding other frontrunners such as Brazil and India, and facing a resurgence in cases due to the prominence of the highly contagious Delta variant. While the latest global coronavirus wave peaked in late August, the virus continues to spread rapidly, particularly in the United States. The vaccination campaign launched by US authorities in December -- which had reached a peak in April, with sometimes more than four million injections per day -- has meanwhile slowed considerably. Masking remains a political issue in much of the country, dividing many Americans. Some Republican governors, such as those in Texas and Florida, have sought to ban mandatory masking in their states, citing individual freedoms. The Democratic state of California on the other hand announced on Friday that Covid vaccinations will be compulsory for all students. In Washington, hundreds of thousands of white flags fluttered on the grass on the National Mall, not far from the White House, as somber reminders of those who have died of Covid in the United States.

Bolivar Garzon, the director of the South American country's SNAI prison authority, said the government aimed to prioritize the elderly, women, and prisoners with disabilities and terminal illnesses in the wake of the clashes on Tuesday at the Penitenciaria del Litoral in the southern city of Guayaquil. The country's prisons are currently home to some 39,000 inmates, Garzon added. Garzon said the riot, the latest in a wave of prison violence in the Andean country, was sparked by ""a battle for control by organized crime groups."" Riots left 79 dead in February and 22 in July of this year. Officials say gangs have alliances with transnational criminal groups and are battling over drug trafficking routes. Ecuador has sent 3,600 police and military reinforcements to prisons across the country to maintain order, Interior Minister Alexandra Vela told reporters on Friday. She added that forensic units had identified 41 of the victims, and had delivered the bodies of 21 of the victims to their families. Dozens of inmates' relatives have gathered outside a Guayaquil morgue seeking information about their loved ones. Authorities said at least six victims were decapitated. Eduardo Montes, 60, was awaiting news of his 25-year-old brother Vicente Montes, who is due to be released in one month.

Held in prison since his arrest in Winnipeg, Manitoba last December, the 80-year-old Finnish-Canadian millionaire made a brief court appearance via video link. Scott Farlinger, a lawyer representing the Canadian government in the case, explained that Nygard, who'd been denied bail on the grounds he might tamper with witnesses or his accusers, had opted not to fight the extradition. ""This process can now move forward in order for him to face trial in the United States,"" defense lawyer Brian Greenspan confirmed. That, he said will provide Nygard ""the opportunity to raise his defense and to challenge the truthfulness of the evidence which has been brought against him."" Canada's attorney general must still approve the extradition. Nygard faces nine charges in the United States involving dozens of victims. His alleged crimes, according to the US indictment, took place between 1990 and 2020. Nygard and his alleged accomplices, including employees of his group, ""used force, fraud, and coercion to cause women and minors to have sex"" with them, it said. The perma-tanned Nygard, known for his long, flowing gray hair and flamboyant dress sense, has denied the allegations.   Also Friday, Toronto police announced that an arrest warrant had been issued for Nygard for six alleged sexual assaults, some involving forcible confinement, between 1987 and 2006.

The Northern Ireland protocol was part of the Brexit divorce settlement Johnson negotiated with the European Union. But London has said it must be rewritten less than a year after it came into operation due to the barriers businesses are facing importing goods from Britain. ""We hope that we can fix this thing. This is not a problem that we wanted, I have got to stress that. I can't emphasize that more,"" Johnson told BBC Northern Ireland. ""The protocol could in principle work... It has got enough leeway in the language for it to be applied in a common sense way without creating too many checks down the Irish Sea."" But he warned it will come down to ""fixing it or ditching it"". ""What I am saying to you is I want to see a real negotiation. I want to see the EU come to the table with some serious proposals to fix it."" Brussels are due to respond in full shortly to a ""command paper"" put forward by London in July calling for fundamental changes to the protocol. The European Commission has rejected a total renegotiation. The July proposals also once again raised the prospect of triggering ""Article 16"" of the agreement, which allows either side to unilaterally seek to dispense with some of the terms if they are proving unexpectedly harmful. Neither side can scrap the protocol via these safeguard measures.   Asked if he would trigger Article 16 as soon as next week, Johnson said it depended on what the EU brings forward and ""whether they are willing to negotiate seriously about removing the obstructions that we have currently got.""

The controversial statute, which went into force on September 1, represents ""an open threat to the rule of law,"" deputy assistant attorney general Brian Netter declared in court arguments in Austin. In its challenge, the US government described the ban as ""a truly extraordinary law designed to outflank the federal government and to violate the constitution,"" Netter said, adding a ""judicial intervention"" was necessary to make the law unenforceable until the case is decided. The Texas law, the most restrictive of its kind in the country, prohibits abortions as soon as an embryo's heartbeat is detectable, usually at around six weeks of pregnancy, and does not allow exceptions in cases of incest or rape. In recent years similar laws have been passed in other states but were struck down because they violated US Supreme Court precedent from Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling which guaranteed a woman's right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, at around 22 weeks of pregnancy. The Texas law is unique in that it empowers anyone to file lawsuits against a person who has assisted in an abortion, which prompted Netter to accuse state authorities of enabling a regime of ""vigilante justice."" The nine-justice Supreme Court, with its clear conservative majority, cited such ""novel"" procedural issues when it decided last month against intervening to block the law, Texas Senate Bill 8, as pro-choice advocates had requested. The federal government has entered the fray, citing its interest in upholding Americans' constitutional rights. Netter argued that while the United States rarely files suit to challenge state laws, ""this suit is necessary because SB-8 represents a thus far unprecedented attack on the supremacy of the federal government, of the federal constitution."" Attorney William Thompson of the Texas Attorney General's Office accused Netter of ""inflammatory rhetoric"" and insisted the law respects Supreme Court precedent. But Judge Robert Pitman retorted: ""If the state's so confident in the constitutionality of the limitations on a woman's access to abortion, then why did it go to such great lengths to create this very unusual private cause of action?""   Pitman could issue a ruling soon in the case. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

The interpreters are in hiding but their family members will be held responsible if they fail to show up in court ""and severely punished to teach other traitors a lesson,"" said a letter from the Taliban, which was aired by the broadcaster. NOS said the recipient, who worked for the EU's policing agency Europol in Afghanistan, was accused of taking ""dishonourable and forbidden money"" from foreigners. ""We will take revenge. If we are not able to get hold of you, we will settle scores with your near ones,"" said another letter to an interpreter whom the Taliban accused of being responsible for the deaths of some of their fighters. All indications show that the letters, which bear official seals, were despatched by the Taliban, NOS said. It said it had contacted about 10 interpreters or people who had worked for the Dutch and who all said their situation was becoming increasing difficult. The Taliban in June urged interpreters who had worked for foreign forces to repent but urged them to stay on in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of foreign forces and assured them they would not be harmed. Just after taking power, the Taliban declared a general amnesty for Afghan government and military officials.   But despite their pledges not to avenge themselves, a confidential United Nations report said the Taliban were tracking down people who worked with foreign forces.

""Almost 200 military tanker personnel, 100 of which are drivers, will be deployed from Monday to provide temporary support as part of the government's wider action to further relieve pressure on petrol stations and address the shortage of HGV drivers,"" the government said in a news release. Motorists queued at fuel pumps across Britain at the beginning of the week, draining tanks and fraying tempers. The government says a lack of tanker drivers to deliver fuel and unprecedented demand is behind the crisis. Demand for fuel has stabilised throughout the week and stations are gradually stocking up again, but some parts of the country still face severe shortages. ""Thanks to the immense efforts of industry over the past week, we are seeing continued signs that the situation at the pumps is slowly improving,"" said business minister Kwasi Kwarteng. ""It's important to stress there is no national shortage of fuel in the UK, and people should continue to buy fuel as normal. The sooner we return to our normal buying habits, the sooner we can return to normal,"" he added. The military drivers were put on standby at the beginning of the week, and have since received specialised training. The government has already made a U-turn on tighter post-Brexit immigration policy, offering short-term visa waivers to foreign truckers to help plug the shortfall. Fuel operators, including Shell, BP and Esso, said there was ""plenty of fuel at UK refineries"" and expected demand to return to normal soon. But following a week of queues, drivers in many parts of the country are still unable to get fuel, stoking concern about the effects on the wider economy. Critics blame government inaction on tackling shortages of lorry drivers after Britain's departure from the European Union in January and the pandemic, which saw many foreign truckers leave the country.   As well as fuel deliveries, the shortage has led to empty supermarket shelves and raised fears about deliveries of food and toys for Christmas.

""I'm telling you, we're going to get this done,"" he told reporters after meeting with House Democrats who are deeply divided on a spending spree that Biden says would restore America's battered middle class. ""It doesn't matter when. It doesn't matter whether it's in six minutes, six days or six weeks, we're gonna get it done."" The unusual presidential visit follows weeks of trips by party leaders in the other direction to the White House as Biden tries to get the two ambitious spending plans passed into law. One would funnel $1.2 trillion into repairing infrastructure and the other would allocate even more for education, child care, and promoting clean energy. ""These are his proposals. These are his bold ideas,"" Biden's press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. ""This is his plan that he's outlined: to not just rebuild our roads, our railways and bridges, and put millions of people back to work, but also to make child care, elder care, (pre-school programs) more cost effective, to address the climate crisis. And he wants to make the case directly to members."" Biden's political legacy is at stake and so probably are the Democrats' chances of keeping control of Congress in midterm elections next year. However, on Thursday, a game of chicken between moderate Democrats and more leftwing members over the bills ended in stalemate. Their razor-thin majority in Congress means that even a few defections could prevent votes from succeeding. Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the fractious House Democrats, pulled a vote on infrastructure Friday for the second night running as congressional leaders arbitrated disputes among the party's centrist and left groupings. - Trust issue - The impasse on the Democratic side is rooted in political differences over how much the government should spend, but also on the sheer lack of trust between competing factions. On one side, moderate senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema -- popularly dubbed the ""Manchinema"" duo -- refuse to back the proposed $3.5 trillion price tag for the social spending package. They do, however, support something more modest, with Manchin proposing $1.5 trillion. They also have already voted in favor of the separate $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. Over in the House, a younger, fiery generation of more leftwing representatives insists on keeping the $3.5 trillion number for social spending, or at least something close. And to maintain negotiating leverage, they are refusing to back the popular infrastructure bill, saying this can only come once they know they have a ""yes"" from the Democratic-controlled Senate for the social spending deal. ""If there's something else that's short of a vote, that somebody can offer me that gives me those same assurances, I want to listen to that,"" Pramila Jayapal, chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters, in a hint that the left might be willing to compromise. ""But right now I'm still saying we need a vote."" Psaki said the administration's outreach to congressional Democrats and their staff had included at least 300 phone calls or meetings since September 1. During the 2020 campaign Biden repeatedly touted his dealmaking chops -- established during his four decades as a senator -- but he has made the journey up to Capitol Hill only rarely as president. His in-person visit was a welcome development to rank-and-file Democrats who have been voicing hope he would get more deeply involved. On Friday Pelosi decided against trying again straight away for a vote on the infrastructure bill, amid assurances from the progressives that they would kill it. She now has the option of putting everything on ice to buy time for crafting an overall agreement on the two bills. There is no hard timeline for action on either bill, and Biden will not see the lack of progress as a defeat unless it starts dragging into the election year. With a threatened government shutdown averted until December, the next urgent deadline is to raise the national debt limit ahead of the default date of October 18 -- and there is still no plan on how to accomplish it. Usually this is not a complicated issue. This year, though, Republicans are refusing to join Democrats in granting authorization, while Democrats argue they should not have to bear responsibility alone.   The standoff leaves the United States close to the cliff edge of a default on its $28 trillion debt, with the lack of progress expected to soon start raising pulses in the financial markets.

Main donors the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Canada as well as the European Union made the appeal after dozens of women told investigators they were offered work in exchange for sex or were raped. ""We expect full commitment from the WHO to prevent and address such acts, including through fundamental reforms to the WHO,"" the governments said in a joint statement. The UN health agency's member governments said that ""we will ensure that the WHO leadership's commitments lead to accountability, increased capability, action, and swift change"", calling for an ""immediate, thorough and detailed assessment"" of what went wrong. The 35-page report published Tuesday by an independent investigative committee centred on accusations against local and international personnel deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo to fight an Ebola outbreak from 2018 to 2020. Calling it a ""dark day for WHO"", the UN body's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told victims he was ""sorry"" and that it was ""top priority that the perpetrators are not excused but held to account"". - Structural failures - The report cited ""individual negligence that may amount to professional misconduct"". The authors also said they found ""clear structural failures and unpreparedness to manage the risks of incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse"" in the poor central African country. Among the 83 suspects identified, 21 were employed by the WHO, though only four were working for the health agency when the report was published. Four have had their contracts terminated and are banned from future employment at the WHO, while two senior staff have been placed on administrative leave. The agency will also refer rape allegations to the Congolese authorities and those of other concerned states, Tedros said. The allegations would not have come to light were it not for a year-long probe revealed a year ago by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and The New Humanitarian documenting alleged exploitation and abuse of women by international staff during the 2018-20 Ebola crisis. The report said WHO's leadership was aware of sex abuse allegations in May 2019, a full six weeks earlier than it initially claimed. Asked whether he intends to resign, Tedros, 56, and who will seek a second term at the head of the powerful UN agency based in Geneva, admitted he had been to the country 14 times without anyone raising the matter. ""Probably I should have asked questions,"" he said.   With more than 2,200 recorded deaths, the Ebola epidemic was the worst to hit DR Congo since the disease was first identified in 1976.

Blinken will travel to Paris from Monday through Wednesday for a meeting of the OECD club of advanced market economies and also meet French officials, the State Department announced. Blinken will then fly from Paris to Mexico City for his first trip to the US neighbor as secretary of state, which was already announced by the Mexican government. France was infuriated last month when Australia canceled a multibillion-dollar deal for French submarines, saying it would pursue US nuclear versions as tensions rise with China. ""We agree that the September 15 announcement would have benefited from better and more open consultation among allies,"" said Karen Donfried, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. ""Our meetings in Paris are part of our commitment toward a process of in-depth consultations going forward. We recognize this will take time and will take hard work and it will need to be demonstrated not only in words but also in deeds,"" she told reporters. France accused the United States of betrayal and Australia of back-stabbing and withdrew ambassadors from both countries. Tensions began to ease when President Joe Biden spoke by telephone with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. French Ambassador Philippe Etienne returned Wednesday to Washington and promptly received separate meetings with Blinken and Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor. France is still livid with Australia, with a long-planned round of Australia-EU free trade talks postponed. - Bringing France into Asia strategy - Australia announced the submarine decision as it joined a new alliance with Britain and the United States, dubbed AUKUS, one of a series of initiatives by Biden as he views a rising China as the paramount concern of the United States in the 21st century. Amid accusations by Paris pundits that France was collateral damage in Biden's laser focus on China, US officials assured that Blinken would speak to France, which has Pacific territories, about the Asia strategy. ""AUKUS is not intended to replace existing arrangements or existing partnerships,"" Donfried said. ""On the contrary, we welcome the opportunity to discuss how to include the EU and other partners in our initiatives around the Indo-Pacific going forward,"" she said. Some Europeans were also concerned by Biden's decision to pull troops out of Afghanistan, allowing the Taliban to take over. Biden said America's longest war was a costly distraction from competition with China. Blinken had already been planning to visit for the 60th anniversary of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. He will co-chair an OECD ministerial that will look at promoting a green economy, a month before high-stakes UN climate talks in Glasgow. China, which has observer status at the OECD, frequently comes under fire from the US for its state-driven trading practices as well as its aggressive lending to developing nations. Blinken will speak at the OECD on ""shared values"" including transparency, said Matt Murray, a senior State Department official handling economic affairs.

The closed door meeting lasted just over an hour. It was requested by the United States -- a rare show of initiative in recent years -- France and Britain. The goal was to examine North Korea's launch early this week of what it called a hypersonic gliding vehicle. On Friday North Korean state media said the country has tested a new anti-aircraft missile. ""France wanted a public statement but Russia and China said that this was not the time, that they needed more time to analyze the situation,"" a diplomat from a country that is part of the Security Council told AFP. Diplomats from France -- which wanted the council to issue a statement -- were not immediately available for comment. In 2017 at the behest of the Trump administration, the Security Council imposed tough economic sanctions against North Korea three times after it staged a nuclear test and several involving conventional missiles. The council passed them unanimously each time. But since then the council has failed to reach a common stance on nuclear-armed North Korea. Several times China -- Pyongyang's key ally -- and Russia have requested in vain the partial lifting of sanctions against North Korea. Eight months after taking office the administration of President Joe Biden has not yet come up with a clear strategy toward North Korea. ""They tell us that are still studying this dossier,"" an ambassador from a Security Council member state said.   The diplomat complained that US lack of action is also seen on other international issues like the Middle East and the Western Sahara.

Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will meet on October 7-8 with officials in Pakistan, which has long faced US accusations of playing a double game in Afghanistan where the Taliban swept back to power in August. ""We seek a strong partnership with Pakistan on counterterrorism and we expect sustained action against all terrorist groups without distinction,"" Sherman told reporters. ""Both of our countries have suffered terribly from the scourge of terrorism and we look forward to cooperative efforts to eliminate all regional and global terrorist threats,"" she said from Switzerland, her first stop on a trip that will also take her to India and Uzbekistan. Pakistan points to its efforts against terrorists and the thousands who have died in attacks at home, but it has also faced criticism for not doing more to curb Islamist radicals that target neighbor and arch-rival India. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, a longtime critic of US military campaigns, said in an interview aired Friday that his government had opened talks with Pakistani Taliban about laying down their arms. ""Some of the Pakistani Taliban groups actually want to talk to our government for some peace, for some reconciliation,"" he told Turkey's TRT World television. He said the discussions were taking place in Afghanistan with sections of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which has waged years of deadly attacks. ""I repeat, I do not believe in military solutions,"" Khan said. Khan has encouraged the world to engage Afghanistan's Taliban and provide economic support, although he has stopped short of backing recognition -- a step opposed by the United States. Sherman praised Pakistan's calls for an inclusive government in Afghanistan. ""We look to Pakistan to play a critical role in enabling that outcome,"" she said. Pakistan, a Cold War ally of the United States, was one of only three nations to recognize the Taliban's hardline 1996-2001 regime but quickly backed the US-led war to oust them after the September 11, 2001 attacks.   US officials say segments of Pakistan's powerful intelligence service maintained backing for the Taliban, in part due to the former Western-backed Afghan government's close ties with India.

Officials have auctioned off assets valued at USD 84.8 million since 2019. The property, which was sold on e-commerce sites by the local courts, came from at least 21 people, reported Taiwan News. The sale included a variety of items including household items and others. But real estate accounted for much of the property sold. The Wall Street Journal verified the data gathered by the Uyghur Human Rights Project. The move to auction the property seemed to aim at dismantling wealth in the Uyghur community and have targeted business leaders, Taiwan News said. Abdujelil Helil, an Uyghur exporter, was among the persons whose property were auctioned. Helil has been detained on terrorism financing charges since 2017. He had to surrender US$11 million in assets to the authorities. One of his buildings was sold for US$8.3 million on Taobao, China's equivalent to Amazon, according to Taiwan News.

He added that any meeting with senior party leaders will be a part of the routine they follow when they visit the national capital. Another MLA Kismat Lal said he was going to meet his daughter who is studying in Delhi. Asked about the issue of change in the state chief minister, Mr Lal said that Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel was doing ""good work"" in the state and there should not be any change in the leadership. Earlier on Wednesday, more than a dozen Chhattisgarh Congress MLAs landed in Delhi to extend their support to Mr Baghel for the chief minister post.

Francois Verove, 59, died by suicide at his rented home in the south of France after receiving a summons for questioning, leaving a ""written statement"" and with DNA evidence then confirming his identity, the Paris prosector and sources said. The man, nicknamed ""Le Grele"" (""pockmarked""), had been wanted by police since the 1980s for the murder and rape of young girls, but was never caught. The list of crimes he allegedly committed in the 1980s and 90s includes rape of minors, murder, attempted murder, armed robbery and kidnapping of minors, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement late Thursday. ""DNA tests which were immediately ordered by the investigating magistrate established a match between the genetic profile found at several crime scenes and that of the dead man,"" she added. - Multiple killings - Verove died by suicide in a rented apartment, leaving a written confession, a source close to the case told AFP. In the most notorious case, he was suspected of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl named Cecile who was found dead in the basement of the building where she lived in the 19th arrondissement of Paris. Police believe he grabbed her as she came out of the building's lift on her way to school and dragged her into the basement. He is also thought to have strangled a couple to death in the central Marais district of the capital in 1987. Over the years, investigators came to believe that the suspect may have been part of the gendarmerie -- police-like armed forces in charge of internal security -- at the time of the crimes, and established a DNA profile of him. In recent months, an investigating magistrate had begun questioning around 750 gendarmes who had been deployed in the Paris region at the time. One of them was Verove, a 59-year-old man living in the south of France, who was sent a summons on September 24 for questioning on September 29. But he was then was reported missing by his wife on September 27 and found dead two days later in Grau-du-Roi, a seaside resort on the Mediterranean coast, the Paris prosecutor said. He was a former gendarme, who later became a police officer and then retired, she confirmed. - 'Took secrets with him' - The Midi Libre newspaper said he had been living quietly in a residential neighbourhood in Grau-du-Roi for years. According to local media, Verove mentioned ""past impulses"" in a letter he left behind, which he had since brought ""under control"", and said he had committed no crimes after 1997. The murder confession contained no specifics, they said. In 1986, police had published a police sketch based on witness statements that showed a man of around 25 years old, six feet tall with light-brown hair, and with visible traces of acne on his face. A lawyer for Cecile's family, Didier Seban, thanked police for their work but also told AFP that it was ""painful to know that the criminal took his secrets with him"". According to the Parisien newspaper, Verove is also the suspect in another murder near Paris, of 19-year-old Karine Leroy, in 1994 in the city of Meaux.

""There's nothing beautiful about it,"" grumbled Jose Carlos Bautista Martin, a pensioner of 70 who looked on agog with fellow villagers as the volcano continued to spew waves of hot lava into the air. ""All it leaves behind is black, dark lava and an intense blaze which looks as if it will go on for ever, growling as if it were the very devil himself,"" he adds of the aeroplane-like cacophany accompanying an eruption which has wrought havoc and forced thousands from their homes. Tazacorte port offers a perfect vantage point for spying the mouth of the volcano which dominates the island, a popular holiday destination, as well as the heaps of ash and lava cascading down to the sea hundreds of metres below its peak. Even by Thursday experts estimated the debris had covered an area bigger than 25 football pitches, with concerns rising over worsening air quality in nearby residential areas since the eruption began on September 19, the volvano sending tongues of molten rock flowing out of its main cone. Despite the damage to countless homes and businesses local people are coming together to show each other solidarity in a time of crisis. Down in the port, fisherman Jesus Guillermo Hernandez Rodriguez, 49, defiantly hoses away sticky blackened volcanic sand which has covered his vessel. ""It is a daily job, maintaining the boats,"" sighs Rodriguez, rubbing his white beard in frustration with weatherbeaten hands. Even if he still tries to manage a minimum catch, most of what he does pick up ""is not edible because of the sand,"" the dark gunk sticking to what he does land. - What future? - Hernandez normally lands a catch worth around 3,000 euros a month which he shares with a colleague but this past fortnight is a virtual write-off and he expects more of the same for now as he worries about the cost. He explains he operates in what is ""one of the best fishing zones in the west of the island"". But now it is covered with molten rock. The area had already been reeling from the effects of the coronavirus, and Tazacorte was just keeping itself economically afloat when the eruption, the first on La Palma since 1971, hit. Everybody in the village knows somebody who has suffered material loss, from houses engulfed in lava, to their job in a fishing industry left all but paralysed, the same fate befalling those working in agriculture or tourism. ""My son comes back home at night and tells me, 'mum, yet another day I haven't worked as we didn't have a single table'"" to serve, Nieves Acosta, 56, says of her son, a waiter in a restaurant. The Acosta brothers lost their home, the straw breaking the proverbial camel's back to leave her in floods of tears as she and the family battle a rising tide of other problems. ""You talk about the future -- but what future is there?,"" she sobs. ""If there is no fishing then agriculture is hit, more than hit. What will become of our children?"" - Rain of ash - The eruption brought dozens of journalists and scientists to rake over the island but their excited curiosity is in stark contrast to the serious and lined faces of locals. ""Here, people were happy but now they are hanging their heads,"" says Cristina Sanchez, who lives in the nearby commune of Los Llanos de Aridane. The ""rain of ash"" from the volcano ""is driving me insane,"" says Nieves, who works at a retirement home and who is taking a break over a coffee with Jesus, a friend who has just lost his job at a banana export firm. Massive swathes of banana plantations dominate the scenery in Tazacorte -- exports of the fruit are one of La Palma's main earners. Nieves, who refuses to give her surname, says she has little hope for the future after the volcano ""destroyed everything.""   She says she just hopes that ""when it's all over people will come, that's they will all come"" and help put the shattered community back together again.

Grand Duke George Mikhailovich Romanov tied the knot with Victoria Romanovna Bettarini, an Italian, at St. Isaac's Cathedral in Russia's former imperial capital St Petersburg. Russian Orthodox clergy conducted the elaborate ceremony, watched by hundreds of guests who included the groom's mother, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia - the self-proclaimed heir to Russia's imperial throne - and more than a dozen minor European royals. George Mikhailovich's great-grandfather, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, fled Russia during the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, escaping first to Finland and later relocating with his family to Western Europe. Russia's last tsar, Nicholas II, his wife and five children were murdered by a revolutionary firing squad in July, 1918, in the cellar of a merchant's house in Yekaterinburg, a city 1,450 km (900 miles) east of Moscow. George Mikhailovich, 40, was born in Madrid and has lived most of his life in Spain and France. Bettarini, 39, who converted to the Russian Orthodox faith last year and took the name Victoria Romanovna, was led to the altar by her father, Roberto Bettarini, who has served in the Italian diplomatic service. George Mikhailovich visited Russia for the first time in 1992 and moved to Moscow in 2019, where he works on a number of charity projects. The Romanov dynasty ruled Russia for over 300 years before Nicholas II abdicated in early 1917, setting the country on course for the Bolshevik Revolution in November of that year, civil war and 70 years of Communist rule.   Russia's Orthodox Church in 2000 canonised Nicholas II, who had been portrayed as a weak leader by Soviet authorities.

The confidential, two-page brief, written in early September by senior international economic officials, said the country's severe cash shortage began before the Taliban took control of Kabul. It was written for the use of donors and lenders, including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It criticised how the central bank's former leadership handled the crisis in the months before the Taliban's conquest, including decisions to auction unusually large amounts of U.S. dollars and move money from Kabul to provincial branches. ""FX (foreign exchange) reserves in CB's (central bank) vaults in Kabul have depleted, the CB cannot meet ... cash requests,"" the report, seen by Reuters, said. ""The biggest source of the problem is the mismanagement at the central bank prior to the Taliban takeover,"" it added. Shah Mehrabi, chairman of the central bank's audit committee who helped oversee the bank before the Taliban took over and is still in his post, defended the central bank's actions, saying it was trying to prevent a run on the local Afghani currency. The extent of the cash shortage can be seen on the streets of Afghan cities, where people have been queuing for hours to withdraw dollar savings amid strict limits on how much they can take out. Even before the shock of the Western-backed government's collapse, the economy was struggling, but the return of the Taliban and abrupt end of billions of dollars in foreign aid has left it in deep crisis. Prices for staples like flour have spiralled while work has dried up, leaving millions facing hunger as winter approaches. AID DRIES UP Under the previous government, the central bank relied on cash shipments of $249 million, delivered roughly every three months in boxes of bound $100 notes and stored in the vaults of the central bank and presidential palace, according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter. That money has dried up as foreign powers shy away from dealing directly with the Taliban, which fought against foreign troops and the ousted government. Thousands of people - many of them civilians - died. The central bank, which plays a key role in Afghanistan because it distributes aid from countries like the United States, said on Wednesday it had finalised a plan to meet the country's foreign currency needs. It gave no details. The hard currency crunch is making it difficult for the Taliban to meet basic needs, including paying for power or dispersing salaries to government employees, many of whom have not been paid in months. Afghanistan's roughly $9 billion of offshore reserves were frozen as soon as the Taliban captured Kabul, leaving the central bank with just the cash in its vaults. According to the report, the central bank auctioned off $1.5 billion between June 1 and Aug. 15 to local foreign exchange dealers, which it said was ""strikingly high"". ""By August 15, the Central Bank had an outstanding liability of $700 million and 50 billion Afghanis ($569 million) towards the commercial banks,"" it said, adding that this had been a major factor in emptying its coffers. Afghan central bank official Mehrabi said, however, that although almost $1.5 billion of auctions had been announced, the actual amount sold was $714 million. He said the central bank had ""continued its foreign exchange auction to reduce the depreciation and inflation."" MONEY MISSING? The report also questioned a decision by the central bank to shift some of its reserves to provincial branches, putting it at risk as Taliban made advances across the country from late 2020 in the runup to their victory. It said around $202 million was kept in these branches at the end of 2020, compared with $12.9 million in 2019, and that the cash was not moved as provinces started to fall to the insurgents. ""Some money is reportedly lost (stolen) from 'some' of the provincial branches,"" the report said, without specifying how much. Mehrabi said the central bank was investigating money ""stolen"" from three of its branches, although not by the Taliban. He gave no further details. Former central bank governor Ajmal Ahmady, who left the country the day after Kabul fell, did not respond to emails and other messages requesting comment on his and the bank's actions in the months before the Taliban returned to power. Ahmady has said on Twitter in recent weeks that he did his best to manage the situation, and blamed any cash shortfall on the freezing of central bank assets abroad.   In his statements, he also said the central bank had managed the economy well prior to the fall of Kabul and that he felt bad about leaving staff behind but feared for his safety. He has said no money was stolen from any reserve account. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

On September 16, late in the night, 25-year-old Rahul Yadav was allegedly set on fire in the Semra Leharia village in the Sagar district, around 170 km from Bhopal. A member of a community classified as an Other Backward Class or OBC, he blamed the Brahmin family of the woman he was in love with in a cellphone video recorded before he died. He named four people including the girl's father, her elder brother and two others. All four were arrested soon after and their house was demolished by authorities. But now, the Madhya Pradesh government seems to have landed in a spot over the move, prompting Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to order a CBI probe and take over the treatment of the treatment of the 23-year-old woman who suffered burn injuries in the incident. ""The Chief Minister has asked for a CBI investigation into the incident. The Chief Minister has also directed us to arrange the best possible treatment for her. She will be shifted to a private hospital,"" Sagar District Collector Deepak Arya said. The case saw its first twist a few days after the incident when the woman claimed that the man accidentally caught fire while trying to set her ablaze at her place, while her family members tried to rescue both of them. She also had her statement recorded before an executive magistrate countering allegations by the man who had said her family members had poured petrol on them and set them on fire. However, by then, Bhupendra Singh, a senior minister and MLA from Sagar came out in support of the demand of the villagers to demolish the house - a practice adopted by the government in crimes deemed ""heinous"". He also visited the village, and announced ₹ 1 lakh compensation for the family of Rahul Yadav and said he would recommend a government job for a family member following protests from the OBC community. This, coupled with the woman's statement, left the Brahmin community up in arms against the BJP government in the state and prompted demands for the resignation of Bhupendra Singh. The Congress too questioned the move with party spokesperson Narendra Saluja saying, ""After the demand from one community, the administration demolished the house. Now, after listening to the other, the government ordered a CBI investigation. They are trying to copy UP by demolishing the houses of criminals, but if it was illegal, then why were you silent? First, they acted and are now talking about an investigation."" The CBI inquiry was announced in Bhopal soon after the dominant community announced it would mobilise one lakh people in a rally against the BJP with less than a month to go for by-elections in a Lok Sabha and three assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh.   There are 26 assembly seats in six districts of the Sagar division in the Bundelkhand region. Sagar district accounts for the maximum eight assembly seats. A by-election is also due in the Prithvipur seat where upper caste communities and OBCs both have a sizeable vote. The seat fell vacant after the death of former Congress minister Brijendra Rathore.

The decision from the centre came after state police chief LM Khaute proposal for a higher-level probe in the matter, Manipur's Special Secretary (Home) H Gyan Prakash said. The Manipur police chief had earlier constituted a team headed by senior state police official Radhashyam Singh, with two other top ranked officials K Kabib and Kamei Angam Romanus to probe the case. Meanwhile, the Manipur government has suspended 16 policemen, including some troopers of Manipur Rifles over the killing. Athuan Abonmai was shot dead soon after he was kidnapped by armed men on September 22 in state's Tamenglong district. The policemen allegedly behaved as mere onlookers while Abonmai was being dragged out and bundled into a waiting jeep. After the widespread condemnation, Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh had publicly apologized for the police inaction during the incident. ""I wondered how the morale of the police had lowered to such an extent. Police should have taken swift action and saved the life of Abonmai,"" Mr Singh, who also holds the home portfolio, had said. Athuan Abonmai was abducted on September 22 when the Chief Minister, accompanied by his ministerial colleagues, visited the Tamelong district bordering Assam and Nagaland to inaugurate some projects.  The tribal leader was reportedly abducted while he was on his way to attend the Chief Minister's programme.   According to reports, 20 armed members allegedly from NSCN (IM), kidnapped Abonmai near Pallong village. Police are yet to ascertain the motive behind the incident with no group claiming responsibility for the kidnapping and killing of the tribal leader."

Two weeks since boys in classes above the sixth grade were told to go back to school, the government says it is working on making it possible for girls to do the same. ""My request to the Islamic Emirate is that girls be allowed to go to school,"" said Marwa, a Kabul schoolgirl, using the term the Taliban use to describe their government. ""Also (female) teachers should be allowed to go to school and teach girls. ""I dreamt of becoming a top doctor to serve my people, my country, and my family and work in the community, but now it's not clear what my future will be,"" she added. The issue has become increasingly important as the rest of the world, whose aid money Afghanistan desperately needs, tries to gauge whether the new Taliban government will give women and girls greater freedoms than the last time it was in power. ""The Ministry of Education is working hard to provide the ground for the education of high school girls as soon as possible,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told a news conference on Sept. 21. The ministry put a statement on its Facebook page on Sept. 24 saying no decision had been reached on when girls would be able to go to school, but that work on the issue was continuing and information would be shared as soon as possible. Girls' education and literacy rates, while still relatively low by world standards and well below the rates for boys, have risen sharply since the last Taliban government was ousted by a U.S.-led campaign in the wake of the September 11 attacks. But increasingly, foreign officials and rights activists including UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai have warned that one of the biggest social gains of the past 20 years may be under threat. Facing a potentially catastrophic economic crisis that will require large amounts of foreign aid, the movement has tried to present a conciliatory face as it seeks to gain international recognition for its government. Officials say they will not repeat the harsh rule of the previous Taliban government toppled in 2001, which banned most girls' education and forbade women from going out in public without a male guardian.   They say all rights for women and girls will be guaranteed in accordance with Islamic law. But they have not said when and under what conditions girls' schools will be allowed to re-open. ""If our Taliban brothers want their government to be stable and the international community to recognise it, according to sharia, they should allow girls to study,"" said Shaima Samih, a 57 year-old maths teacher from Kabul."

This statement comes after India decided to impose reciprocal measures on British nationals under which UK nationals arriving in the country from Britain will have to undergo mandatory quarantine at home or in the destination address for 10 days after their arrival, sources said. ""The UK is continuing to work on expanding the policy to countries and territories across the globe in a phased approach. We are continuing to engage with the Government of India on technical cooperation to expand UK recognition of vaccine certification to people vaccinated by a relevant public health body in India,"" the British High Commission spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson said the UK is open to travel and they are seeing a lot of people going from India to the UK, be it tourists, business people or students. ""Over 62,500 student visas have been issued in the year ending June 2021, which is an increase of almost 30% as compared to the previous year. We want to make the process of travelling as easy as possible."" The step came days after the United Kingdom announced new travel rules which state that Indian travellers, even those who have received both doses of the Covishield vaccine, will be considered unvaccinated. Sources said that reciprocity will come into force from October 4, the same day UK's new travel rules come into effect. ""New regulations will come into effect from October 4, and will be applicable to all UK nationals arriving from the UK,"" a source said. Sources said that from October 4, all UK nationals arriving in India from the UK, irrespective of their vaccination status, will have to undertake pre-departure COVID-19 RT-PCR test within 72 hours before travel, RT-PCR test on arrival at airport and RT-PCR test on Day 8 after arrival. ""UK nationals arriving in India from the UK will have to undergo mandatory quarantine at home or in the destination address for 10 days after the arrival,"" the source said. Sources said that authorities in Health and Civil Aviation ministries will be taking steps to implement the new measures. India had said last month that it will be within its rights to take reciprocal measures against UK's ""discriminatory"" move to recognise AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine but not Covishield if the issue is not satisfactorily resolved.   Even though the new British rules state that AstraZeneca Covishield is among vaccines that qualify as approved, India is not yet on the list of 17 countries mentioned. The 'changes to international travel rules' state that formulations of the four listed vaccines, such as AstraZeneca Covishield, AstraZeneca Vaxzevria and Moderna Takeda, qualify as approved vaccines.

It's where President Joe Biden learned in August that a suicide bomber killed 13 American service members in Kabul. But the Situation Room is also a technology throwback, with some equipment that hasn't been updated in 15 years. Now the Pentagon has proposed shifting almost $46 million previously approved for other programs to accelerate an ongoing overhaul, adding to about $44 million backed by Congress for the project since fiscal 2017 and $10 million requested for fiscal 2022, according to Pentagon budget documents. The Situation Room is actually a series of rooms, a command center on the lower level of the White House's West Wing for the president and senior administration officials to conduct secure briefings and calls. ""Sit Room"" staff provide 24-hour monitoring of international developments, according to the nonprofit White House Museum. A person familiar with the operation, who discussed the secure facility on condition of anonymity, said its staff also connects calls with heads of state and monitors major domestic events. Funds are required for renovations that will ""update the security and technology"" since the last renovation in 2006, including ""audio-visual improvements to enable broadcast quality display and production capability to include flexible infrastructure for rapid upgrades,"" according to a Defense Department budget document for fiscal 2022. The money sought for improvements ""will continue to upgrade and secure critical systems that support classified voice, data and video used in the White House Situation Room and throughout the National Security Council"" for the president, vice president and senior staff, according to the document. Not surprisingly, much of what that spending will support is classified, like the full capabilities of the Situation Room itself. Some of the funding would also upgrade systems used at locations outside Washington, known as ""Continuity of Government"" sites, that were created during the Cold War in case of a catastrophic attack on the nation's capital. The Pentagon request to shift funds to the Defense Information Systems Agency for the Situation Room is part of a ""reprogramming"" request for unspent fiscal 2021 funds that Congress is reviewing. In addition, $10 million is being requested as part of the still-pending fiscal 2022 budget, according to agency spokesman Dillon McConnell. Intelligence agencies also are participating in the upgrade and its funding, the person familiar with the project said. The multilayered system includes equipment such as servers at off-site locations and is protected by layers of backup, encryption and hardening against physical attack, the person said. Tense Moments The Situation Room has been the site of many tense and historical moments since it was created in May 1961 ""out of frustration on the part of President Kennedy after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion,"" according to the White House Museum. During President Donald Trump's term, the White House released an October 2019 photo of him in the Situation Room watching the commando raid that killed al-Baghdadi, the ISIS leader, in Syria. It also has been the site of less momentous events. In December 2017, it's where Trump's chief of staff, John Kelly, fired Trump adviser and former ""Apprentice"" celebrity Omarosa Manigault Newman. Despite the room's reputation for tight security, she secretly taped the conversation. This year, Biden and his team were gathering for an update on the airlift evacuation from Afghanistan when he learned of the Aug. 26 terrorist attack at Kabul airport. ""As the president arrived in the Situation Room, one of the first updates he received, of course, was about the attacks on the ground in Kabul,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at the time. Commanders on the ground and the region, using the secure communications link to the nerve center of the White House, gave Biden briefings as updates rolled in. Most Famous The most famous photo was what then-White House Photographer Pete Souza called ""Frame 210"" taken on May 1, 2011: President Barack Obama and his National Security team watching a live drone video beamed into a laptop and listening to a satellite-radio feed of the Seal Team 6 raid that killed bin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks. The image shows Obama and top advisers crammed together in a small room. Air Force Lieutenant General Brad Webb, who was a one-star general and an Air Force Tech Sergeant for the secretive Joint Special Operations Command, explained in an interview how that came about. Webb, who's now the three-star commander of the Air Education and Training Command, said he was told by White House staff that he wasn't authorized to have access to the president but ""you can set up your stuff. If we have a question, we'll come get you."" So Webb and a tech sergeant operated a laptop in a small annex in the Situation Room complex to monitor the raid in Pakistan. Then ""everybody kind of naturally migrated,"" and ""they float in over the series of the hours,"" he said. First was then-Vice President Biden, who asked ""Hey General, what's going on?"" ""I kind of walked him through what he can expect,"" Webb said. Then ""it kind of got busy,"" Webb said. He said he looked around and found, ""Whoa, everybody's in here,"" including Obama, who let Webb keep his seat. Webb is seen in uniform in the center of the White House photo. ""I spent a lot of time explaining to them what was going to occur"" but ""as more people came in, I just unplugged"" the laptop headset ""so they could hear the audio."" That included the now famous ""Geronimo EKIA"" call sign by a commando on the ground signaling that Bin Laden was dead.   Souza later wrote that ""the president stood up to shake hands with General Webb and a few others"" but ""there was no cheering or fist-bumping. It was an oddly subdued reaction to a historic moment."" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

The conditional usage permit ""is valid until the end of December, by which time the applicant has to provide further data,"" said senior inspector Liisa Kaartinen of the Finnish Food Authority, which oversees veterinary activities. Such conditional permits can be granted during a pandemic when no other vaccine is available. Minks are bred for their fur and have been found at particular risk of contracting the novel coronavirus. ""We have prepared about half a million doses now, which should be enough to vaccinate all animals twice,"" said Jussi Peura, research director at the Finnish Fur Breeders' Association, which developed the vaccine together with researchers from Helsinki University. Because clinical trials have not yet been carried out, the jab cannot be distributed commercially and must be used in conjunction with strict procedures on Finland's 1,000 fur farms to monitor and prevent the spread of the virus. The vaccine approval applies only to Finland, where so far no cases of the novel coronavirus have been identified among minks, and where transmission rates among humans have remained some of the lowest in the European Union. The breeders' association believes its vaccine is the first to receive such approval in the EU. Neighbouring Russia said in March it had registered what it called the world's first animal vaccine against Covid-19, previously tested on dogs, cats, mink and foxes. The mink is the only animal identified so far as being able to transmit Covid-19 to humans.   Denmark, previously Europe's largest exporter of mink pelts, saw its fur industry ravaged after a mutated strain of the virus spread through mink farms last November. All the country's some 15 million minks were subsequently culled. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she would leave parliament after an anti-corruption body announced an inquiry into allegations against her. ""My resignation as premier could not occur at a worse time, but the timing is completely outside of my control,"" Berejiklian told media in Sydney. ""I do not want to be a distraction from what should be the focus of the state government during this pandemic, which is the wellbeing of our citizens. It always has been and always will be."" Berejiklian has been one of the most prominent faces of Australia's pandemic response, fronting cameras daily as the federal government was largely sidelined. A state corruption watchdog is investigating allegations including whether she favoured a former boyfriend, then a member of parliament, in the awarding of grants in his electorate. The projects included funding for the Australian Clay Target Association and the Riverina Conservatorium of Music in Wagga Wagga, a small New South Wales town. Berejiklian denied the allegations and said the inquiry into events that occurred between 2012 and 2018 had come ""in the most challenging weeks of the most challenging times in the state's history"". Since late June, Sydney's over five million residents have been under stay-at-home orders, with plans to end the lockdown slated for October 11. Daily case numbers have begun to decline from a peak earlier this year but the state is still reporting over 800 cases a day. The conservative leader had helmed the state since 2017, including through Australia's worst bushfire season and the entirety of the pandemic. Her approval ratings rocketed in late 2020 as the state managed to avoid the ravages of the first wave, but recent opinion polls had seen her support from voters dip after the arrival of the Delta variant and spiralling lockdowns.   Her replacement will be decided by members of the ruling Liberal party. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

The Delhi Disaster Management Authority issued fresh COVID-19 guidelines on Thursday. Religious places in the national capital were closed for devotees for over five months, since April 19, following the imposition of a lockdown due to the severe second wave of Covid infections. Although the Delhi Disaster Management Authority order permitted the entry of devotees to religious places, it prohibited large gatherings there. It also directed the district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police to ensure strict compliance with Covid-appropriate behaviour in view of the upcoming festivals. The standard operating procedure (SOP) for religious places to ensure precautions against COVID-19 include allowing entry to only asymptomatic persons, use of face masks, avoiding common mats for prayers and staggering devotees among others. ""No physical offerings like prasad distribution or sprinkling of holy water etc to be allowed inside the religious place,"" it stated. Seating arrangements should be made in such a way that adequate physical distancing is maintained. A gap of six feet has to be maintained in queues, and only those with face masks allowed entry. ""Specific markings may be made with sufficient distance to manage the queue and ensure social distancing in the premises. Preferably, separate entry and exits for visitors shall be organised,"" the noms laid out prepared by the Health Ministry stated. Air conditioning and ventilation at religious places should follow guidelines of the CPWD that lay down temperature settings in the range of 24-30 degrees Celsius, relative humidity of 40-70 per cent and intake of fresh air, it said.   Community kitchens, langars, ""ann-daan"" at religious places should follow physical distancing norms while preparing and distributing food.

Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan was jailed last year when he was on his way to report the Hathras gang-rape case that triggered nationwide shock. Thirty-six articles written by Mr Kappan - accused of having links to the Popular Front of India (PFI), an outfit the Yogi Adityanath government wants banned - have been cited in the chargesheet. ""Kerala Union of Working Journalists is shocked to learn that the Uttar Pradesh Police has included the reports and interviews done by Siddique Kappan as a journalist in the chargesheet filed against him. The action of the UP Police is nothing but treating journalism as a crime. This goes against the very spirit of freedom of expression guaranteed under the Constitution,"" the journalists' union said in a statement today. The chargesheet - filed in April by the UP Police's Special Task Force and presented before a Mathura court - has still not been made available to Mr Kappan or his legal representatives, his lawyers have claimed. They have petitioned the trial court, seeking ""true copies of the document to the accused"". One of the articles is on the protests against the controversial citizenship law that started in December 2019 across the country and continued till the pandemic began. ""The article talks about the firing by a Hindu man Kapil Gurjar during the Shaheen Bagh protests and compares this incident to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The article also criticises the way the Delhi Police handled the protests,"" the chargesheet reads. The chargesheet also cites another article on the controversy over the alleged role of the Nizamuddin Markaz in spreading the pandemic, saying ""it has been presented as a ploy by the central government to defame the Muslim community."" In the statement, the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) requested the Supreme Court to intervene and ""quash the shameful act of the UP Police.""   ""The KUWJ is also anguished to learn that the copy of the chargesheet has not been given to Siddique Kappan even though we are on the brink of completing one year of his arrest and subsequent incarceration in jail... The KUWJ would reiterate its support for Mr Kappan and his struggle against the false charges made by the UP Police,"" the journalists' union said. Mr Kappan and three others have been in jail after their arrest in October last year, when they were headed from Delhi to western Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, where a young Dalit woman was gang-raped in September by four men from a so-called upper caste community, eventually leading to her death."

So Why Didn't It Happen? - by @arvindgunasekar https://t.co/2KzPbA64Yi https://t.co/UvThtSiu54,https://www.ndtv.com/blog/blog-why-pk-congress-plans-and-talks-have-stalled-2560290,Blog: PK Was Set To Join The Congress. So Why Didn't It Happen?,"In the middle of July this year, images went viral of political strategist Prashant Kishor entering Rahul Gandhi's residence in central Delhi. It was the first indication that Kishor, considered the architect of a number electoral victories, mainly of regional parties, was in talks with India's main opposition party, making for dizzying headlines. At the time, sources familiar with the developments told NDTV that the July meeting was not the first between Mr Kishor and the Gandhis, and that both sides were working on a arrangement where ""PK"", as he is known, would not serve as a political consultant, but, in fact, formally join the Congress. All this was playing out weeks after PK, in an exclusive interview to NDTV, said that he was retiring as an electoral strategist. So, the fact that he was considering joining politics did not seem unviable; in fact, it seemed like a natural progression from that announcement made on NDTV. The arrangement that the Congress and PK were trying to decide on, NDTV was told, was to work on 'something bigger' than just the upcoming state elections, an ambitious plan to use PK's skills to revive the faltering fortunes of the Congress in the run-up the 2024 general election. And then suddenly, without explanation, things went cold. One explanation for why lies in the revelation of a former Chief Minister of Goa, Luizinho Faleiro, who crossed over earlier this week from the Congress to the Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress (TMC) just months before the coastal state votes for its next government. Speaking to NDTV, Mr Faleiro said that it was PK and his group, I-PAC (Indian Political Action Committee), which had approached him to switch to Mamata Banerjee's party. ""Of course, he had approached me. Just a few days back,"" he said. At a press conference in Panaji, Mr Faleiro was even more explicit. ""Believe it or not , I never met them (Mamata Banerjee and her nephew Abhishek Banerjee). They are great leaders. But I did not meet them. I met I-PAC, I met Mr Prashant Kishor of I-PAC. Just before I took the decision, we had the interaction."" If Mr Faleiro is to be believed, PK was and is helping expand the political footprint of the TMC in areas where the Congress has been enervated, even while he was in talks with the Congress over reviving its fortunes. This possible conflict of interest, some in the Congress say, may have contributed to a certain cooling off in pursuing matters with PK. (Further evidence of the continuing deep ties between PK and the TMC surfaced when it emerged last week that Prashant Kishor, a native of Bihar, was registered as a voter in Bhabhanipur in West Bengal, the constituency being contested by Mamta Banerjee for election to the state legislature). PK's camp, however , points out that he had registered as a voter in Bhabhanipur earlier this year before the state election as a preemptive move after reports suggested that the BJP was considering a move to oust him and his outfit during the poll period from West Bengal on grounds that they were outsiders. PK's outfit is also meant to be working to spearhead the TMC's push in the North East; recently, Congress' Assam MP Sushmita Deb became another high-profile leader to join the TMC. There is a trust deficit, a Congress source told NDTV. Sources close to PK maintain that this is not quite the case, and that I-PAC's continuing work with its other clients was discussed at length in his talks with the Congress leadership. The reason for the pause in talks, as per these sources, is almost solely to do with a disagreement over the timing of PK's entry into the Congress: while the Congress leadership is keen for him to join at once, and begin work on the coming assembly elections in February in states including Uttar Pradesh, PK is adamant that he will only join after those elections. The reason, it was argued, is that the February elections are too close at hand, not giving PK enough time to make the Congress battle-ready in those states. Prashant Kishor reportedly told the Congress top brass that he will be fully on board for all the elections after February, up until and including the big Lok Sabha battle in 2024. The other reason for the possible standstill in the PK-Congress talks could be reservations of some within the Congress over PK's designation and mandate. A four-member Congress panel (comprising Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in place of Ahmed Patel, AK Anthony, KC Venugopal and Ambika Soni), meant to advise Sonia Gandhi on political matters, is said to have sought the views of a large section of the Congress' top leadership on PK's entry. While most were said to be in favour, some leaders are believed to have suggested that PK's designation and role be confined only to managing elections. This, sources close to PK maintain, runs contrary to his talks with the Congress leadership, in which both sides reportedly were in favour of a more sweeping role for PK, one in which he would have been empowered to intervene in almost all aspects of decision-making within the party. Regardless of the conflicting claims, it appears that for now, what was a potential headline-making partnership between India's beleaguered Grand Old Party and a rising political upstart, has come to a standstill.

The top court termed it a “very serious case” and said the laxity with which the state has proceeded in the case “speaks volumes of how State machinery is defending or protecting its own police officers"". It said that the father of the man is running from pillar to post for the last 19 years to ensure that justice is given to him in the case registered against the accused, who were police officers. The top court said that counsel appearing for the father of the man, who is the petitioner before it, has stated that one of the accused who is missing has retired from service in 2019 and he has been paid all his retiral dues even though there was an order for stopping payment of salary. “Such conduct of the respondent/state cannot be understood. The laxity with which state has proceeded in the present case speaks volumes of how State machinery is defending or protecting its own police officers,” a bench of justices Vineet Saran and Aniruddha Bose noted in its order passed on Thursday. The bench noted that the incident is of 2002 and since then, the matter has been pending. The alleged encounter had taken place in Sikanderabad in Bulandshahr district. It said from the record, it appears that a closure report was filed by the police but the same was rejected by the trial court in January 2005. The top court noted that the accused were not even arrested for the next nine months, even though there was no stay of the proceedings. It said in 2018, the trial court had directed the state to stop the payment of salary of the accused but still, the same was not done except in the case of one accused. The bench noted that the order of stopping the salary of the accused was again passed in April 2019, which according to the petitioner has yet not been complied with. “It is noteworthy that it was only after notices were issued by this court in this writ petition on September 1, 2021, that the state machinery geared up in action and have arrested two of the accused persons after 19 years and one accused has surrendered. As regards the fourth accused, it is stated that he is still absconding,” the top court noted in the order. The bench said in the extraordinary circumstances of this case, it has entertained the petition of the father of the man to ensure that justice is given to him. The court noted the submissions of the counsel appearing for Uttar Pradesh that the state is taking every action in the matter and has also initiated an enquiry as to why steps were not taken at the appropriate stage. “Be that as it may, considering the facts of the case as narrated above, and keeping in view the totality of the circumstances and the sufferings which the petitioner has undergone, we direct that the state of Uttar Pradesh deposit a sum of ₹ seven lakhs with the registry of this court towards interim costs within one week from today,” it said. It further said, “On such deposit being made, the petitioner, who is the father of the man, shall be entitled to withdraw the same.”   The bench has posted the matter for hearing on October 20.

The Chief Electoral Officer's (CEO) office had on Thursday said around 68.40 per cent voter turnout was recorded and an updated figure was released on Friday. All arrangements have been made for counting of votes on Sunday, officials said. The voting percentage in the bypoll was more than that in the 2019 and 2014 assembly elections. While the voter turnout in 2019 was 76.37 per cent, it was 77.27 per cent in 2014, sources in the CEO's office said. Opposition BJP leader P Harichandan claimed that the high voter turnout was a clear indication that people wanted a change in Pipili where the BJD's Pradeep Maharathy got elected five times in a row since 2000. BJD leaders, on the other hand, expressed confidence that they would retain the seat. The winning margin in Pipili this time will be more than that of the 2019 elections, BJD vice-president Debiprasad Mishra claimed. Senior Congress leader and MLA Suresh Routray said the party will get a respectable number of votes but will not win. He claimed that the party which has spent more will win the Pipili seat and in terms of expenditure, the BJD is number one followed by the BJP. Though there are 10 candidates in the fray at Pipili, the contest was mostly confined among the BJD's Rudrapratap Maharathy, the BJP's Ashrit Pattnaik and Congress nominee Biswokeshan Harichdan Mohapatra. The by-election was necessitated following the death of BJD MLA Pradeep Maharathy in October last year. The bypoll was first scheduled to be held on April 17 but it was countermanded after Congress candidate Ajit Mangaraj died of Covid-19 on April 14. Then it was slated for May 13 but was deferred due to a festival on that day and rescheduled on May 16. However, once again, it was postponed in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the administration has geared up for the smooth and error-free counting of votes on Sunday, said Puri district Collector Samarth Verma.   Puri Superintendent Of Police KB Singh said, ""While Border Security Force jawans have been deployed in the innermost cordon of the strong room, one platoon of State Armed Police has been deployed in the second layer. For the outer cordon at the warehouse, district police have been deployed.” (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

Switzerland has witnessed numerous anti-vaxxer protests and 42% of its 8.7 million population are not yet fully vaccinated, relatively high by European standards. Announcing what he admitted was an unusual incentive scheme to bring that number down, Health Minister Alain Berset told a news conference in Bern: ""The immunisation rate ...remains very low and this means we cannot end containment measures."" Under the 150 million franc initiative, every newly vaccinated person will be asked to name an individual who convinced them to get the shot, and who will then be sent a 50 Swiss franc ($54) token to cash in at participating cinemas or restaurants. The government said it also planned to announce a national vaccination week, with 170 mobile vaccination centres. Although the number of domestic coronavirus cases is declining, there is still - given the high number of non-immune individuals and the highly contagious Delta variant - a significant risk of another wave of infection that could place a heavy burden on hospitals, the government said.   Switzerland and neighbouring principality Liechtenstein have reported more than 841,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 10,700 deaths. "

There used to be riots during the previous governments, curfew used to be imposed and people could not celebrate festivals, he said, addressing the concluding session of the state working committee meeting of the BJP Yuva Morcha. ""When there were no riots, the administration used to put such strange conditions that there would be no cracker bursting on Diwali or people would not be able to go on Kanwar Yatra,"" Mr Adityanath added. ""But for festivals of a particular community ('varg vishesh'), a red carpet used to be laid. Whenever there were Hindu festivals, they were banned,"" he said. He also referred to the Ram temple which is under construction. ""A grand temple of Lord Shri Ram is being constructed in Ayodhya, and this could only be done by the BJP,"" the chief minister said. Shri Krishna Janmashtami was the only festival that was celebrated in prisons and police stations, but the governments of the SP and the BSP banned it too, he said. ""When we came to power, the first festival was Kanwar Yatra, and officials warned that there could be riots as people from six states come for it,"" Mr Adityanath stated. ""I replied that I have come to stop the riots, you need not worry about this, the responsibility of protecting 24 crore people of the state is on us and Kanwar Yatra will take place. We said we will not stop Kanwar Yatra. All festivals will be celebrated,"" he added. The chief minister alleged that when the SP and the BSP got their chances to govern the state, they only filled their coffers and left the state in the lurch. ""In 15 years, these people changed the direction of UP, changed its fortunes and ended its identity. But within just four and a half years, the BJP-led government has worked to bring the glory of UP back,"" he added. Recently, Mr Adityanath had said that earlier, rations meant for the poor used to go people who say ""abba jaan"", an indirect jibe at the SP and the Muslim community. The chief minister also asked the members of the youth wing of the party to make all-out preparations to connect with the six crore young people in the state.   He appreciated the role played by the Yuva Morcha workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and other calamities.

The top court said in circumstances where other evidence is available to prove or dispute the relationship, the court should ordinarily refrain from ordering blood tests. A bench of Justices R Subhash Reddy and Hrishikesh Roy said that DNA is unique to an individual (barring twins) and can be used to identify a person's identity, trace family linkages or even reveal sensitive health information. ""Whether a person can be compelled to provide a sample for DNA in such matters can also be answered considering the test of proportionality laid down in the unanimous decision of this Court in K S Puttaswamy v. Union of India, wherein the right to privacy has been declared a constitutionally protected right in India,"" the bench said. The top court said the courts should therefore examine the proportionality of the legitimate aims being pursued, i.e whether the same is not arbitrary or discriminatory, whether they may have an adverse impact on the person and that they justify the encroachment upon the privacy and personal autonomy of the person, being subjected to the DNA Test. ""When the plaintiff is unwilling to subject himself to the DNA test, forcing him to undergo one would impinge on his personal liberty and his right to privacy,"" the bench said. The verdict came on an appeal filed by one Ashok Kumar seeking a declaration of ownership of property, left behind by late Trilok Chand Gupta and late Sona Devi. He arrayed the couple's three daughters as defendants in the suit and claimed himself to be the son of Trilok Chand Gupta and Sona Devi. In their written statement, the defendants denied that the plaintiff is the son of their parents (Trilok Chand Gupta and Sona Devi), and as such he is disentitled from any share in their parental property. The defendants also set up an exclusive claim on the property based on the Will dated April 16, 1982, executed by their late mother Sona Devi. During the trial, the defendants filed an application seeking to direct Kumar to undergo a Deoxyribonucleic Acid Test (DNA ) and either of the defendants, to establish a biological link of the plaintiff to the defendants' parents. Kumar opposed the plea and pointed out that he has produced adequate documentary evidence to support his claim.   The trial court dismissed the application saying that the plaintiff cannot be compelled to undergo the test.

The K Palaniswami-led AIADMK government had in September 2018, recommended to then Governor Banwarilal Purohit the release of all the seven persons -- Murugan, Santhan, AG Perarivalan, Ravichandran, Jayakumar, Robert Payas and Nalini -- convicted and undergoing life imprisonment in connection with the assassination of Gandhi during an election rally at nearby Sriperumbudur in May 1991. Nalini Sriharan had earlier also moved the court on the matter. On Friday, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu, before which the petition came up for hearing, ordered notice to the authorities concerned returnable by October 12. Among other things, Nalini Sriharan submitted the Supreme Court had held that the decision of a state is binding on the Governor as per Article 161 of the Constitution. But the Tamil Nadu Governor had failed to act on the decision of the state cabinet taken on September 9, 2018.

He was given a detailed briefing about the overall situation in the region at the headquarters of the 14 Corps, popularly known as the ''Fire and Fury Corps'', that takes care of guarding the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in the Ladakh region, officials said. On the first day of his two-day tour of the region, General Naravane visited the strategically sensitive Rezang-La area and visited a war-memorial there to pay homage to the soldiers who laid down their lives in defending the country, they said. The Chief of Army Staff also called on Lieutenant Governor of Ladakh, Radha Krishna Mathur, and discussed the prevailing security scenario in the Union Territory. ""General Naravane visited several forward areas in eastern Ladakh where he was briefed on the prevailing security situation and operational preparedness. He also interacted with the troops and complimented them for their resoluteness and high morale,"" an Army spokesperson said. His visit to the region came a day after he said that the ""unprecedented"" military standoff with China required an immediate response and large-scale mobilisation of resources at a time when the country was faced with the coronavirus pandemic. ""The unprecedented developments necessitated large scale resource mobilisation, orchestration of forces and immediate response, all this in a Covid-infested environment,"" he said while delivering a lecture at an industry chamber on Thursday. Also on Thursday, India hit out at China for attempting to blame it for the border row and asserted that the ""provocative"" behaviour and ""unilateral"" attempts by the Chinese military to alter the status quo along the LAC in the region seriously disturbed peace and tranquillity. The comments by External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi came in response to China's fresh allegations that the ""root cause"" of the tensions between the two countries was New Delhi following a ""forward policy"" and ""illegally"" encroaching Chinese territory. The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year in eastern Ladakh following a violent clash in the Pangong lake area.  Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry. As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the Gogra area last month.   In February, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in line with an agreement on disengagement. Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector."

The Congress leader, who completed her five-day visit to the state capital on Friday, held meetings with party members in preparation for the electoral test early next year and will address a public rally on October 10 in Varanasi for which preparations are underway, party spokesman Anshu Awasthi said. During her visit to the state, the Congress in-charge of UP affairs held meetings with leaders, office bearers and workers of different units of the party including the Youth Congress and took feedback from them for formulating the party's strategy for the elections, Mr Awasthi said. According to party spokesman Ahmed Khan, a grand rally will be held at the Jagatpur Inter College Ground in Varanasi. UPCC chief Ajay Kumar Lallu has asked all party office bearers to extend their support for making the rally a big success, party sources said. The UP Congress is also working on the details of its 'Pratigya Yatra' and Ms Gandhi is expected to address public meetings along its route especially at the divisional headquarters, the sources added. The Congress is organising the public meeting in Varanasi soon after the resignation from the party of former MLA Lalitesh Pati Tripathi, the great-grandson of former UP chief minister Kamalapati Tripathi, who was considered close to the Gandhi family and had association with the party for four generations. Mr Tripathi's family is considered to be very influential in Varanasi, Chandauli and Mirzapur districts of the state and its members had represented the party in the Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies for long. Lalitesh Pati Tripathi's decision to leave the Congress was considered to be a big setback for the party. Earlier in June, former Union minister Jitin Prasada had resigned from Congress and joined BJP. He was recently sworn in as cabinet minister in the UP government and the governor also nominated him as member of the Legislative Council. The party's state vice-president Gayadin Anuragi joined the Samajwadi Party on Friday. Congress spokesperson Javed Khan said the situation in UP has been deteriorating continuously in the last 32 years and the development of the state has been hampered. He said law and order has completely collapsed and Congress is continuously fighting against the ""anti-people"" policies of the BJP. Ms Gandhi, who had arrived in Lucknow on Monday, attended the state election committee meeting of the party on Thursday where it was decided that the first list of candidates for the 2022 UP assembly polls will be released soon. ""The meeting of the state election committee was held in which it was decided that the first list of candidates will be released soon,"" a senior party leader had said.   The Congress had fought the 2017 assembly polls in alliance with the Samajwadi Party and won only seven of the 114 contested seats with a vote share of 6.25 per cent.

The corporation, however, has claimed the state government was informed of the release of waters. The corporation is equally owned by the Centre, Bengal and Jharkhand governments.

Mr Singh was transferred from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March after Mr Waze's arrest by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The NIA chargesheet in the case has not named Param Bir Singh as an accused but several revelations in the chargesheet could make things difficult for Param Bir Singh. After his transfer to the Home Guard department, the IPS officer made sensational accusations against then state home minister Anil Deshmukh of asking police officers to collect bribes from hotel and bar owners, an allegation the latter denied.   But Mr Deshmukh stepped down from his post subsequently as the CBI registered a case against him. Mr Deshmukh has also not responded to summons by the Enforcement Directorate which is probing money-laundering allegations against him. The ED has asked for help from the CBI to trace Mr Deshmukh. Mr Singh has also been named in at least four extortion complaints and Maharashtra Police Chief Sanjay Pandey recently sent a proposal to suspend Mr Singh and other police officials named in the extortion cases, but the state Home Department has sought more details, news agency PTI reported."

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's office said the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has advised that Coronavac (Sinovac) and Covishield should be considered as ""recognised vaccines"" for the purpose of determining incoming international travellers as being appropriately vaccinated against COVID-19. During a media interaction, visiting Australian Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Dan Tehan said it is wonderful news that his Prime Minister has announced that the international border will be reopening. ""...It means that the pathway for our Indian international students to return to Australia is there again and with semester one starting in February, March next year, those international students will be able to start returning towards the end of this year and the beginning of next year,"" he said. Australia had imposed very strict travel restrictions on people travelling in and out of the country.

The centre on Thursday postponed buying kharif or monsoon paddy from farmers in Punjab and Haryana till October 11. It said crop maturity has been delayed due to recent heavy rains. However, the opposition Congress and farmers have questioned the government's decision to delay buying crops, which was scheduled to start today, as a conspiracy to end paddy procurement at minimum support price (MSP). ""To demand paddy procurement, farmers will protest outside the homes of BJP-JJP MLAs and the office of the collector in Punjab tomorrow,"" Mr Tikait tweeted. Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, during his first meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, asked the centre to start buying paddy from farmers and also discussed the three controversial farm laws against which thousands of farmers have been protesting for nearly a year on the Delhi-Haryana state border. The government's Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state agencies buy crops from farmers. The Congress said a large amount of paddy will go waste if they are not picked up soon. ""Lakhs of quintals of paddy had already started to arrive in mandis from September 20. Eleven days have passed since, then but so far not even a single grain of the crop at MSP has been procured in Haryana,"" Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said today, news agency PTI reported. In Haryana, 20 lakh quintal of paddy is lying at mandis under open skies, Mr Surjewala told reporters. ""This is a clear conspiracy to end paddy procurement at MSP. Arrivals in Haryana began on September 20 and if the government will not procure the crop till October 11, if this is not a conspiracy to end MSP, then what else is it?"" He said.   Farmers from different parts of the country, especially Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting along the state border in Delhi since November last year, demanding repeal of the three farm laws that they fear would do away with MSP eventually, leaving them at the mercy of big firms. The centre has denied the allegations and offered to amend the laws after wide discussions with farmers. The centre says the farm laws are in fact beneficial for farmers as some of the provisions cut out middlemen, who exploit farmers. But the farmers have stuck to nothing less than complete withdrawal of the three laws."

""From October 4, all UK nationals arriving in India from the UK, irrespective of their vaccination status, will have to undertake three COVID-19 RT-PCR tests - within 72 hours before travel, on arrival at the airport, and on Day 8 after arrival, and mandatory quarantine at home or in the destination address for 10 days after arrival in India,"" sources said. Described as discriminatory and even ""colonialist"", the UK government has faced intense backlash over its refusal to recognise visitors as vaccinated unless they received their shots in a handful of select countries. Under travel rules unveiled last month, fully dosed arrivals from several nations are being allowed to enter England without quarantine starting October 4. But vaccinated people from vast swathes of the world still face tougher restrictions, including a 10-day home isolation period. India's Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla called the rules ""discriminatory"" and warned that ""reciprocal action"" may be warranted. The UK adjusted its policy to include the Covishield shot widely used in India as an approved vaccine, but India still isn't on the list of acceptable places to receive a dose. As a result, people who received Covishield in the UK count as vaccinated, while those who got it in India do not. British officials told NDTV last week that the issue was not the vaccine itself but the issues with India's ""vaccination certification"" process and the two sides announced ""progress"" in recognising each other's certificates after high-level talks. Dr RS Sharma, CEO of India's National Health Authority said certification after coronavirus vaccinations in India is a centralised national system managed through the CoWIN app and portal and there are ""no issues"" with the platform which is entirely compliant with World Health Organisation standards.   In a statement on Friday, a spokesperson for the British High Commission reiterated its position saying, ""The UK is continuing to work on expanding the policy to countries and territories across the globe in a phased approach. We are continuing to engage with the Government of India on technical cooperation to expand UK recognition of vaccine certification to people vaccinated by a relevant public health body in India."" ""The UK is open to travel and we're already seeing a lot of people going from India to the UK, be it tourists, business people or students. Over 62,500 student visas have been issued in the year ending June 2021, which is an increase of almost 30% as compared to the previous year.

The lack of dredging in dams and barrages by Jharkhand has led to excessive discharge of water causing the flood situation in Bengal, she said and urged the government of that state to carry out dredging in its reservoirs. Ms Banerjee warned of ""massive protest"" if dredging of dams and barrages is not done to prevent recurrence of floods. Opposition BJP and the Congress said that Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) always apprised the Bengal government before releasing excess water and this time was no exception. Veteran Trinamool MP Sougata Ray shot back, saying ""What BJP or Congress says on the issue is blatantly false,"" and insisted that DVC released water without consulting the West Bengal government. Ms Banerjee said ""If this (flood) would have occured after heavy rainfall we would have understood (the situation) and tackled it. But it took place because of the discharge of water from the dams and barrages by Jharkhand and DVC. I request them to carry out dredging; Bengal cannot keep facing similar situation every time there is heavy rainfall. ""This is absolutely unjust. We have been protesting against this unplanned enhanced discharge from dams and barrages for quite some time. I am protesting against this. This may spiral into a massive agitation, which I do not want,"" she said. The Bengal chief minister alleged that excess water was discharged following heavy rainfall on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday at around 3 am without information. ""This is a crime. If excessive water is released without information in the dead of the night, how will people save themselves? ""The discharge resulted in flooding in Asansol, Bankura and Purulia. Again yesterday, DVC discharged around one lakh cusec of water,"" she said. Ms Banerjee claimed that reservoirs in Jharkhand have not been cleaned in the last 50 years and that her repeated requests for the same were also not heeded. ""If the cleaning processes had been carried out in time, the dams and barrages would have held more water. The problem is if there is heavy rainfall in Jharkhand and Bihar we (Bengal) have to face the consequences,"" she said. Ms Banerjee said that she was sad that the flood took place just before the Durga Puja and affected lakhs of people. She also expressed fear that the situation may deteriorate on Mahalaya day before the pujas when the high tide takes place. Criticising the way the Prime Minister Cares Fund is spent by the Centre, the Trinamool supremo, who is one of the most bitter critics of BJP, requested the common people to contribute to the CM Relief Fund, promising them that assistance from it will reach the affected. ""I will request people to contribute to the CM Relief Fund. It is not PM Cares Fund ... The CM Relief Fund will be used for the right purpose and reach those affected,"" she said. Ms Banerjee also assured the affected people of compensation. ""Do not worry, our government will take care of you. We will compensate for your losses ... Even though we are almost without funds after providing compensation every time. We will continue to provide compensation,"" the Chief Minister said. The Chief Minister said that she will conduct an aerial survey of the flood-affected areas of the state on Saturday. ""If the weather is good I will visit Bankura, Purulia, Bardhaman, Howrah and Hooghly and Medinipur,"" she said. Ms Banerjee said that senior leaders of her party like Firhad Hakim, Malay Ghatak, among others, will supervise the flood-situation in the affected districts where around one lakh people have been evacuated to safe shelters. Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari told reporters that the Chief Minister is ""not speaking the truth"" as any decision on release of water cannot be unilaterally taken by DVC. ""The Hon'ble CM is trying to shift the blame to DVC to hide her government's failure to come to the aid of the people, shift those marooned to safer places and provide relief and rehabilitation. This is her old game,"" Mr Adhikari, who had been a minister in the earlier governments headed by Mamata Banerjee, said. BJP state president Sukanta Majumder said he has WhatsApp image of DVC's intimation to the state before the release of water from its dams. ''If you want I can share the screenshot of that with the media,"" he said. State Congress president Adhir Chowdhury too said the state is always apprised before any release of water from DVC's barrages. ""It is absurd that the state government was not taken into confidence."" Trinamool state spokesman Kunal Ghosh said, ""Adhikari was irrigation minister when he was with the Mamata Banerjee government. We oppose the cheap politics of BJP."" Ms Banerjee had alleged that the flood in early August in parts of south Bengal too were ""man made"", caused by excessive release of water by DVC from its barrages which had hit lakhs of farmers and claimed 16 lives. According to the report of the state irrigation department, water discharged from down Durgapur barrage till 5.30 pm on Thursday was 2,04,000 cusec, while the combined discharge of DVC was 1,00,000 cusec. The report said the combined discharge from Darakeswar and Gandheswari dams at Bankura was 1,20,000 cusec, while it was 3000 cusec from Mayurakshi dam. Tilpara barrage in Panagarh discharged 12,000 cusec, Sikatia barrage on Ajoy river discharged 90,000 cusec and Kangsabati dam 30,000 cusec. Asansol and Bankura recorded their highest rainfall in history in 24 hours till Thursday morning. Asansol in West Burdwan recorded 434.5 mm rainfall, while Bankura town, the headquarter of Bankura district, recorded 354.3 mm rain during the period, it said. Durgapur recorded 200 mm rainfall, Purulia 170 mm, Kangsabati 140 mm and Phulberia 110 mm, it said.

Ridiculing the Congress by calling it a sinking ship, senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari said that Mr Kumar's joining won't make any difference to the party.

""Kanhaiya Kumar's induction won't make any difference. He can't save the party. Congress is a sinking ship and it has no future,"" the RJD leader told reporters. RJD sources said that the party is unhappy with the fact that Mr Kumar was inducted into the Congress without consulting the Tejashwi Yadav-led party. The Congress is a part of the RJD-led opposition alliance Mahagathbandhan that fought the 2020 Bihar assembly elections against the NDA.   Bihar Congress leaders declined to comment on the matter.

If the Congress is eliminated from the political canvass, India's democracy will be without a national opposition, he stressed. In a statement, the veteran BJP leader highlighted the Congress' importance by calling it the only national party in the country after the BJP. ""The chariot of democracy moves on two wheels. One is the ruling party and the other is the opposition,"" Mr Kumar said. The oldest party in the country, once led by the likes of Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi, and Vallabhbhai Patel, has become a ""joke"" of late, he said. Mr Kumar praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing able leadership, but also stressed the importance of a strong opposition in the country. ""Atal ji (Atal Bihari Vajpayee) used to say that we should not always stay in the small walls of parties -- that is why I am saying this while standing in the temple of the nation,"" he added. The 87-year-old leader said the only treatment for the Congress is to come out of the ""slavery"" of the Gandhi family, adding that there is more than one national leader in the party. He also urged former chief minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh to not leave the Congress but sit together with G-23 leaders like Ghulam Navi Azad, Kapil Sibal and Shashi Tharoor to ""fight for freedom"" in the party and break out of the ""bondage"" of one family.   The G-23 referred to by Mr Kumar is a group of Congress leaders who had last year written to Sonia Gandhi, seeking an organisational overhaul of the party.

""From October 4, all UK nationals arriving in India from the UK, irrespective of their vaccination status, will have to undertake three COVID-19 RT-PCR tests - within 72 hours before travel, on arrival at the airport, and on Day 8 after arrival, and mandatory quarantine at home or in the destination address for 10 days after arrival in India,"" sources said. Described as discriminatory and even ""colonialist"", the UK government has faced intense backlash over its refusal to recognise visitors as vaccinated unless they received their shots in a handful of select countries. Under travel rules unveiled last month, fully dosed arrivals from several nations are being allowed to enter England without quarantine starting October 4. But vaccinated people from vast swathes of the world still face tougher restrictions, including a 10-day home isolation period. India's Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla called the rules ""discriminatory"" and warned that ""reciprocal action"" may be warranted. The UK adjusted its policy to include the Covishield shot widely used in India as an approved vaccine, but India still isn't on the list of acceptable places to receive a dose. As a result, people who received Covishield in the UK count as vaccinated, while those who got it in India do not. British officials told NDTV last week that the issue was not the vaccine itself but the issues with India's ""vaccination certification"" process and the two sides announced ""progress"" in recognising each other's certificates after high-level talks. Dr RS Sharma, CEO of India's National Health Authority said certification after coronavirus vaccinations in India is a centralised national system managed through the CoWIN app and portal and there are ""no issues"" with the platform which is entirely compliant with World Health Organisation standards.   In a statement on Friday, a spokesperson for the British High Commission reiterated its position saying, ""The UK is continuing to work on expanding the policy to countries and territories across the globe in a phased approach. We are continuing to engage with the Government of India on technical cooperation to expand UK recognition of vaccine certification to people vaccinated by a relevant public health body in India."" ""The UK is open to travel and we're already seeing a lot of people going from India to the UK, be it tourists, business people or students. Over 62,500 student visas have been issued in the year ending June 2021, which is an increase of almost 30% as compared to the previous year.

In a statement, Mr Amarinder, who was replaced as Chief Minister by Charanjit Singh Channi, said Mr Rawat's remarks were ""were clearly prompted by the pathetic situation the party now found itself in the state after being on a winning spree for four-and-a-half years."" ""We spoke just a day before the CLP (Congress Legislature Party) meeting was called. Mr Rawat told me then there was nothing in the works and even claimed he had not seen any letter sent by 43 MLAs. I am shocked at the blatant way in which he is now lying about this,"" the former Chief Minister said, referring to a meeting of Congress MLAs before he was asked to resign. ""Three weeks before stepping down as Chief Minister, I had offered my resignation to Mrs Sonia Gandhi but she had asked me to continue,"" Amarinder Singh said in the statement, adding the ""humiliating manner"" in which he was pushed into resigning just hours before the Congress meeting, which was clearly convened to oust him, was a matter of public record. ""The world saw the humiliation and the insult heaped on me, and yet Mr Rawat is making claims to the contrary,"" Amarinder Singh said. ""If this was not humiliation, then what was it?"" Earlier on Friday, Mr Rawat had said Amarinder Singh's outburst that he was not treated well by the party was not true. ""It is being said that he was humiliated. I would like to clarify that the party has always given him respect and treated him with high regard,"" Mr Rawat told reporters, amid the spiralling crisis in the Punjab Congress that started with Amarinder Singh's resignation as Chief Minister. ""...Born out of his stubbornness, he was of the belief that he does not need any advice from anyone, including his own MLAs and Minister and party leadership,"" Mr Rawat said, detailing the simmering tension that grew into a crisis eventually. Amarinder Singh yesterday told NDTV he would quit Congress for humiliating him. The Congress leader shocked the party when he went to meet BJP leader and Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi, raising speculation that he might join the BJP. But he has ruled out joining any party, and said he met Mr Shah to discuss farm laws. While resigning as Chief Minister, however, Amarinder Singh had said he would keep ""options open"". In his statement, Amarinder Singh recalled that Mr Rawat himself had publicly said after meeting him that he was satisfied by the Punjab government's track record on the 2017 poll promises. ""The Congress in-charge of Punjab had categorically stated, as recently as September 1, that the 2022 elections would be fought under Captain's leadership and the high command had no intention of replacing Captain. So how can he (Mr Rawat) now claim that the party leadership was dissatisfied with me, and if they were, then why did he deliberately keep me in the dark all this time?"" Amarinder Singh said in the statement. On Mr Rawat's remarks that Amarinder Singh seemed to be ""under some kind of pressure"", the former Chief Minister said the only pressure he had been under for the past few months was that of his own loyalty to the Congress, because of which he ""continued to tolerate insult after insult."" ""If the party did not intend to humiliate me, then why was Navjot Singh Sidhu allowed to openly criticise and attack me on social media and other public platforms for months? Why did the party give the rebels, led by Sidhu, a free hand in undermining my authority? Why was no cognizance given to the uninterrupted spree of electoral wins I handed over to the party through the four-and-a-half years I was in the saddle?"" Amarinder Singh said.   In yet another attack, Mr Rawat said Amarinder Singh's ""proximity"" to Amit Shah puts a question mark his secular credentials. Amarinder Singh's tactical move whose outcome is still unknown comes after persistent gnawing by a section of Congress MLAs seeking a leadership change in the state ahead of assembly election next year. Just two months ago Navjot Singh Sidhu was made the Punjab Congress chief despite objections by Amarinder Singh, who also openly made it known he would oppose any attempt by the party leadership to consider Mr Sidhu for the top post."

Mr Channi, who replaced Captain Amarinder Singh, also requested the Prime Minister to withdraw the centre's decision to postpone paddy procurement in the largely agricultural state from today. ""Agriculture is our main source of income. I have asked the Prime Minister to help find a solution to the deadlock with farmers, who are protesting against the three controversial farm laws,"" Mr Channi told reporters after the meeting. Mr Channi had on Thursday asked the centre to withdraw its letter on changing the date to start paddy procurement from October 1 to 11. The centre's move to postpone procurement of kharif paddy in Punjab and Haryana till October 11 came after crop maturity got delayed owing to recent heavy rain. Crop procurement is undertaken by the central government's agency, Food Corporation of India, along with state agencies. Mr Channi is also likely to meet senior Congress leaders during his visit to Delhi amid the crisis in the Punjab Congress that started with Amarinder Singh's resignation and state party chief Navjot Singh Sidhu quitting from the post.   A Congress coordination panel will be set up for consultations before any major decision is taken by the Punjab government, news agency PTI reported. The decision to form the panel was reached on Thursday after an over two-hour meeting at the Punjab Congress Bhavan between Mr Channi and Mr Sidhu.

""The BJP calls me 'Tukde-Tukde gang.' I am 'Tukde-Tukde' for the BJP, and I will do 'Tukde-Tukde' of BJP. This party considers Godse the father of the nation, not Gandhi. They only praise Gandhi in front of [US President Joe] Biden,"" he told NDTV in an interview. Stemming from allegations of ""anti-national"" slogans raised during a 2016 event at Delhi's premier Jawaharlal Nehru University when he was president of the students' union that are yet to be proven in any court, Mr Kumar has been frequently given the secessionist label by the BJP and its supporters. Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah a ""Nathuram-banai jodi"" in reference to Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi and a hero for many right-wing groups affiliated to the BJP, Mr Kumar said the party's ideology was openly against the father of the nation. ""Like many other youngsters, I feel that it is getting late. The party which has the legacy of winning freedom for the country, to save that freedom, that party must be the strongest. Those who are focussed only on their political career are joining BJP today,"" he said. Mr Kumar also stood in defence of his new party's leadership that has faced searing criticism from within in the wake of a series of crises in states that it governs and an exodus of prominent leaders. ""Criticism of the Congress leadership helps the BJP... Everybody understands that when the country's biggest opposition party is Congress, the more successful Congress will be, the bigger the defeat BJP will face,"" he said. ""All other opposition parties are regional parties. Congress is the only opposition force with a national presence. It always had the potential... (The BJP) can absolutely be defeated... If I did not think they could be defeated, I would have quit the fight,"" Mr Kumar said. ""My interactions with Rahul Gandhi made me feel that he is a compassionate leader... always asked me about my mother's well-being, my father's health. I really appreciate that about him and these are the qualities that attract me. He is sincere, there is a sincerity in his fight. He is a fearless leader who wants the truth to prevail,"" he said.   After nearly two decades of association with the Left, Kanhaiya Kumar joined the Congress on Tuesday at a time when the party has been battling internal strife ranging from its handling of infighting in states like Punjab to comments critical of the leadership by veterans like Kapil Sibal. Mr Kumar said his shift to the Congress mirrored the transition of Indian politics from Left of Centre to the Right of Centre, and that he appreciated the party remained one where senior leaders can have dramatically divergent views."

It also said that allegations are rife within the party and even outside that Ahmed is acting as an ""agent of the BJP"", and that due to his closeness to the chief minister, he is being sponsored to make such comments to cause harm to the Congress, especially during elections. In the notice issued by the grand old party's Assam unit general secretary Bobbetta Sharma, the MLA has been asked to furnish an explanation for his actions to state Congress president Bhupen Borah in three days. Mr Ahmed apparently made the remarks while reacting to reports that said alleged encroachers in Darrang district disrespected the memory of eight people from the area who were killed during the 1983 Assam agitation. The Baghbor MLA claimed that the eight people who died during the 1983 agitation were not martyrs but killers, as they were involved in slaughtering many others. The recent eviction drive that was carried out at Gorukhuti in Darrang district had turned violent, leaving at least two persons dead in police firing and several others injured in clashes. Taking exception to the remarks made by Ahmed, the Assam Congress, in its show cause notice, further said Ahmed had twice earlier made ""communally provocative"" statements and gone against party discipline.   It added that the ""insensitive"" statements made by him have ""great propensity"" to destroy the social harmony of the state.

""While such appreciable policies are being formulated on paper by the MoHFW, the absolutely contradictory conduct of making the Aadhaar details mandatory at the verification stage before administering vaccination on the vaccinator's access page renders such policies a hoax creating serious doubts over the real objective of the Ministry,"" the plea added.

The conditional usage permit ""is valid until the end of December, by which time the applicant has to provide further data,"" said senior inspector Liisa Kaartinen of the Finnish Food Authority, which oversees veterinary activities. Such conditional permits can be granted during a pandemic when no other vaccine is available. Minks are bred for their fur and have been found at particular risk of contracting the novel coronavirus. ""We have prepared about half a million doses now, which should be enough to vaccinate all animals twice,"" said Jussi Peura, research director at the Finnish Fur Breeders' Association, which developed the vaccine together with researchers from Helsinki University. Because clinical trials have not yet been carried out, the jab cannot be distributed commercially and must be used in conjunction with strict procedures on Finland's 1,000 fur farms to monitor and prevent the spread of the virus. The vaccine approval applies only to Finland, where so far no cases of the novel coronavirus have been identified among minks, and where transmission rates among humans have remained some of the lowest in the European Union. The breeders' association believes its vaccine is the first to receive such approval in the EU. Neighbouring Russia said in March it had registered what it called the world's first animal vaccine against Covid-19, previously tested on dogs, cats, mink and foxes. The mink is the only animal identified so far as being able to transmit Covid-19 to humans.   Denmark, previously Europe's largest exporter of mink pelts, saw its fur industry ravaged after a mutated strain of the virus spread through mink farms last November. All the country's some 15 million minks were subsequently culled. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

Funds are required for renovations that will ""update the security and technology"" since the last renovation in 2006, including ""audio-visual improvements to enable broadcast quality display and production capability to include flexible infrastructure for rapid upgrades,"" according to a Defense Department budget document for fiscal 2022. The money sought for improvements ""will continue to upgrade and secure critical systems that support classified voice, data and video used in the White House Situation Room and throughout the National Security Council"" for the president, vice president and senior staff, according to the document. Not surprisingly, much of what that spending will support is classified, like the full capabilities of the Situation Room itself. Some of the funding would also upgrade systems used at locations outside Washington, known as ""Continuity of Government"" sites, that were created during the Cold War in case of a catastrophic attack on the nation's capital. The Pentagon request to shift funds to the Defense Information Systems Agency for the Situation Room is part of a ""reprogramming"" request for unspent fiscal 2021 funds that Congress is reviewing. In addition, $10 million is being requested as part of the still-pending fiscal 2022 budget, according to agency spokesman Dillon McConnell. Intelligence agencies also are participating in the upgrade and its funding, the person familiar with the project said. The multilayered system includes equipment such as servers at off-site locations and is protected by layers of backup, encryption and hardening against physical attack, the person said. Tense Moments The Situation Room has been the site of many tense and historical moments since it was created in May 1961 ""out of frustration on the part of President Kennedy after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion,"" according to the White House Museum. During President Donald Trump's term, the White House released an October 2019 photo of him in the Situation Room watching the commando raid that killed al-Baghdadi, the ISIS leader, in Syria. It also has been the site of less momentous events. In December 2017, it's where Trump's chief of staff, John Kelly, fired Trump adviser and former ""Apprentice"" celebrity Omarosa Manigault Newman. Despite the room's reputation for tight security, she secretly taped the conversation. This year, Biden and his team were gathering for an update on the airlift evacuation from Afghanistan when he learned of the Aug. 26 terrorist attack at Kabul airport. ""As the president arrived in the Situation Room, one of the first updates he received, of course, was about the attacks on the ground in Kabul,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at the time. Commanders on the ground and the region, using the secure communications link to the nerve center of the White House, gave Biden briefings as updates rolled in. Most Famous The most famous photo was what then-White House Photographer Pete Souza called ""Frame 210"" taken on May 1, 2011: President Barack Obama and his National Security team watching a live drone video beamed into a laptop and listening to a satellite-radio feed of the Seal Team 6 raid that killed bin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks. The image shows Obama and top advisers crammed together in a small room. Air Force Lieutenant General Brad Webb, who was a one-star general and an Air Force Tech Sergeant for the secretive Joint Special Operations Command, explained in an interview how that came about. Webb, who's now the three-star commander of the Air Education and Training Command, said he was told by White House staff that he wasn't authorized to have access to the president but ""you can set up your stuff. If we have a question, we'll come get you."" So Webb and a tech sergeant operated a laptop in a small annex in the Situation Room complex to monitor the raid in Pakistan. Then ""everybody kind of naturally migrated,"" and ""they float in over the series of the hours,"" he said. First was then-Vice President Biden, who asked ""Hey General, what's going on?"" ""I kind of walked him through what he can expect,"" Webb said. Then ""it kind of got busy,"" Webb said. He said he looked around and found, ""Whoa, everybody's in here,"" including Obama, who let Webb keep his seat. Webb is seen in uniform in the center of the White House photo. ""I spent a lot of time explaining to them what was going to occur"" but ""as more people came in, I just unplugged"" the laptop headset ""so they could hear the audio."" That included the now famous ""Geronimo EKIA"" call sign by a commando on the ground signaling that Bin Laden was dead.   Souza later wrote that ""the president stood up to shake hands with General Webb and a few others"" but ""there was no cheering or fist-bumping. It was an oddly subdued reaction to a historic moment."" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh, while dealing with a plea filed by All India Practicing Lawyers Council, said the government has the power to consider the grievances raised by the petitioner and take necessary action. ""We direct the concerned respondent authority to decide the representation of the petitioner dated August 31 in accordance with law, rules, regulations, government policy applicable to the case, on the basis of the evidence on record as expeditiously as possible and practicable and keeping in view the allegation that the movie is going to be released on October 8 on YouTube and other platforms,"" it said. The court observed that the petitioner was yet to watch the entire movie, 'The Conversion', and has approached it on the basis of the trailer which was stated to contain provocative content. ""Provocation depends on mental status of a person... We can't issue notice on your provocation,"" said the bench. Counsel representing the petitioner contended that the trailer depicted bias and communal content against a particular religion and the release of the movie should thus be withheld. In its petition filed through lawyer Adil Sharfuddin, the petitioner submitted that the trailer of movie, which was released on YouTube in August 2021, indicated that it has the ""potential of communal polarization amidst of upcoming UP election"".   ""Since the background of the movie has been set out in Benaras, UP. Video of the trailer has received 7300 comments as on September 2021.

The country has been hit by widespread power cuts that have closed or partially closed factories, hitting production and global supply chains. The crisis has been caused by a confluence of factors including rising overseas demand as economies reopen, record coal prices, state electricity price controls and tough emissions targets. More than a dozen provinces and regions have been forced to impose curbs on energy usage in recent months. Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the matter who did not want to be named, reported that Vice Premier Han Zheng had told energy companies to make sure there is enough fuel to keep the country running and that Beijing would not tolerate blackouts. Han, who supervises the nation's energy sector and industrial production, was speaking at an emergency meeting this week with officials from Beijing's state-owned assets regulator and economic planning agency, the people said. ""It is probably a strong signal about how concerned China is regarding keeping industry going, and more importantly, the winter that is just around the corner,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA. Nearly 60 percent of the Chinese economy is powered by coal, but supply in the world's largest coal importer has been disrupted by the pandemic and squeezed by falling imports amid a trade tiff with Australia. As demand for power from factories in China soared utilities were unable to buy enough fuel after prices surged. The country's environmental agenda is further adding to the crisis, with pressure to dampen down coal burning and cap the growth of coal mining after President Xi Jinping pledged his country would become carbon neutral by 2060. Data released on Thursday showed China's factory activity contracted last month for the first time since February 2020, when the country was essentially closed by lockdowns as authorities battled the first coronavirus outbreak. Han's statement raised concerns that already-high commodity prices could surge further. The order ""to me implies that we are in no way on the verge of a cool-off. Rather it looks like it is going to get even more crazy"", Bjarne Schieldrop, an analyst at SEB said. ""They will bid whatever it takes to win a bidding war for a cargo of coal"" or liquefied natural gas. The power crunch prompted banks Nomura and Goldman Sachs to cut their growth forecasts for China this year, expecting more disruptions to production. Factories that supply multinationals such as Apple and carmaker Tesla are among those told to temporarily halt production. ""If Chinese steel and aluminium smelters are going to be shutting down for extended periods, you can be sure that will reverberate through global supply chains,"" added Halley. One factory worker in the industrial hub of Dongguan told AFP this week they were working overnight after being forced to cease daytime production. ""Of course we're unhappy... but we're going along with the hours that the power curbs take place,"" he said.   Chinese coal futures on Thursday surged to a record as the country grapples with shortages of the fuel ahead of a national holiday, with many factories shut for the week-long break.

The rapid resurgence in the greater Seoul area prompted authorities to extend distancing restrictions until Oct. 17, including a ban in the region on dining out after 10 p.m. and gatherings of more than two people after 6 p.m. The country recorded 2,486 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), with the daily tally having topped 3,000 for the first time last week. The daily average exceeded 2,635 over the past week - the highest-ever level and easily more than twice the level a month before, the KDCA said. The capital Seoul and neighbouring regions remain the hotspot, reporting almost 2,000 cases every day for the last week, up about 42% within just one week. ""We're in a very dangerous situation where the virus is spreading surrounding the Seoul metropolitan area,"" said Lee Ki-il, deputy minister of health care policy, speaking during a briefing. The upcoming two weeks is an important period as the government is revamping its anti-virus policy to facilitate a phased return to normal activities starting November, he added. Among new incentives introduced to encourage people to get vaccinated, the deputy minister said wedding ceremonies can be held with up to 199 attendees if they included 150 fully vaccinated people. ""If the vaccination rate constantly rises and the scales of outbreaks are stably controlled for the next two weeks, we should be able to set out on phased back to normal in earnest,"" Lee said. Around 77% of South Korea's 52 million population had received one shot of vaccine as of Thursday, with about 50% fully vaccinated, as the country has quickly ramped up its inoculation campaign despite a shaky start.   The government aims to vaccinate 80% of all adults by the end of October, and is considering introducing a 'vaccine pass' to allow those who have been fully inoculated to use public facilities and travel more freely.

To curb a fast-spreading wave of Covid-19 -- which struck the southern metropolis particularly hard -- residents have been unable to leave home, even for food, and almost all travel in and out of the area was suspended. Almost half of Vietnam's total 790,000 virus cases were reported in the city, along with three-quarters of the country's deaths. But after a gradual fall in cases, soldiers began dismantling road barriers on Friday and removing hundreds of checkpoints that had separated city districts. ""I am happy,"" said Tran Van Vu, who owns a store selling fruit, vegetables and meat and had planned to expand his business before the pandemic. ""During the lockdown our company was affected a lot... we didn't have enough delivery men as they had to be tested every two days and it was costly for the company."" Roads were busy for the first time in months after most businesses were given the go-ahead to reopen and vaccinated people permitted to move freely within the city. Although authorities have kept a ban on travel to other provinces, thousands of families travelling by motorbike gathered at a checkpoint on the way out of the city, hoping to return to their hometowns. Vietnam was once hailed as a model for virus containment, but the country struggled to stop the spread of a fourth wave of infection that began in April in northern industrial parks and quickly travelled south. More than a third of Vietnam's 100 million people were under stay-at-home orders this summer, bringing the country's important manufacturing industry to its knees and breaking supply chains. Its economy suffered its heaviest contraction on record in the third quarter, officials said Wednesday. Factories in industrial parks and goods transportation services are among businesses allowed to open, authorities have said.   Less than 10 percent of Vietnamese are fully vaccinated but Ho Chi Minh City had been allocated the biggest number of jabs with almost all the city's adults inoculated.

This is for the first time after a long period that the AFSPA will not be applicable to two police stations in another two districts -- Lower Dibang and Lohit -- in view of the improved security situation, a home ministry official said on Friday. The Central government in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (28 of 1958) had declared the Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts of Arunachal Pradesh and the area falling within the jurisdiction of four police stations -- two in Namsai district and one each in Lower Dibang and Lohit districts of Arunachal Pradesh bordering Assam as ""disturbed area"" through a notification on April 1, 2021. The ministry has carried out a further review of the law-and-order situation in Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts of Arunachal Pradesh and in the area falling within the jurisdiction of four police stations in other districts of Arunachal Pradesh, bordering Assam recently. ""Now, therefore, Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts in Arunachal Pradesh and the areas falling within the jurisdiction of Namsai and Mahadevpur police stations in Namsai district of Arunachal Pradesh, bordering the state of Assam, are declared as ""disturbed area"" under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 from 01.10.2021 to 31.03.2022 unless withdrawn earlier,"" the notification said.

Mr Mokhiber told NDTV, ""There's an old notion of sovereignty that has been replaced by the evolution of the UN. The old notion of sovereignty is that 'anything that happens within our borders it is up to the government and it's no one else's business'.

He also said that the key concerns for India at this juncture included whether Afghanistan will have an inclusive government and that Afghan soil is not used for terrorism against other states and the rest of the world. Speaking virtually at the annual leadership summit of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) on Thursday, Mr Jaishankar also suggested that India was in no hurry to deliberate on giving any recognition to the new dispensation in Kabul. In an interactive session with former American ambassador Frank Wisner, the External Affairs Minister also said that the Quad or Quadrilateral coalition comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan is not against any country and it should not be seen as some kind of ""ganging up"" and a negatively driven initiative. India and the US are on the same page on many issues relating to the recent developments in Afghanistan including apprehensions about the possible use of Afghan soil for terrorism. ""I think, to some degree, we would all be justified in having levels of concern and to some degree, I think the jury's still out. When I say levels of concern, you know, there were commitments which were made by the Taliban, at Doha, I mean, the US knows that best I mean, we were not taken into confidence on various aspects of that,"" he said. ""So whatever, whether deal which was struck in Doha, I mean, one has a broad sense. But beyond that, you know, are we going to see an inclusive government? Are we going to see respect for the rights of women, children, minorities?"" he asked. ""Most important are we going to see an Afghanistan whose soil is not used for terrorism against other states and the rest of the world, I think, these are our concerns,"" Mr Jaishankar added. He said what had happened in Afghanistan, is going to ""have very, very significant consequences for all of us, and we are so close to the region."" The minister said that the key concerns were captured by a UN Security Council resolution in August and that how those questions are addressed today is still an open question, which is why ""I said the jury is still out"". ""If you ask me is this the time to draw sharp conclusions, I would sort of take my time and study this with a certain degree of deliberation, because as I said, a lot of this, whatever understandings, there have been, many of these are not known to the entire international community,"" he added. To another question on how India and the US looked at the situation in Afghanistan, Mr Jaishankar said both sides are on a similar page, at a principle level on many of the issues, particularly on the possible usage of Afghan soil for terrorism. He said the issue figured in discussions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden in Washington last week. ""Again, look, there would be issues on which we would agree more, there would be issues on which we would agree less. Our experiences in some respects are different than yours (the US). You know, we have been victims of cross border terrorism ourselves from that region,"" Mr Jaishankar said. ""And let us say that has shaped in many ways, our view of some of the neighbours of Afghanistan. So now, how much, the US shares that view, and where is it that the US sort of makes its tactical compromises I think that is for the Americans to figure out,"" he said. Asked whether it included a joint signal to Pakistan, he only said: ""There are aspects that we share, and there are aspects where maybe our positions are not exactly the same."" To a query on Quad and ways to manage the rise of Chinese power, Mr Jaishankar said the four-nation partnership is not against somebody. ""I think it's very important not to be sort of railroaded into some kind of negative discourse, which actually is not from our script, it is somebody else's script. And I don't think we should fall for that. I think we need to be positive,"" he said. On the question of how to deal with the rise of China, Mr Jaishankar said: ""I would say, in many ways, those are bilateral choices that all of us have to make, we each have a very substantial relationship with China."" ""And, in many ways, China being today is such a big player and so salient in the international economy, I think it's natural that these relationships are quite unique. So what are my problems, or my opportunities would not be the same as that for the US, or Australia, or Japan, or Indonesia or France,"" he added. Mr Jaishankar said it would be different for each country and added that the rise of China has had a very fundamental impact on the international order. ""So as participants in the international order, we need to assess that and respond to that, in the light of our own interest. So I think it's sort of essential to look normalise this conversation,"" he said.   ""You know, this should not end up as though it's some kind of ganging up and a negatively driven event, I don't think that's the fair description of what is a completely natural evolution of the international order to my mind,"" he added.

Bloomberg had reported earlier that salt-to-software conglomerate would re-acquire the national carrier more than half a century after ceding control to the government. ""Media reports indicating approval of financial bids by Government of India in the AI disinvestment case are incorrect,"" the finance ministry said on Friday, adding the media will be informed of any decision ""as and when it is taken."" Tata Group and SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh in his private capacity had bid for the embattled state-run Air India earlier this month. In December 2020, the government had invited expression of interest for the divestment of Air India. Four bidders had entered the race to take over the beleaguered airline, but Tata Group and Spicejet CEO Ajay Singh were the only ones to make it to the final stage. This has been the second attempt by the PM Modi-led government to sell Air India. The centre had made an unsuccessful attempt to sell the ailing airline earlier in March 2018. However, its expression of interest to sell 76 per cent stake in Air India had no takers at that juncture due to concerns regarding the airline's burgeoning debt.   Air India has accumulated losses of over ₹ 70,000 crore and the government loses nearly ₹ 20 crore to run the national carrier every day, according to reports. The beleaguered airline, which one ruled the India skies, began to lose ground with the advent of private carriers in the 1990s and the emergence of no-frill airlines in the mid-2000s. The merger with the state-owned domestic airline Indian Airlines in 2007 proved to be the final nail in the coffin, for Air India. But despite its precarious finances, Air India still controls more than 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports, and 900 slots overseas. And the winning bidder will not only hold 100 per cent stake in Air India and its low-cost arm Air India Express, but also a 50 per cent stake in ground handling company Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited (AISATS)."

The Congress leader shocked the party when he went to meet BJP leader and Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi, raising speculation that he might join the BJP. But he has ruled out joining any party, and said he met Mr Shah to discuss farm laws. ""Amarinder Singh seems to be under some kind of pressure,"" Mr Rawat said. While resigning as Chief Minister, Amarinder Singh had said he would keep ""options open"". ""He was at the forefront of Punjab Congress for years and the party always respected his leadership, so he should have stood by the party when certain decisions were taken,"" Mr Rawat said, alluding to the party's decision to appoint Charanjit Singh Channi to the top post. ""When the question is about saving India and democracy, it was expected of Amarinder Singh ji to stand by Sonia Gandhi ji in this time of need,"" Mr Rawat said. Amarinder Singh's tactical move whose outcome is still unknown comes after persistent gnawing by a section of Congress MLAs seeking a leadership change in the state ahead of assembly election next year. Just two months ago Navjot Singh Sidhu was made the Punjab Congress chief despite objections by Amarinder Singh, who also openly made it known he would oppose any attempt by the party leadership to consider Mr Sidhu for the top post. After Charanjit Singh Channi was made Chief Minister over a week ago, Mr Sidhu also resigned as Punjab Congress chief, plunging the party into a full-blown crisis. ""Despite continuous reminders from his colleagues and the leadership, unfortunately, Captain Amarinder failed to keep his promises on important issues like Bargadi, drugs, electricity, etc. There was a general perception throughout the state that Captain and the Badals are helping each other, and they have a secret understanding.

At least five times I discussed these issues with Captain sahib but no result,"" Mr Rawat said in a statement today.   ""...Born out of his stubbornness, he was of the belief that he does not need any advice from anyone, including his own MLAs and Minister and party leadership,"" Mr Rawat said, detailing the simmering tension that grew into a crisis eventually. ""In a democratic party, all the democratic procedures were followed, and the party chose a Chief Minister who comes from a humble background.

Bloomberg had reported earlier that salt-to-software conglomerate would re-acquire the national carrier more than half a century after ceding control to the government. ""Media reports indicating approval of financial bids by Government of India in the AI disinvestment case are incorrect,"" the finance ministry said on Friday, adding the media will be informed of any decision ""as and when it is taken."" Tata Group and SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh in his private capacity had bid for the embattled state-run Air India earlier this month. In December 2020, the government had invited expression of interest for the divestment of Air India. Four bidders had entered the race to take over the beleaguered airline, but Tata Group and Spicejet CEO Ajay Singh were the only ones to make it to the final stage. This has been the second attempt by the PM Modi-led government to sell Air India. The centre had made an unsuccessful attempt to sell the ailing airline earlier in March 2018. However, its expression of interest to sell 76 per cent stake in Air India had no takers at that juncture due to concerns regarding the airline's burgeoning debt.   Air India has accumulated losses of over ₹ 70,000 crore and the government loses nearly ₹ 20 crore to run the national carrier every day, according to reports. The beleaguered airline, which one ruled the India skies, began to lose ground with the advent of private carriers in the 1990s and the emergence of no-frill airlines in the mid-2000s. The merger with the state-owned domestic airline Indian Airlines in 2007 proved to be the final nail in the coffin, for Air India. But despite its precarious finances, Air India still controls more than 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports, and 900 slots overseas. And the winning bidder will not only hold 100 per cent stake in Air India and its low-cost arm Air India Express, but also a 50 per cent stake in ground handling company Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited (AISATS)."

The chargesheet - filed in April by the UP Police's Special Task Force and presented before a Mathura court - has still not been made available to Mr Kappan or his legal representatives, his lawyers have claimed. They have petitioned the trial court, seeking ""true copies of the document to the accused"". Thirty-six articles written by Mr Kappan - accused of having links to the Popular Front of India or PFI, an outfit the Yogi Adityanath government wants banned - have been cited in the chargesheet. One of the articles is on the protests against the controversial citizenship law that started in December 2019 across the country and continued till the pandemic began. ""The article talks about the firing by a Hindu man Kapil Gurjar during the Shaheen Bagh Protests and compares this incident to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The article also criticizes that way the Delhi Police handled the protests,"" the chargesheet reads. Another article cited is on Sharjeel Imam, an activist facing a terror case over his alleged role in the northeast Delhi riots last year, saying it promotes feelings of communalism. ""During a riot, when you take the name of only a particular community and publish incidents related to that community, members of that community get enraged. Responsible reporters do not indulge in such communal reporting, but Siddiqui Kappan's journalism was only meant to incite Muslims and to further the agenda of the PFI that wants to provoke riots and communal feelings,"" it reads. The chargesheet also cites another article on the controversy over the alleged role of the Nizamuddin Markaz in spreading the pandemic, saying ""it has been presented as a ploy by the central government to defame the Muslim community."" The chargesheet calls the articles ""a collaboration with members of SIMI and an attempt to legitimize the banned outfit's agenda"". However, Wills Mathews , Mr Kappan's lawyer, called it one-sided and highlighted how Mr Kappan, the other accused and their legal counsels have not been provided with authorised copies of this chargesheet even a year after the journalist's arrest. ""Mr Kappan has nothing to hide. He even volunteered to undergo Narco analysis or brain mapping tests to prove his innocence. Even after a full year of Kappan's arrest and six months after the chargesheet was filed in court, we have still not received it,"" Mr Mathews said in a statement. Mr Kappan and three others have been in jail after their arrest in October last year, when they were headed from Delhi to western Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, where a young Dalit woman was gang-raped in September by four men from a so-called upper caste community , eventually leading to her death. Mr Kappan and the others have been charged under the stringent anti-terror law and other sections of the Indian Penal Code. All of them say they have been framed by the police.   In August, a Mathura court dismissed the UP Police's plea to interrogate Kappan again about some incriminating document found at his Delhi residence. Additional District and Sessions Judge Anil Kumar Pandey rejected the Special Task Force plea, saying that the accused cannot be allowed to be interrogated again after the chargesheet in the case has already been filed, news agency PTI reported."

Sources indicated that Mr Channi is now ready to drop Mr Sahota as the police chief.   Mr Sidhu was also upset about the key Home Ministry being assigned to Mr Randhawa, his rival. He had earlier strongly opposed any talk of elevating Mr Randhawa as Chief Minister following Amarinder Singh's resignation.

In line with the vision of the Prime Minister, Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation 2.0 have been designed to realise the aspiration to make all cities garbage free and water secure, according to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). At an event at the Ambedkar International Centre in Delhi, the Prime Minister launched the flagship missions. These missions signify a step forward in the march towards effectively addressing the challenges of rapidly urbanising India and will also help contribute towards achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030, the Prime Minister's Office said. Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 envisions to make all cities 'garbage free' and ensure grey and black water management in all cities other than those covered under AMRUT, make all urban local bodies open defecation free+ and those with a population of less than one lakh as open defecation free++, thereby achieving the vision of safe sanitation in urban areas. The mission will focus on source segregation of solid waste, utilising the principles of 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle), scientific processing of all types of municipal solid waste and remediation of legacy dumpsites for effective solid waste management, the PM's Office said. The outlay of Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 is around ₹ 1.41 lakh crore, it said. The Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation or AMRUT 2.0 aims at providing 100 per cent coverage of water supply to all households in around 4,700 urban local bodies by providing about 2.68 crore tap connections and 100 per cent coverage of sewerage and septage in 500 AMRUT cities by providing around 2.64 crore sewer or septage connections, which will benefit more than 10.5 crore people in urban areas, the PMO said. AMRUT 2.0 will adopt the principles of a circular economy and promote conservation and rejuvenation of surface and groundwater bodies, it said. The mission will promote data-led governance in water management and technology sub-mission to leverage the latest global technologies and skills, it said. The outlay of AMRUT 2.0 is around ₹ 2.87 lakh crore, the PMO statement said. Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban and AMRUT have contributed significantly to improve the urban landscape during the last seven years, PM's Office has said. The two flagship missions have augmented the capacity to deliver basic services of water supply and sanitation to the citizens,it said. ''Swachhta'' has become a jan andolan today, all urban local bodies have been declared open defecation free and 70 per cent solid waste is being scientifically processed now, the PMO said. AMRUT has been ensuring water security by adding 1.1 crore household water tap connections and 85 lakh sewer connections, thus benefiting more than four crore people.   Union Minister for Housing & Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State for Housing & Urban Affairs Kaushal Kishore as well as ministers of urban development of several states and union territories were also present on the occasion.

A panel of ministers accepted a proposal from bureaucrats, who recommended the conglomerate's bid ahead of an offer from entrepreneur Ajay Singh, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified as the decision isn't yet public. An official announcement is expected in coming days, two of the people said. A civil aviation ministry spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A finance ministry spokesperson couldn't immediately be reached. A representative for Tata Sons declined to comment. The proposed handover is a key victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has embarked on a bold privatization plan to plug a widening budget deficit. It also puts an end to a decades-long struggle to offload the money-losing flag carrier. Multiple governments have tried to sell the airline -- which began life as Tata Airlines in 1932 -- but those attempts were either met with political opposition or a lack of interest from potential buyers. For Tata Sons, the holding company for the salt-to-software empire and owner of British luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, the recommendation means it's coming back to an asset it started almost 90 years ago. Established by legendary industrialist and philanthropist J.R.D. Tata, who was India's first licensed pilot, the airline originally flew mail in the 1930s between Karachi in then-undivided, British-ruled India and Bombay, now known as Mumbai. Once it turned commercial and went public in the 1940s, Air India quickly became popular with those who could afford to take to the skies. Its advertisements featured Bollywood actresses and passengers were treated to champagne and porcelain ashtrays designed by surrealist painter Salvador Dali. However, with the advent of private carriers in the 1990s, and then a rush of low-cost, no-frills airlines in the mid-2000s, Air India lost its edge in both domestic and international markets. The carrier, known for its Maharaja mascot, suddenly wasn't the only option for flying overseas and its reputation for impeccable service and hospitality began to ebb. Gulf carriers, including Emirates Airline and Etihad Airways PJSC, also began to offer seamless, and cheaper, connections to Europe and the U.S. via their hubs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, hurting Air India even further. After Air India merged with state-owned domestic operator Indian Airlines Ltd. in 2007, losses started to mount and by 2013, the country's then-Civil Aviation Minister said privatization was key to its survival. In 2017, the government approved that route and a committee was set up to start the process. This most-recent sale attempt hasn't been easy either. IndiGo, the only airline to have publicly shown interest in buying parts of the carrier, dropped out of the reckoning in 2018, saying it didn't have the wherewithal to acquire Air India in its entirety and make it profitable. Ultimately that time around there were no bidders and the government had to sweeten the deal by allowing suitors to decide how much of the carrier's debt they wanted to take on. Even so, politicians belonging to Modi's own party and unions have resisted the plan. For Tata Group, Air India adds a third airline brand to its stable, considering the conglomerate already holds a majority interest in AirAsia India and Vistara, a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd. The Economic Times newspaper had previously reported that Tata may emerge as the winning bidder. Air India -- which hasn't turned a profit since its 2007 merger with Indian Airlines and is now saddled with a debt of around 600 billion rupees ($8.1 billion) -- does have some attractive assets, including prized landing and parking slots at London's Heathrow airport, which may help Vistara lure business travelers with direct flights to Europe. The purchase, once it goes through, will be a test of the group's aviation acumen. Tata Group has faced criticism for not running its existing aviation businesses efficiently, even though they represent a tiny portion of overall revenue.   Cyrus Mistry, who succeeded Ratan Tata as chairman of the conglomerate but was later ousted in India's most high-profile boardroom coup, raised the alarm in an October 2016 letter, saying he pushed backed against both airline ventures.

""We, therefore, modify our order dated March 22, 2021, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) shall first issue communications to each of the fair price shop holders, informing them of the particulars of the ration cardholders, who have opted to receive their rations at their doorsteps and, only thereafter, the rations, to the extent that they are being supplied to such options, need not be supplied to the fair price shop holders,"" the Court said.

""The GNCTD should publicize, for the benefit of the beneficiaries under the PDS scheme, the essential terms and conditions of this order,"" the bench said. The Court listed the matter for further hearing on October 22.   The Court was hearing a petition filed by Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh Delhi challenging the tenders issued towards implementation of the Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna. Delhi Government has submitted that an overwhelming majority has opted for a supply of rations at their doorstep. Delhi Government submitted that it would, therefore, necessarily have to curtail the supplies to the members of the petitioner association to the extent the rations have to be supplied at the doorsteps as per the options called for by the GNCTD, as the petitioner cannot be given rations for distribution even in respect of those who have opted for the supply of rations at their doorsteps."

This will be Mr Channi's first meeting with PM Modi after the senior Congress leader took oath as Punjab chief minister recently. Mr Channi is also likely to meet senior Congress leaders during his visit to the national capital amid the ongoing tumult in the party's Punjab unit, sources said. According to a senior Punjab government official, Chief Minister Channi will meet Prime Minister Modi. Sources said in his meeting with Modi, Channi is likely to urge the Centre to immediately start paddy procurement in the state. The Punjab chief minister on Thursday urged the Centre to withdraw its letter on postponing the paddy procurement in the state from October 1. Paddy procurement usually commences from October 1. Mr Channi had sought the prime minister's personal intervention in advising the ministry concerned to withdraw its letter forthwith, allowing the state to start paddy procurement from October 1 instead of October 11, according to an official statement on Thursday. The Centre on Thursday postponed procurement of Kharif paddy in Punjab and Haryana till October 11 as the crop maturity is delayed owing to recent heavy rains. Crop procurement is undertaken by the central government's nodal agency Food Corporation of India along with state agencies. Charanjit Singh Channi is also expected to meet his party's senior leadership in Delhi. A coordination panel will be set up, which is expected to be consulted before any major decisions by the Punjab government in future. The decision to form the panel was reached earlier on Thursday after an over two-hour meeting at the Punjab Congress Bhavan between Mr Channi and Navjot Singh Sidhu, who had tendered his resignation from the post of the state party chief on Tuesday. The panel would comprise the chief minister, Navjot Singh Sidhu and a representative of the All India Congress Committee, sources said. Mr Sidhu on Wednesday had raised questions over the appointments of the DGP, the state's advocate general and ""tainted"" leaders. Sources said that Sidhu has been backing senior IPS officer Siddharth Chattopadhyay to be appointed as the DGP. Meanwhile, the Punjab government has suggested the names of 10 officials to the Union Public Service Commission for the appointment of a regular director general of police. The names include Chattopadhyay, present DGP Dinkar Gupta and Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, VK Bhawra, sources said. Mr Sahota was a week ago given the additional charge of the Punjab DGP after incumbent DGP Dinkar Gupta proceeded on leave. On Thursday, Mr Sidhu had reached Chandigarh from Patiala to meet Mr Channi. The meeting came a day after Mr Channi reached out to him and offered to resolve issues through talks.   Just before his meeting with the chief minister, Mr Sidhu attacked Mr Sahota, alleging that the new DGP had wrongly indicted two Sikh youths in a desecration case and gave a clean chit to the Badals.

They also said the princess is suffering from a form of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Kyodo news agency reported - echoing the situation of Empress Masako, who for years has struggled with what has been termed an ""adjustment disorder."" Mako will leave the royal family upon her marriage, as is customary. None of the ceremonies that usually accompany a royal marriage will take place, and the princess will forgo a one-off payment of a million dollars to which she is entitled, media reports have said. The couple will register their marriage at a local government office, with records of the imperial family adjusted to reflect that Princess Mako has left it, reports have said. The controversy over the pair's marriage started when a tabloid reported claims by a former fiance of Komuro's mother that the mother and son had failed to repay a debt of about $35,000. Komuro has said his mother's former fiance provided the money as a gift, not a loan. The scandal spread from tabloids to regular news media and gained still more life when imperial family members were prompted to speak out. Komuro himself issued a detailed statement this year. Komuro completed studies at Fordham Law School this year and took the bar exam that will enable him to practice law this summer. He has secured a job as a clerk in a law office in the United States, according to media reports. He flew into Tokyo late on Monday for his first visit in three years, sporting a ponytail that set off widespread tabloid and television discussion about whether he was being disrespectful.   A recent poll by the daily Mainichi showed 38% of respondents supported the marriage, while 35% opposed it, and 26% expressed no interest.

""Very pathetic"" is how the Kerala State Legal Services Authority (KeLSA) report to the High Court describes the condition of the lake spread over an area of around 1,700 sq km, surrounded by swaying coconut groves and palm trees, and spotted by several small islands. The report also said that sewage from nearby residences and government establishments was the main reason for pollution of the lake and also for putting its unique wetland ecosystem under risk of permanent damage. According to the Kerala Tourism website, cruises would give a ""deeper look at the heart and spirit of the backwaters."" ""The 8 arms or channels of the Ashtamudi Lake are what gave it its name. It is the entrance to the famous backwaters of Kerala and the houseboat rides here are extremely famous. The Kollam to Alappuzha route is considered among the best in the backwaters. Cruises here give you a deeper look at the heart and spirit of the backwaters,"" the tourism site claims. However, the ground reality is something else according to local resident KM Salim, who told PTI that no one would want to walk alongside the ""highly polluted"" lake let alone go for a ""cruise"" on it when it is reeking with the smell of decades worth of municipal solid waste and sewage. Incidentally, based on his letter sent to the Kerala High Court, it decided to examine the issue, initiating a public interest litigation on its own and asking KeLSA to inspect the water body that is the second largest lake in the state. Mr Salim further said that tourism too has contributed to the lake's pollution as effluents from the house boats are also discharged into the water body. District Judge and KeLSA Member Secretary KT Nisar Ahammad, who inspected the lake, told PTI that the filth and garbage floating in the lake and choking its ecosystem -- which includes thousands of years old Mangrove trees -- also consists of ""legacy waste"" dumped there over the past several years. On being asked whether the filth in the lake was being termed as such due to it being the legacy we are leaving for future generations, he laughed and said, ""Maybe"". The judge further said that people do not realise that polluting the water body could very well affect the underground water in the area and eventually general public health in the long run. ""This situation is not just confined to Ashtamudi lake, it is prevalent in many other places in the state. People don't realise that the quarrying of mountains and dumping of filth in rivers and lakes would have serious environmental consequences. There has to be awareness on this issue,"" he said. The judge further said that with a little bit of effort the corporation could have cleaned up some portion of the lake, especially the part close to the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus stand where the situation is really bad, but no one, including the local body, appeared to be bothered. He said that a few years back the government had sanctioned funds for cleaning up the lake, but it never took off and now there was another project, worth over ₹ 100 crore, in play for the same purpose. Mr Salim said that the garbage and filth were being dumped in the area for years and as a result, more than 100 species of fishes, mangroves, coconut groves and palm trees that are part of that ecosystem were being adversely affected. A resident of the area for decades, he remembers his younger days when, along with his friends, he used to take a dip in the lake. ""Now you cannot even dare to dip your hand in the water as, if you do, you could end up having rashes or blisters or some other infection,"" he said. Even fish like Karimeen found in the lake no longer taste the same as they used to during his younger days when Ashtamudi was not as polluted as it was presently, he said. ""You cannot walk along the lake side without your olfactory senses being overwhelmed by the stink emanating from there,"" he added. Photographs attached along with the KeLSA report, filed through advocate Santhosh Mathew, show all kinds of garbage and waste floating in the lake, along with the house boats, turning its colour to a murky green. In some photographs, which according to the judge ""speak volumes"", the water body looks more like an open drain and less like a lake whose borders are also lined in many places with garbage. What is more anguishing regarding Ashtamudi, other than the inaction of the local bodies and their contribution in polluting the lake, is the fact that despite being a Ramsar site -- a wetland site designed to be of international importance under Ramsar Convention which is also known as the ''Convention of Wetlands'' -- nothing was being done by anyone to remedy the situation, both the judge and Mr Salim said. The Convention, an intergovernmental environmental treaty adopted in 1971 by UNESCO and which came into force in 1975, provides for national action and international cooperation regarding the conservation of wetlands and wise sustainable use of their resources, according to the KeLSA report. The report by KeLSA further states that inspection of the lake revealed that the main reason behind its pollution was the direct dumping of sewage into it from the nearby government institutions, residences and a public toilet, very near to the water body, meant for passengers arriving at the KSRTC bus stand close by.   It also said that while the Secretary of the District Panchayat denied dumping of sewage waste in the water body from a nearby district hospital, ""the fact remains that the lake is highly polluted and its present condition is very pathetic."" Pollution of water bodies, like Ashtamudi Lake, in this manner was a ""common scenario"" in the whole of Kerala, the report stated."

In 2014, a key sub-section was not included after an amendment to the law in one of the most stringent provisions - Section 27 A, which ""details the punishment for financing illicit trafficking of drugs as 10 years"". The provision has been used in several high-profile cases including the arrest of actor Rhea Chakraborty last year in the drugs case linked to death of actor Sushant Rajput. The error was found and fixed after the recent seizure of three tonnes of heroin worth ₹ 15,000 crore in Gujarat's Mundra Port where the provision has been invoked for illegal drug trafficking. Stressing that the change cannot be applied retrospectively, Rhea Chakraborty's lawyer Satish Manshinde told NDTV: ""The Ordinance is to correct the blunder that was committed while it was promulgated earlier. Though this has been done to correct the law and the mistake that had crept in, this is not retrospectively applicable to cases pending before September 30 as it carves out a new punishment for those who may be encompassed by the amendment. Only procedural laws are prospective whereas punitive laws can not under any circumstances be retrospective..."" The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was enacted in 1985 ""to make stringent provisions for the control and regulation of operations relating to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances"".  A year later, the Narcotics Control Bureau was set up under the Home Ministry as an anti-narcotics drug law enforcement agency. The 1985 law has been amended at least thrice - in 1989, 2001 and 2014. In 2014, however, a new term - ""essential narcotics drug"" as sub section (viiia) - was introduced to the Section 2 of the law. An essential narcotics drug was defined as ""narcotic drug notified by the central government for medical and scientific use"" at the time. With this amendment, the earlier sub section (viiia) - ""illicit trafficking"" of drugs with clauses (i to v) - was renumbered (as sub-section viiib). As the law describes, illegal trafficking of drugs is an important section in the NDPS Act as it deals with the ""production, manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transportation, warehousing, concealment, use or consumption, import inter-state, export inter-State, import into India, export from India or transhipment, of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances"" apart from financing of these activities. The most stringent provision of the NDPS Act is Section 27 A which details ""punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders."" Section 27 A of the NDPS Act reads as follows: ""Whoever indulges in financing, directly or indirectly, any, of the activities specified in sub-clauses (i) to (v) of clause (viiia) of section 2 or harbours any person engaged in any of the aforementioned activities, shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may extend to twenty years and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to two lakh rupees.""   With the re-numbering of illicit trafficking of drugs from sub-section (viiia) to (viiib) in the 2014 amendment, the same was not incorporated in Section 27 A of the NDPS Act. While Section 27-A details the punishment for financing illicit trafficking of drugs as 10 years, it derived the definition of the ""illicit trafficking"" offence from the wrong provision of the NDPS Act."

The farmers' body, Kisan Mahapanchayat, had sought permission from the Supreme Court to hold a 'Satyagrah' at Jantar Mantar, the designated protest site in the heart of Delhi. The group sought the top court's direction to the authorities to provide space to at least 200 farmers or protestors at the Jantar Mantar for organising a peaceful and non-violent 'Satyagrah'. ""You have strangulated the entire city, now you want to come inside the city. The residents around, are they happy with the protest? This business should stop,"" a bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said. The Supreme Court told the group that once they have approached the court against the three farm laws, they should have trust in the judicial system and let the matter be decided. ""If you have faith in courts, pursue that for urgent hearing instead of protesting. Are you protesting against the judicial system also?"" the court asked. ""You block highways and then say protest is peaceful. Citizens also have their rights to move around. Their properties are being damaged. You are affecting security also. You stopped defence personnel also,"" Justice Khanwilkar said. ""We have not blocked highways. The police has detained us there,"" the lawyer representing the farmers' body told the Supreme Court. The court asked the group to file an affidavit saying they are not a part of the protest that is ""blocking the national highways"". In July, farmers, led by two other groups - Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) and Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) - held a massive protest at Jantar Mantar amid the monsoon session of parliament.   Farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders for over a year against the centre's three agricultural laws. Even after 11 rounds of talks, government and farmers have not yet reached a conclusion on three farm laws, which the protesters say will leave at the mercy of corporates. Delhi had witnessed violent protests during a farmers' tractor parade on Republic Day as thousands of agitators clashed with the police."

But now, cryptocurrency experts across the world are talking about a lesser-known cryptocurrency Cardano, terming it to be the one to watch out for. Cardano, with its native virtual currency ADA, became the third-largest cryptocurrency in the world in August, this year. Presently, it has a market cap estimated to be around $72 billion (roughly ₹ 5,31,416 crores) and is topped by only Bitcoin and Ether on the chart. And, it looks like things are only getting better for cryptocurrency. Currently, its virtual currency (ADA) surpasses Bitcoin and Ether, following a 1000% increase in its value during 2021. What works in Cardano's favour is the fact that it is one of the few highly valued cryptocurrencies that have ""sustainable"" properties. This is of relevance at a time when conversations around the sustainability of cryptocurrency have led to a fall in the value of big players like Bitcoin. Bitcoin even lost favour with erstwhile-supporter, SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who cited lack of sustainability as a reason to dump it in favour of Dogecoin.  ADA is sustainable because of its blockchain protocol. So unlike Bitcoin, Cardano does not rely on supercomputers to generate new ADA units and process transactions.  Cardano is based on what is known as a “proof-of-stake” system. Here miners are required to place their cryptocurrency as a ‘stake', to validate a transaction. This, in turn, makes Cardano's power consumption just a minuscule percentage of the Bitcoin network's usage. According to Cardano's official website, the cryptocurrency is on the way to having a “similar capitalisation to that of the technological giants”. A statement on the site adds, “It might be fair to compare blockchain projects with the current technology giants like Microsoft, Apple and, Amazon.”   Additionally, Cardano also recently saw the ‘Alonzo hard fork' upgrade. Nearly two weeks ago, the software upgrade was put in place to allow users to create and deploy “smart contracts” on the Cardano blockchain.  The upgrade is also expected to allow Cardano to host use cases such as Decentralized finance (DeFi), thereby improving ease of transaction and business.  On September 27, as of 10.40 am, Cardano's value in Indian is ₹ 179."

As countries from Italy to Canada lift restrictions, travel resumes and colder temperatures set in, influenza will probably start circulating as well. That's after measures to thwart COVID-19 such as masks and ventilation kept the flu at bay for the past year and a half. Efforts have already been under way to lessen the potential strain on health systems dealing with both illnesses. A UK study released late Thursday showed that it's safe for people to get Covid and flu shots at the same time, which might help increase vaccine uptake and cut down on appointments as the country rolls out booster doses. ""This is a real concern for policy makers,"" Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist whose models are used by the UK government, said at a conference in Paris. ""It's highly likely we will continue to see circulation of reasonably high levels of Covid through the winter, and having seasonal flu on top could pose again significant additional burdens on health systems."" Ferguson and others at the meeting said vaccination in rich countries means there probably won't be a surge in deaths from the coronavirus, but that waning protection from those shots and other factors could still mean plenty of people end up in the hospital. Meanwhile, flu immunity may also have diminished among the general population after two winters with few cases, according to Arnaud Fontanet, an epidemiologist who advises the French government. Concern about withering Covid protection prompted Israel -- one of the first countries to start vaccinating early in the year -- to begin administering booster shots months ago. ""It was pretty striking for us to see early on that a majority of our severe cases were among fully vaccinated individuals,"" said Ran Balicer of Israel's Clalit Research Institute. Britain began offering boosters to people age 50 and over and other vulnerable groups last month. Giving flu shots at the same appointment would make it easier for both patients and the health service, said Rajeka Lazarus, a consultant in infectious diseases and microbiology and chief investigator for the UK report released on Thursday. The study -- involving researchers at the University of Bristol, and University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust -- showed that side effects from getting the vaccines at the same time were mild to moderate, with no negative impact on the immune response to either shot. It involved 679 adult volunteers at National Health Service sites in England and Wales who were due for their second dose of either the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE or AstraZeneca Inc. vaccines. They were divided at random into two groups to blindly receive different combinations of shots or a placebo in opposite arms over two visits between April and June. The results haven't yet been peer-reviewed. Results from the British study provide a strong indication that people can safely receive their booster doses with a flu shot, according to Lazarus. Ferguson presented data at the Paris conference showing that the shot from AstraZeneca and its partner, the University of Oxford, protected less than Pfizer-BioNTech's against the delta variant. Like Israel, he said the UK had seen ""clear evidence of waning protection"" from both shots against mild disease as well as more severe outcomes. After two doses, the Astra shot offers 52% protection against mild symptomatic disease caused by delta, compared with 90% for the Pfizer one, according to Ferguson's data.   Delta may have turned SARS-CoV-2 into ""one of the most transmissible respiratory viruses we have ever seen,"" with a reproduction rate between 6 and 9, he said.

COVID-19 shot and India-made AstraZeneca Plc jabs, paving the way for overseas travelers and fee-paying foreign students who have received those vaccinations to enter the country. The nation's top drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, said the shots should be ""recognized vaccines"" in determining incoming travelers as being inoculated, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday. Australia is starting to unwind some of the world's most intense pandemic border restrictions as vaccination rates across the country approach as key threshold of 80%. Recognition of Beijing-based Sinovac's shot, which has been approved by the World Health Organization for emergency use, contrasts with the U.K. and neighboring New Zealand, which are yet to endorse it. A number of European countries have said they will accept the vaccine, known as Coronavac, as part of programs for vaccinated entry. The U.S. indicated similar when it announced plans to open entry to most vaccinated foreigners last week. Friday's announcement potentially opens the door to thousands of foreign students that have been shut out of Australia during the pandemic. International education is a lucrative source of revenue for the country, worth A$14.6 billion ($11 billion) to the state of New South Wales alone in 2019. ""Very soon, we'll be able to open those international borders again,"" Morrison told reporters. ""This will start happening from next month."" Vaccines made by Sinovac and the state-owned Sinopharm are among the most used in China, and have efficacy rates ranging from around 50% to 80% in preventing symptomatic Covid, lower than the mRNA vaccines developed out of the U.S. Sinovac is also one of the most-deployed Covid shots globally, used from Indonesia to Brazil and Turkey. Chile said earlier this week it would start administering it to children age six to 11. Covishield, also recognized Friday, is the name of the AstraZeneca Plc shot made by Serum Institute of India, the world's biggest vaccine maker.    More than 57,000 students are estimated to be overseas, according to the government of New South Wales. Chinese nationals are Australia's biggest source of international students followed by those in India, Nepal and Vietnam, according to the Australian Trade Department. The decision Friday could also be seen as a potential olive branch from Australia, which has been on the receiving end of criticism and trade blockages from China since it asked for a global inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus."

Minister Says ""We're Searching""","Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh, whose handling of the bomb scare near the home of India's richest man Mukesh Ambani earlier this year has raised questions and is facing a series of extortion cases, is missing, Maharashtra Home Minister Dilip Walse Patil has said. ""Along with the Union Home Ministry, we're also searching for his whereabouts. I've heard something like that but as a government officer, he can't go abroad without government clearance. We've issued a Lookout Circular and if he went away, then it is not good,"" Mr Patil said, on reports of Mr Singh fleeing to Russia. ""Whether it is a minister, officer, or Chief Minister, there are limitations and without the permission of the government of India one cannot go outside the country. No one can cross these limitations. What action can be taken will have to be discussed with the centre. Maharashtra government is looking for him and once he is found we will decide,"" the Home Minister added. On February 25 this year, an SUV with gelatin sticks was found at Carmichael Road, near the residence of Mukesh Ambani. The car belonged to Mansukh Hiren whose body was later found in the Kalwa creek in Thane. A police officer, Sachin Waze, was named as the prime conspirator in the case of planting the explosives and the subsequent murder of Mansukh Hiren. Mr Waze was known to be close to Param Bir Singh and had direct access to him despite being just an Assistant Police Inspector. Mr Singh was transferred from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March after Mr Waze's arrest by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The NIA chargesheet in the case has not named Param Bir Singh as an accused but several revelations in the chargesheet could make things difficult for Param Bir Singh. After his transfer to the Home Guard department, the IPS officer made sensational accusations against then state home minister Anil Deshmukh of asking police officers to collect bribes from hotel and bar owners, an allegation the latter denied.   But Mr Deshmukh stepped down from his post subsequently as the CBI registered a case against him. Mr Deshmukh has also not responded to summons by the Enforcement Directorate which is probing money-laundering allegations against him. The ED has asked for help from the CBI to trace Mr Deshmukh. Mr Singh has also been named in at least four extortion complaints and Maharashtra Police Chief Sanjay Pandey recently sent a proposal to suspend Mr Singh and other police officials named in the extortion cases, but the state Home Department has sought more details, news agency PTI reported."

Reopening the international border for citizens and permanent residents will be linked to the establishment of home quarantine in Australia's eight states and territories, Morrison said, meaning that some parts of the country will reopen sooner than others. The first phase of the plan will focus on citizens and permanent residents being allowed to leave Australia, with further changes expected to permit foreign travellers to enter the country. ""It's time to give Australians their lives back. We've saved lives,"" Morrison said during a televised media conference. ""We've saved livelihoods, but we must work together to ensure that Australians can reclaim the lives that they once had in this country."" Morrison slammed the international border shut in March 2020. Since then, only a limited number of people have been granted a permit to leave the country for critical business or humanitarian reasons. Citizens and permanent residents have been allowed to return from abroad, subject to quota limits and a mandatory 14-day quarantine period in a hotel at their own expense. There have also been a few high-profile exceptions granted for entry for business purposes, including Hollywood actors to film movies and TV shows. Morrison said he expects the first home quarantine systems to be up and running in November, but the timetable will be set by individual states and territories. He has previously said it wants all state and international borders reopened when the national vaccination rate for people aged over 16 reaches 80%, expected by the end of next month. However, a Delta variant-fuelled outbreak that has locked down the major cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra for weeks has divided state and territory leaders. Some presiding over virus-free parts of the country have indicated they will defy the federal plan. Under the plan announced on Friday, Australians who are fully vaccinated will be able to travel abroad and complete a 7-day quarantine at home on their return. People who are not vaccinated will be required to undertake 14 days of quarantine at a hotel when they return. Morrison said his government was working towards quarantine free travel with countries such as New Zealand when ""safe to do so"". An Australian government source said plans were being discussed to allow foreign visitors to enter the country, but it was not possible to yet state a timetable. Vaccine Approval Australia's strict border closure has been credited with keeping both fatalities and infections relatively low. It has recorded just over 107,000 COVID-19 cases and about 1,300 deaths since the start of the pandemic. The country on Friday reported 2,084 new COVID-19 cases, the bulk of which were detected in New South Wales and Victoria states. The results marked a small decline in case numbers from those reported one day earlier, but authorities warned against complacency. Australia will also expand its list of authorised COVID-19 vaccines, allowing thousands of citizens and permanent residents still abroad to return via the home quarantine system, Morrison said.   Australia currently only recognises vaccines produced by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. The source said China's Sinovac and Covishield, a version of AstraZeneca's vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India, would be added to the list.

The week-long registrations, usually a festive event with big crowds, will be more sober this year with restrictions in place to fight one of Asia's deadliest COVID-19 epidemics. Pacquiao, who was joined by his wife and running mate, house deputy speaker Lito Atienza, submitted his certificate of candidacy to the poll body without fanfare, before saying a few words to the media about his plans should he get elected. ""My priority is to resolve the pandemic so we can drive the economy to recovery,"" said Pacquiao, who was wearing a maroon polo shirt and a white face mask with his and the Philippine flag's image. On his way to the registration building, Pacquiao was greeted by dozens of supporters waiting by the roadside and waving banners that read ""Fight, Pacman."" Pacquiao said he was unperturbed by the results of an opinion poll showing him in fourth spot among preferred presidential contenders, saying: ""The voices of the poor have not been heard."" One of the greatest boxers of all time and the only man to hold world titles in eight different divisions, Pacquiao retired from boxing in September to run for the presidency. He is a two-term congressman and currently senator. The registration process should put an end to months of speculation over who will vie to succeed firebrand President Rodrigo Duterte, 76, who under the constitution cannot seek re-election and will contest the vice presidency race instead. Aside from Pacquiao, two other contenders have declared their intention to run for president. Manila Mayor Francisco ""Isko Moreno"" Domagosoa former actor, and Senator Panfilo Lacson, an ex police chief, were expected to file their certificates in the following days. But the spotlight will be on Sara Duterte-Carpio, the president's daughter, despite her ruling out running for the office next year. Duterte-Carpio, 43, replaced her father as Davao City mayor when he became president, and she remains by far the most popular presidential prospect, according to successive opinion polls this year. Analysts say it is crucial her father's successor is a loyalist, to insulate him from potential legal action at home or by the International Criminal Court, over the thousands of state killings in his war on drugs since 2016. Critics say his interest in the vice presidency is also a self-preservation move. Duterte says his motivation is public service, not power. Vice president, Leni Robredo, who leads the opposition, is also being urged by supporters to run for the top post. ""In the coming days, please pray with me so that our decision will be what is best for our country,"" she said. More than 60 million Filipinos will vote in May 2022 for a new president, vice president, and more than 18,000 lawmakers and local government officials.   Candidates have until Oct. 8 to register, but withdrawals and substitutions are allowed until Nov. 15, leaving scope for last-minute changes of heart, like the 11th hour entry of Duterte for the 2016 election, which he won by a huge margin.

The Air Force officer who had accused her colleague of rape had alleged she was discouraged from filing a complaint, subjected to the two-finger test - which is banned - by the IAF (Indian Air Force) doctors, and questioned about her sexual history.

On the day of the assault, about two weeks ago, the woman said, she had injured herself while playing. She then took some medication before going to sleep in her room. She woke up later that to find she had been sexually assaulted. Police said they had acted only after having been told the woman officer was unhappy with the Air Force's handling of her complaint.   The accused was arrested on Sunday amid objections from his lawyer. ""The Coimbatore Police don't have powers to arrest an Air Force officer,"" the police was told by the lawyer, who also presented his case before the court.  Amid outrage, an IAF statement on Thursday read: ""The IAF is cooperating with the police investigation and is also conducting an internal inquiry. We cannot comment any further as the matter is subjudice."""

The term “Altcoins” is derived from the term “alternative coins” and refers to cryptocurrencies that are alternatives to Bitcoin. There are over 5,000 “alternative"" currencies, most of which are Bitcoin and its functionalities. Of the many altcoins, Litecoin is a cryptocurrency that closely resembles Bitcoin. In fact, Charlie Lee, founder of Litecoin, referred to it  as the “silver to Bitcoin's gold.” Litecoin also shares the same codebase as Bitcoin. That's not all. This resemblance even extends to the price moments and market behaviour of the two cryptocurrencies. And this resemblance is intentional, given that Litecoin was developed on the model of Bitcoin. As per the founder, there was a conscious effort to ensure that Litecoin follows Bitcoin. This means that when there is a rise in Bitcoin rates, a simultaneously high is also recorded in Litecoin value. The intention to have Litecoin as a shadow for Bitcoin was made keeping in mind the transaction fee. For Bitcoin, the transaction fee for moving large amounts of money and also small amounts of money is the same. These could seem unfeasible for smaller transactions, create a market for the usage of Litecoin, with regard to the smaller transactions. However, such dependence on one currency can also cause issues. For instance, if the price of Bitcoin sees a slump, it will lead to a crash in Litecoin prices as well. As Litecoin shares the same codebase with Bitcoin and mimics its market movement, an issue with the Bitcoin network can also adversely affect Litecoin's value.    On September 27, 2021 (as of 4.00 PM) the price of Litecoin in India is Rs 12,074. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is valued at ₹ 4,53,462. "

The great-grandmother in Kerala, southern India, has been a driving force in the revival of kalaripayattu, as the ancient practice is also known, and in encouraging girls to take it up. ""I started kalari when I was seven years old. I am 78 now. I am still practising, learning and teaching,"" the matriarch of the Kadathanad Kalari Sangham school, founded by her late husband in 1949, told AFP. ""When you open the newspapers, you only see news of violence against women,"" she said. ""When women learn this martial art, they feel physically and mentally strong and it makes them confident to work and travel alone."" Kalari, which contains elements of dance and yoga, can involve weapons such as swords, shields and staffs. Reputedly 3,000 years old, and mentioned in ancient Hindu scriptures, it remains infused with religion in the present day. India's British colonial rulers banned the practice in 1804 but it survived underground before a revival in the early 20th century and after independence in 1947. In recent decades it has come on in leaps and bounds, thanks in no small measure to Meenakshi, who won a national award in 2017. Now it is recognised as a sport and practised all over India. Inside Meenakshi's kalari hall, her bare-chested son Sanjeev Kumar, a lungi tied around his waist, puts barefoot pupils -- boys and girls alike -- through their paces on the ochre-red earth floor. ""There are two divisions in kalaripayattu -- one is that kalaripayattu is peace and the other is kalaripayattu in war,"" said the ""gurukkal"" (master). ""It's an art that purifies mind, body and soul, improves concentration, speed and patience, regenerates physical and mental energy. ""When totally connected mentally and physically to kalari, then the opponent disappears, the body becomes eyes."" ""It's a form of poetry,"" said civil engineer Alaka S. Kumar, 29, daughter of Kumar and the mother to some of Meenakshi's many great-grandchildren.   ""I am going to teach kalari, with my brother. We have to take over. Otherwise it is gone.""

Bilateral trade was around Aus$24 billion (US$17 billion) last year, with India exporting is key services sector and Australian coal going the other way. Both are members of the Quad alliance with the United States and Japan, and are looking to deepen strategic ties to counter China as well as economically and in other areas. Following trade ministers' talks in New Delhi, the two countries backed the ""expeditious negotiation"" of a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement. In the meantime they plan to reach an ""early harvest"" interim deal by the end this year under which some duties will already be cut. The two sides hope for a ""balanced trade agreement that encourages expanded trade and investment flows to the benefit of both of our economies, and that reflects a shared commitment to the rules-based international trading system"", the statement said. India was Australia's seventh-largest trading partner and sixth-largest export market in 2020. Negotiations on a comprehensive deal between India and Australia were launched more than a decade ago but stalled in 2015. In recent months New Delhi has also sought to revive trade talks with other countries including the United States, the European Union and Britain. Indian media quoted Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan as saying that trade could double in the coming years if the comprehensive accord is sewn up. ""And it will double in all areas because the complementarity between our economies is so great,"" Tehan was quoted as telling a news conference in India on Thursday. Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said the two nations ""have a very positive interest in expanding trade, which could be kick-started or which could be implemented in the interim, while the contours of the final agreement may take a little longer period of time"". Using a cricket analogy, he added: ""This is like a T-20 match, that is why (there are) such aggressive timelines.

""Along with the Union Home Ministry, we're also searching for his whereabouts. I've heard something like that but as a government officer, he can't go abroad without government clearance. We've issued a Lookout Circular and if he went away, then it is not good,"" Mr Patil said, on reports of Mr Singh fleeing to Russia. ""Whether it is a minister, officer, or Chief Minister, there are limitations and without the permission of the government of India one cannot go outside the country. No one can cross these limitations. What action can be taken will have to be discussed with the centre. Maharashtra government is looking for him and once he is found we will decide,"" the Home Minister added. On February 25 this year, an SUV with gelatin sticks was found at Carmichael Road, near the residence of Mukesh Ambani. The car belonged to Mansukh Hiren whose body was later found in the Kalwa creek in Thane. A police officer, Sachin Waze, was named as the prime conspirator in the case of planting the explosives and the subsequent murder of Mansukh Hiren. Mr Waze was known to be close to Param Bir Singh and had direct access to him despite being just an Assistant Police Inspector. Mr Singh was transferred from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March after Mr Waze's arrest by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The NIA chargesheet in the case has not named Param Bir Singh as an accused but several revelations in the chargesheet could make things difficult for Param Bir Singh. After his transfer to the Home Guard department, the IPS officer made sensational accusations against then state home minister Anil Deshmukh of asking police officers to collect bribes from hotel and bar owners, an allegation the latter denied.   But Mr Deshmukh stepped down from his post subsequently as the CBI registered a case against him. Mr Deshmukh has also not responded to summons by the Enforcement Directorate which is probing money-laundering allegations against him. The ED has asked for help from the CBI to trace Mr Deshmukh. Mr Singh has also been named in at least four extortion complaints and Maharashtra Police Chief Sanjay Pandey recently sent a proposal to suspend Mr Singh and other police officials named in the extortion cases, but the state Home Department has sought more details, news agency PTI reported."

The newly wrought peninsula had doubled in size to 20 hectares (50 acres) since the morning, according to the Volcanic Institute of the Canaries (Involcan). While the feared explosion and clouds of toxic gases released as the molten rock hit the ocean have not materialised, a forecast change in wind may bring new hazards, the Pevolca volcanic emergency committee warned. ""With the weather we are going to have from tomorrow,"" marked by a possible change in the direction of winds that have so far dispersed the gases towards the sea, it is possible ""the smell of sulphur"" will be felt ""with greater intensity"", Pevolca official Ruben Fernandez said. Sulphur dioxide levels increased for the first time on Thursday afternoon in Tazacorte, while the ash particles increased in density in Santa Cruz de La Palma, according to the National Institute of Toxicology. Since it began on September 19, the dramatic eruption has forced thousands out of their homes, while lava has destroyed hundreds of houses, businesses and huge swathes of banana plantations. The volcano spewed out rivers of lava that slowly crept towards the sea, eventually pouring into the Atlantic Ocean late on Tuesday. Since then, the rivers of molten rock have not stopped cascading into the sea, creating a growing lava delta. While the initial impact on the flora and fauna of being submerged under the river of molten rock is devastating, over the longer term, it may prove beneficial -- bringing minerals from the Earth's core to the surface and providing a habitat both underwater and on land for colonisation by species, experts said. Fernando Tuya, a biodiversity researcher at the University of La Palma, said: ""The lava will form a rocky platform that will become a substrate for numerous marine species in the future, that is to say in three to five years."" As the white-hot lava poured into the sea, it sent plumes of acid fumes into the air that experts said could irritate the skin, eyes and respiratory tracts. But fears it could affect the local population were quickly allayed as strong winds dispersed the vapours over the sea. However that could change with the wind direction predicted to turn around on Friday. Disaster zone Some 300 residents in the nearby town of Tazacorte have been told to stay at home to avoid any chance of inhaling the gases and a 3.5-kilometre (two-mile) exclusion zone remained in place, which also extends two nautical miles out to sea. ""Until we know that these areas are not at risk, these measures will be maintained,"" Pevolca's Ruben Fernandez said on Wednesday evening. La Palma has been declared a natural disaster zone, with the lava scorching its way across 476 hectares of land, the local government said on Twitter. It has so far destroyed 855 buildings, an increase of more than 200 in just over 24 hours, the EU's Copernicus observation programme said on Twitter. The eruption of La Cumbre Vieja has forced some 6,000 people to flee their homes but so far, nobody has been injured or killed. Although the volcano is still erupting, La Palma's airport resumed operations on Wednesday after flights were suspended at the weekend due to the ash. On Thursday, farmers were allowed to access their plantations outside the security zone to collect bananas -- the chief cash crop on the island.   La Cumbre Vieja lies about 15 kilometres (nine miles) west of the airport as the crow flies, although the lava has only spilt down the western side of the volcano.

There is a buzz that the three-member committee might comprise Harish Chaudhary, the Chief Minister and Mr Sidhu.  A compromise was on the cards since yesterday after the Chief Minister reached out to the sulking party chief, who quit on Monday after disagreeing with the Chief Minister's choice for his cabinet, state police chief and the Advocate General.  His advisers Thursday said it was no more than an ""emotional"" outburst.  The Congress leadership, said his advisor Mohammad Mustafa, understands that Mr Sidhu ""acts emotionally at times"". ""The Congress leadership understands Navjot Sidhu and Sidhu is not beyond the Congress leadership. He is not Amarinder Singh, who never cared for the Congress and its leadership,"" he added. Mr Channi, the state's first Dalit Chief Minister whose selection is being hailed by many as a gamechanger for the Congress ahead of next year's state polls, had indicated that he was willing to consider suggestions. This morning, Mr Sidhu met him at the Punjab Bhavan.  Sources indicated that Mr Channi is ready to accommodate Mr Sidhu on at least one point -- he may drop Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota as Punjab police chief.  Mr Sidhu had objected to him over the investigation into the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib in 2015 - which was one of his biggest grouses against the Amarinder Singh government. Mr Sahota was the head of a Special Investigation Team to probe the incidents of sacrilege. Mr Sidhu, who joined the Congress ahead of the 2017 elections after a stint in the BJP, had hoped to be Amarinder Singh's deputy after the elections. But Mr Singh had vetoed it. After his resignation, Mr Sidhu's hope to step into his shoes was crushed as the party high command chose Mr Channi for the job.   Mr Sidhu was elevated to the post of the party chief after his year-long, bitter feud with Amarinder Singh -- then Chief Minister and the party's tallest leader in Punjab. His promotion came at the behest of Gandhis, who were seen as backing the cricketer-turned politician through the bitter face-off.  ""My fight is issue-based and I have stood by it for a long time.

Four years later, President Joe Biden is showing no such urgency -- and much more predictability -- even as the authoritarian state steps up both rocket launches and rhetoric. The Biden administration has repeatedly said it is willing to resume talks without preconditions but it also shows little interest in enticing North Korea, which wants an end to sweeping sanctions. North Korea for Biden is ""still a priority issue but also a no-win kind of scenario,"" said Jenny Town, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center. More proactive diplomacy would open Biden to accusations either that he is rewarding ""bad behavior"" or that he went too far or not far enough. ""If you're looking at how much political capital is the administration willing to spend on this issue, especially after Afghanistan, it's probably not very high,"" she said. North Korea said recent tests included a new hypersonic missile, whose speed would be a potential game-changer, and Kim called the US offer of talks a ""petty trick."" Trump had sought a wide-ranging agreement with North Korea, with which the United States remains technically still at war, but his three meetings failed to produce more than promises by Kim to hold off on nuclear and long-range missile testing. ""The last thing Kim Jong Un is going to want is another high-profile diplomatic failure at a time when they're having economic hardships and Covid-related hardship,"" Town said. Small steps? In an April policy review, the Biden administration said it was willing to engage North Korea and be flexible. The policy appeared to be different both from Trump's pageantry and, at least on paper, from Obama's concept of ""strategic patience,"" or waiting indefinitely until North Korea budges. Few North Korea watchers believe that Kim will accept US demands to give up the nuclear arsenal, seen as an ultimate guarantor of security. But Jacob Stokes, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the Biden administration could still negotiate an end to provocative behavior such as tests. The challenge ""is can you shelve the long-term question long enough to make interim progress,"" Stokes said. If North Korea wants to keep up ""aggressive provocations until the United States and South Korea provide a bunch of unilateral upfront concessions as the price of even getting to the negotiating table, that's very unlikely to work,"" he said. North Korea has nonetheless taken small steps to ease tensions with South Korea, including restoring a military hotline. The Biden administration has put a priority on allies South Korea and Japan and backed efforts by the South's dovish president, Moon Jae-In. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday he supported any South Korean efforts that can ""reduce the risks,"" even as the United States prepared to take North Korea before the UN Security Council. Looking for new ways Ken Gause, who directs the adversary analytics program at the CNA research organization, said North Korea appeared to be following a two-track approach of raising the stakes with the United States while hoping South Korea can push diplomacy forward. ""North Korea has a game plan -- to push the US off strategic patience and to get them to put sanctions relief on the table. That's why they reject unconditional talks,"" Gause said. He said that the previous administration -- ""completely for reasons that had to do with Trump's mindset"" -- found a more productive way to engage North Korea, but ultimately failed by focusing on pressure rather than incentives. He feared that the Biden administration, filled with veteran policymakers, will not ""think out of the box.""   ""For the last 40-50 years, we have framed this problem as a bilateral, black-and-white zero-sum game on the Korean peninsula -- you win, we lose, we win, you lose. That's where we are now.""

""We've been very honest about our concerns with Pakistan for a long time, about the safe havens that exist on their side of the border along that spine.

As Afghanistan's neighbour, Pakistan certainly has equities and responsibilities with respect to terrorism in that part of the world, Mr Kirby said.

The Taliban has accused the US of violating the withdrawal agreement by continuing to fly drones over Afghanistan and warned Americans against doing that in the future. ""We have the authorities that we need to continue to defend our interests and the security of the American people there and around the world, and we're going to do that,"" John Kirby said.   ""Over-the-horizon operations don't always have to include unmanned aerial assets, and they don't.

""The FTA trade round has been postponed for a month until November,"" an EU official in Canberra told AFP, throwing the future of the far-reaching pact into doubt. Australia last month abruptly cancelled a multibillion-dollar contract for 12 French submarines, opting to buy nuclear-powered US-designed vessels instead. The decision prompted a major diplomatic spat with one of the European Union's largest members and now appears to have hit ties with the entire bloc. France has publicly said it can no longer trust Australia's government, accusing officials of lying and questioning whether the trade agreement can go ahead. Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan, who was scheduled to travel to Europe for the talks, played down the decision in a statement to AFP. ""We understand the French reaction to our submarine decision but ultimately any nation must act in its national interest -- which is what Australia has done,"" he said. Tehan indicated he plans to meet EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis next week to discuss what would be the 12th round of negotiations. ""We will continue preparing for the 12th round of negotiations and working towards concluding a free trade agreement that is in the interests of both Australia and the EU.""

""The latest data shows modest gains but there is still a long way to go to reach the WHO target of fully vaccinating 40 percent of the population by the end of the year,"" said Richard Mihigo, the World Health Organization's vaccination coordinator in Africa.

A total of 23 million vaccine doses arrived in Africa in September, a 10-fold increase from June. Half of the 52 African countries that have received COVID-19 vaccines have fully vaccinated just 2 percent or less of their populations, the WHO said. Most of the African countries that have met, or bettered the 10 percent goal have relatively small populations. The islands of Mauritius and the Seychelles have managed to fully vaccinate over 60 percent of their populations, according to the WHO data. In Morocco 48 percent of the population have received two Covid-19 jabs while the figures are above 20 percent in Tunisia, Comoros and Cape Verde.

""This is the left government's stand which we have made clear from the beginning,"" he added. Mr Vijayan further said that in our country, citizenship was never decided based on religion. ""Belonging to one religion is not a criterion for citizenship here; people have a right to believe in any religion or live without believing in any religion,"" he said.

Pele, 80, had been receiving treatment at Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo since August 31, after a suspected tumor was detected during routine tests. Pele, who underwent surgery on September 4, is in ""stable"" condition, doctors said. The hospital did not use the word ""cancer"" in its statement and gave no further details on Pele's chemotherapy, but the treatment is typically used in cancer patients. The results of his biopsy were not made public. ""I am so happy to be back at home,"" Pele said in a statement on Facebook. ""I want to thank the entire Albert Einstein Hospital team, who made my stay a pleasant one, with a humane and very affectionate welcome. Thanks also to all of you, who from afar, make my life complete with so many messages of love."" ""When the road is hard, celebrate every step of the journey. Focus on your happiness. It's true that I can't jump anymore, but these past few days, I've been punching the air more often than usual,"" he wrote. Considered by many the greatest footballer of all time, Edson Arantes do Nascimento -- Pele's real name -- has been in poor health in recent years, and has had various stints in the hospital. The only player in history to win three World Cups (1958, 1962 and 1970), he burst onto the global stage at just 17 with dazzling goals, including two in the final against hosts Sweden, as Brazil won the World Cup for the first time in 1958.

Under plans announced by the government a year ago, most EU, EEA and Swiss citizens will need a valid passport to enter the UK as border officials stop accepting national identity cards as a travel document on October 1. The UK said the changes following its definitive departure from the EU earlier this year were necesary to prevent the use of the more easliy forged documents, combat crime and stop illegal migrants. In a statement late on Thursday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said Britain needed to ""clamp down on the criminals that seek to enter our country illegally using forged documents"". ""By ending the use of insecure ID cards we are strengthening our border and delivering on the people's priority to take back control of our immigration system,"" she added. The changes come as Britian grapples with a shortage of thousands of HGV drivers that has led to a profound fuel crisis and shortages on supermarket shelves. Haulage industry figures have warned the changes to IDs risk creating further obstacles to drivers amid the shortages already blamed by government critics on Brexit as well as the coronavirus. The ban on the IDs part of a package of changes to deliver on the ruling Conservative Party's 2019 election promise to take control of Britain's borders. The propsed laws, which have proved controversial with human rights campaigners, include powers to arrest illegal immigrants and transfer asylum-seekers overseas while their applications are processed.   The government has said EU, EEA and Swiss citizens who previously resided in the UK and have been granted the right to stay in Britain will still be able to use their national identity cards at borders until 2025.

Senators grilled the social media giant's Antigone Davis in an hours-long Capitol Hill hearing called over damning reports that Facebook's own research warned of the harm photo-sharing app Instagram can do to teenage girls' well-being. ""This research is a bombshell. It is powerful, gripping, riveting evidence that Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children, and that it has concealed those facts and findings,"" Senator Richard Blumenthal said. Davis, under questioning from Blumenthal and other senators, repeatedly said a Wall Street Journal series had selectively chosen parts of its studies to give an inaccurately dark vision of the company's work. She told lawmakers that a survey of teens on 12 serious issues like anxiety, sadness and eating disorders, showed that Instagram was generally helpful to them. ""On 11 of the 12 issues, teen girls who said they struggled with those issues were more likely to say that Instagram was affirmatively helping them, not making it worse,"" said Davis, who delivered her testimony remotely. Yet, Blumenthal read aloud excerpts from company documents he said were leaked to lawmakers by a Facebook whistleblower that directly contradicted her. - Facebook whistleblower - ""Substantial evidence suggests that experiences on Instagram and Facebook make body dissatisfaction worse,"" he said, adding the finding was not a disgruntled worker's complaint but company research. A Facebook whistleblower is set to testify before senators on Tuesday, but it was not immediately clear if that person was also the source of the leaked documents. The social media giant has faced a growing backlash, including Thursday's hearing, in the wake of the Journal reports, and it has halted work on a fiercely criticized plan to make a version of Instagram for children under 13. Facebook argued a specially designed platform would allow some parental control in an online world already full of children, but critics called it a cynical strategy to hook the youngest users. Lawmakers on Thursday demanded a pledge from Facebook to release all of its research and not to take aims at children under 13. ""Miss Davis will you commit that Facebook will not launch any platforms targeting kids 12 and under that include features... that allow children to quantify popularity?"" asked Senator Ed Markey. Davis sidestepped his query and instead said the company's products ""enrich"" lives by allowing teens to connect with friends and family. She added Facebook was looking into ways to share more of its findings, but that there were ""privacy considerations"" to take into account. On Wednesday, the company released a heavily annotated version of two presentations on its own research but it was unclear what percentage they represent of its internal studies. The company has been under relentless pressure to guard against being a platform where misinformation, hate and child-harming content can spread.   Legislators have struggled to pass new rules that would update online protections in decades-old laws crafted long before social media even existed.

The allegations, firmly rejected by Blue Origin, were outlined in a lengthy blogpost signed by Alexandra Abrams, the company's former head of employee communications. The post said it also represented the views of 20 other workers and ex-workers in various divisions who wanted to remain anonymous. ""Workforce gender gaps are common in the space industry, but at Blue Origin they also manifest in a particular brand of sexism,"" it said. One senior executive was said to have reported for sexual harassment multiple times, but remained within the ""loyal inner circle"" of CEO Bob Smith. Another former executive frequently referred to women co-workers as ""'baby girl,' 'baby doll,' or 'sweetheart'"" and inquired about their dating lives, the post added. ""It appeared to many of us that he was protected by his close personal relationship with Bezos -- it took him physically groping a female subordinate for him to finally be let go,"" the authors said. They also said a former NASA astronaut and Blue Origin senior leader once instructed a group of women: ""You should ask my opinion because I am a man."" Abrams and her co-authors further claimed that the company romanticized burnout, suppressed dissent, and was obsessed with competing with rivals SpaceX and Virgin Galactic in the race to launch their billionaire founders, thus compromising safety. ""In the opinion of an engineer who has signed on to this essay, 'Blue Origin has been lucky that nothing has happened so far,'"" they said. A Blue Origin spokesperson denied the allegations, saying Abrams was dismissed two years ago after warnings over issues involving US export control regulations. ""Blue Origin has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,"" the spokesperson added. ""We provide numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct."" The US Federal Aviation Administration told AFP that the regulatory agency ""takes every allegation seriously"" and is reviewing the information. Bezos spent a few minutes beyond Earth's atmosphere in July on Blue Origin's first crewed mission -- a breakthrough moment for the space tourism sector after years of delays. The 10-minute hop from a west Texas base to beyond the Karman line and back again minted four new astronauts, including the oldest and youngest ever.   Blue Origin announced plans this week for a second flight in October, and an unconfirmed report said it may include a celebrity astronaut: Bill Shatner, who played Captain Kirk on ""Star Trek.""

Meng, whose case had raised passions within the Chinese public, had been sought by Washington for allegedly violating unilateral US sanctions on Iran.

""There is a limited runway on that, and the runway is getting shorter."" Blinken reiterated that President Joe Biden was willing to return the United States to a 2015 accord in which Iran drastically scaled back nuclear work in return for promises of economic relief. Former president Donald Trump trashed the deal known formally as the JCPOA and reimposed sweeping sanctions, which Iran wants removed before it undoes a series of steps out of compliance that it took to protest the pressure campaign. ""Simply getting back to the terms of the JCPOA at some point will not be sufficient to recapture the benefits of the agreement because of the progress Iran has made,"" Blinken said. Blinken said that the Biden administration has been engaged ""in very good faith for many months"" in indirect talks in Vienna with Iran on returning to compliance. Iran requested a break in talks in June due to a political transition as the ultraconservative Ebrahim Raisi became president, replacing Hassan Rouhani who entered the nuclear deal and favored better relations with the West.

1056,Fri Oct 01 00:42:46 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: Ex-French President Nicolas Sarkozy Given Second Jail Term https://t.co/3nT7TzaznF https://t.co/Sn5dP4VWTg,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ex-french-president-nicolas-sarkozy-given-2nd-jail-term-but-he-wont-be-behind-bars-2559707,Ex-French President Nicolas Sarkozy Given 2nd Jail Term But He Won't Be Behind Bars,"A French court on Thursday handed former president Nicolas Sarkozy a one-year prison sentence for illegal financing of his 2012 re-election bid, dealing a fresh blow to the right-winger seven months after he received a jail term for corruption. Sarkozy, 66, will not serve time behind bars under the terms of Thursday's verdict, with the court ruling that he could serve it at home by wearing an electronic bracelet. He was not in court to hear the judge impose the maximum sentence for illegal campaign financing after finding that Sarkozy had ""voluntarily neglected to exercise oversight over the spending incurred"". Sarkozy immediately vowed a fight to the finish against what he said was an ""injustice"". ""I am simply asking that the law is applied to me as it is to any other"" person, he said, vowing to go ""right to the end"" to seek ""truth and justice"". Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog said his client would appeal against the conviction. Sarkozy spent nearly twice the legal limit of 22.5 million euros ($26 million) on his failed bid for a second term in office. The case is one of several arising from a string of investigations into Sarkozy's affairs, which have largely failed to dent his popularity among conservative voters. In March, he became France's first postwar president to be sentenced to jail relating to his attempts to secure favours from a judge in return for the promise of a plum retirement job. He has accused the judiciary, with which he crossed swords during his time as president between 2007 and 2012, of hounding him. ""I never betrayed the trust of the French people,"" he told the TF1 channel in March. - Fake invoices - Sarkozy pulled out all the stops in 2012 as he sought to fend off his Socialist rival Francois Hollande for a second term. A series of lavish US-style election rallies caused his costs to spiral, with the final bill coming to at least 42.8 million euros. The public relations firm Bygmalion, hired to organise the events, set up a system of fake invoices to mask the real cost of the events. While the investigation failed to prove Sarkozy was aware of the fraud, the court ruled that he had ""undeniably"" profited from it. At his five-week trial in May and June, the prosecution portrayed him as having a ""cavalier"" attitude to the public money available to candidates during campaigning. Sarkozy argued he had been too busy running the country to closely scrutinise the accounts. His Union for a Popular Movement party, since renamed the Republicans, picked up the tab for most of the excess. Thirteen other people, including Sarkozy's former campaign manager, several Bygmalion executives and a handful of former Republicans directors, were also tried in the case. They received jail terms of up to three and a half years in prison, with part of the sentences suspended. - Corruption case - The case failed to garner much interest among the public, seen as less sensational than his earlier corruption trial. Sarkozy received a three-year jail term for corruption and influence peddling in that case, two years of which were suspended. He has also appealed against that verdict. In that case too he will likely avoid prison even if he loses his appeal, with the judge saying she would consider letting him serve his sentence under electronic surveillance at home. Before Sarkozy, the only French leader to be convicted in a criminal trial was his predecessor Jacques Chirac, who received a two-year suspended sentence in 2011 for corruption over a fake jobs scandal relating to his time as Paris mayor. Sarkozy has also been charged over allegations that he received millions of euros for his 2007 election campaign from the late Libyan dictator Moamer Kadhafi. And in January, prosecutors opened a probe into alleged influence-peddling involving his activities as a consultant in Russia. He brushed aside his legal woes in 2016 and attempted to stage a political comeback. But he failed to win the Republicans nomination for president, losing to his former prime minister Francois Fillon, who campaigned as a cleaner pair of hands. Fillon was tipped to win the election but crashed out in the first round over revelations his wife was paid nearly a million euros for a suspected fake job as a parliamentary assistant.   Fillon and his wife were later convicted of fraud. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

Announcing the complete withdrawal of US troops in April, President Joe Biden vowed he would not allow a comeback of Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden hatched the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. Since then, the Pentagon has repeatedly claimed it is capable of keeping Al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) militants in Afghanistan in check through ""over-the-horizon"" strikes from US bases or aircraft carriers. ""Over-the-horizon operations are difficult but absolutely possible,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. ""And intelligence that supports them comes from a variety of sources, and not just US boots on the ground."" Austin's remarks came about two weeks after the Pentagon chief was forced to apologize to the relatives of civilians killed in an August 29 drone strike in Kabul. The target of the drone strike was suspected IS terrorists but it ended up killing 10 civilians, including seven children, in what Austin called a ""horrible mistake."" It was the latest in a long line of US drone strikes that caused civilian casualties in Afghanistan, becoming one of the most contentious issues over the 20-year war and prompting harsh criticism from Afghans. In his congressional testimony, Austin declined to publicly divulge much about the Pentagon's ""over-the-horizon"" plans, telling committee members he could provide more details in a closed classified session. - 'Good luck' - A number of experts and lawmakers expressed skepticism about the efficacy of long distance strikes on land-locked Afghanistan, which is thousands of miles (kilometers) from the nearest US base. ""Kill Terrorists in Afghanistan From 'Over The Horizon'? Good Luck,"" headlined an article by James Holmes, a professor of maritime strategy at the Naval War College. ""Over-the-horizon operations work well when the battlefield lies within easy reach of sea or air forces,"" Holmes said in the piece published on the national security website 19fortyfive.com. ""Land-based aircraft flying from Persian Gulf airstrips must detour southward around hostile Iranian airspace, into the Arabian Sea, and northward through Pakistani airspace to strike targets in Afghanistan,"" said Holmes, a former US Navy officer. ""Carrier aircraft have it easier from a distance standpoint since their mobile airfield can linger in the Arabian Sea,"" he added. ""But even so, the Afghan capital of Kabul lies close to 700 miles from the closest point along the Pakistani seacoast,"" Holmes said. ""Inflight refueling will be a must."" - 'A fiction' - Mike Waltz, a Republican lawmaker from Florida, accused Biden and Austin of peddling a ""fiction"" when it came to ""over-the-horizon"" capability. Unlike in Iraq, where US troops fought IS with Iraqi government forces, or Syria, where Americans partnered with Kurdish fighters, the United States does not have any allies on the ground in Afghanistan or any nearby bases, Waltz said. ""Those drones have to fly all the way around Iran, all the way up Pakistan and lose 70 to 80 percent of their fuel before they even get anywhere near a target,"" said Waltz, a former US Army Green Beret who served in Afghanistan. ""The president of the United States is selling this country a fiction that we can do over here with nothing,"" Waltz said, pointing to Afghanistan on a map, ""what we're doing over here (in Iraq and Syria) with neighboring bases access, with allies on the ground and with ocean access."" ""That is a fiction that you all need to own,"" he added. In the early 2000s, the United States had military bases in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, but it is no longer present in Central Asia, which Russia considers its sphere of influence. General Mark Milley, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told lawmakers that he met recently in Europe with his Russian counterpart, General Valery Gerasimov. ""In the main, we're not asking permission -- negotiating, I guess, is the word,"" Milley said. ""President (Vladimir) Putin and President Biden had a conversation and I was following up on that conversation,"" he said. Andy Kim, a Democratic lawmaker from New Jersey, asked Austin, the Pentagon chief, whether US overflights of Afghanistan were legal. ""Yes,"" Austin replied, adding that he would provide further details in a classified setting.   The Taliban this week accused the United States of violating international law with drone flights over Afghan territory and warned of ""negative consequences"" if they continued.

The Legacy Museum in the state capital of Montgomery is housed in a building where African captives were once held before being sold as slaves. ""It's a museum about the history of America, with a focus on the legacy of slavery,"" Bryan Stevenson, the head of Equal Justice Initiative, a civil rights organization in Alabama, told AFP. ""I can't think of another institution in America that has more profoundly shaped our economy, our politics, our social structures. And our character."" ""Our understanding of slavery is very very incomplete,"" he said. It is this information void that the Legacy Museum aims to fill, while prompting Americans to campaign against the inequality that persists today, according to Stevenson. ""The only way we can make progress in this country is if we engage both our minds and our hearts in a serious commitment to truth and justice to eliminating racial injustice,"" he said. The museum, inspired by memorials to the Holocaust in Berlin or to apartheid in Johannesburg, offers an immersive experience: upon arrival, visitors board a ship crossing the Atlantic, witnessing the suffering of future slaves. Another space is dedicated to the violence experienced by slaves, including sexual violence. One wing is dedicated to the thousands of victims of lynchings of Black Americans, which occurred between 1877 and 1950. The National Lynching Memorial, located next to the museum, is devoted to the same topic. The museum also conveys the ""humiliation of segregation"" in the South after World War II, Stevenson said. Stevenson's organization provides legal assistance and advocacy for people wrongly convicted of crimes, a widespread problem for African Americans. The group has succeeded in acquitting several people who had been condemned to death. In the museum, visitors can listen to them tell their stories. The museum is part of a national reckoning on race and racism in America, which has grown more intense since the murder of African American George Floyd by a white police officer in May 2020. Stevenson lamented that the efforts are meeting resistance on the part of conservatives. Still, he was optimistic.   ""The good news is that we have the capacity to get past that fear, to get past that preference for silence,"" Stevenson said. ""I believe we will make that choice.""

He will be produced before a court for recording his statement under Section 164 of the CrPC, the police said. The matter came to light when Tej Pal Singh, a resident of Bijnor in UP, informed police that his son Sushant Chawdhary was missing. On September 24, the complainant with his younger son had gone to Sushant's office and he came to know that his son had not come to office since September 8, they said. Mr Singh received a text message from Sushant's phone saying that he had taken a loan of ₹ 1,50,000 and had returned ₹ 75,000. The message said if the remaining amount was not returned, then Sushant would be in big trouble, the police said. The police raided Gandhi Maidan, Chandni Chowk and other areas and traced Sushant. During interrogation, Sushant revealed that he had staged his own kidnapping as he needed some funds to repay his loans. Sushant told the police that he had been regularly investing money in an online trading site. He had taken loans to invest in this site but suffered huge losses, the police said.   He hatched a plan to demand money from his parents and staged his own kidnapping, the police said.

Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, and a member of G-23, said any suggestion from any quarter should be welcomed instead of being suppressed. ""I strongly condemn the orchestrated hooliganism @KapilSibal's residence last night. He is a loyal congressman fighting for the party both inside and outside the Parliament.

""I feel helpless when we cannot start meaningful conversations within party forums. I also feel hurt and helpless when I see pictures of Congress workers raising slogans outside the residence of a colleague and MP. The safe harbour to which one can withdraw seems to be silence,"" he said in a tweet. Party leader Anand Sharma has also condemned hooliganism outside Mr Sibal's residence. ""Shocked and disgusted to hear the news of attack and hooliganism at Kapil Sibal's house. This deplorable action brings disrepute to the party and needs to be strongly condemned.""

Normally, Delhi records 653.6 mm of rainfall during the monsoon season. The rainfall this season was 80 per cent above normal. Last year, the capital gauged 576.5 mm of precipitation. Three districts -- Central Delhi, New Delhi and North Delhi -- recorded ""large excess"" rainfall. Northwest Delhi and Southwest gauged ""excess"" rainfall. While west, south and east Delhi got ""normal"" precipitation, only northeast Delhi recorded ""deficient"" rainfall. According to the IMD, the Safdarjung Observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, received 1,169.7 mm of rainfall this season. It had gauged 1,155.6 mm of rainfall in 1975 and 1,190.9 mm in 1964. The all-time record is 1,420.3 mm rainfall in 1933. This was the third time in the last two decades that the monsoon rainfall in Delhi breached the 1,000 mm mark. The city had recorded 1,031.5 mm of rainfall in the monsoon season in 2010. In 2003, the capital had gauged 1,050 mm rainfall. Delhi received 636 mm, 544 mm, 876 mm, 370.8 mm and 505.5 mm rainfall during the monsoon season in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. It recorded 524.7 mm of rainfall in 2016, 641.3 mm in 2017, 762.6 mm in 2018, 404.3 mm in 2019, and 576.5 mm in 2020, according to the IMD data. September, in particular, was bountiful this season. The capital gauged 413.3mm of rainfall in the month, the highest after 417.3 mm precipitation recorded in September 1944 and the second-highest in 121 years. The September rainfall this year has been in marked contrast to last year, when the city got a meagre 20.9 mm precipitation in the month against a normal of 129.8 mm. Despite the monsoon arriving in Delhi only on July 13, making it the most-delayed in 19 years, the capital recorded 16 rainy days in the month, the maximum in the last four years. The string of rainy days brought 507.1 mm rainfall to the city, which was nearly 141 per cent above the long-period average of 210.6 mm. It was also the maximum rainfall in the month since July 2003, and the second highest ever. The city recorded just 10 rainy days in August, the lowest in seven years, and a cumulative rainfall of 214.5 mm, lower than the average of 247 mm. Delhi has also witnessed seven heavy rain events (64.5 mm to 115.5mm) this monsoon season so far, the highest ever, and these spells account for around 60 per cent of the rainfall recorded in the city. Six heavy rain days were recorded in the 1964 monsoon season. Experts say the increase in the number of heavy rain events in many parts of the country is directly linked to climate change. Normally, Delhi records just one or two such events during the entire season, said senior IMD scientist R K Jenamani. The capital recorded three spells of heavy rain in July -- 69.6 mm on July 19, 100 mm on July 27, and 72 mm on July 30. While one heavy such episode occurred last month -- 138.8 mm of rainfall on August 21 -- Delhi has already witnessed three such events this month -- 112.1mm on September 1, 117.7 mm on September 2, and 94.7 mm September 11.

He also mentioned the ""big challenges"" facing the Army in avoiding technological obsolescence and said that ""the danger that our long-drawn procurement processes and bureaucratic speed-breakers would prevent us from acquiring cutting edge technology is a real one"". In an address at the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Gen Naravane, referring to the L1 concept, wondered why price should dictate the choices of the armed forces when the money is destined to be pumped back into the domestic economy as the focus has been on procuring indigenously-developed military hardware. ""In the defence sector, there is a thrust towards ease of doing business. The industry too needs to proactively push for reforms. Processes that are out of sync with contemporary times and our future vision must be ruthlessly shed for modern best practices,"" he said. ""The L1 system is one such legacy of the colonial era that has lost its relevance in a system that is pushing for indigenisation. After all, why should merely price dictate our choice, when the money is destined to be pumped back into the domestic economy,"" he said. Gen Naravane said that much work has been done in bringing about systemic changes but archaic rules and processes still exist, defying logic and are at variance to modern best practices. ""With the cycle of new and disruptive technologies getting shorter and faster, avoiding technological obsolescence remains a big challenge. The danger that our long drawn procurement processes and bureaucratic speed-breakers would prevent us from acquiring cutting edge technology is a real one,"" he said. ""Much work has been done in bringing about systemic changes with the aim of ease of doing business. This however remains a work in progress. There are still archaic rules and processes that defy logic and are at variance to modern best practices. This needs to be addressed,"" he added. The Chief of Army Staff cited the example of Israel to emphasise how even small countries with huge challenges and limited resources have been able to achieve so much by riding on a vibrant and responsive defence ecosystem. ""Israel is an apt example. As contracts are signed with local businesses, the investment in Defence is ploughed back into the economy,"" he said. Gen Naravane said technology is driving the ""revolution in war-fighting"" and that the Indian MSMEs need to reinvent and engage themselves in the niche domains and build capabilities to offer innovative solutions. The Army Chief said the national security is not the preserve of the armed forces alone and it is a ""whole of government effort"". ""Equally true it is that wars are fought by nations and not by only by the armies. The government has taken a number of initiatives to create a conducive environment and a supportive ecosystem to encourage the defence industry to grow and expand,"" he said. He also mentioned the ""extremely positive results"" of the government granting emergency powers to the armed forces for critical procurement. The emergency powers were granted in June last year till March and it was subsequently extended till August. Gen Naravane said 113 contracts for revenue procurement of operationally critical ammunition, armament, vehicles, spares and special mountaineering equipment for almost ₹ 9000 crore were concluded while another lot of 68 contracts for capital procurement were sealed for about ₹ 6,500 crore. ""During the conclusion of these contracts, savings of about ₹ 1700 crore was accrued to the state due to the diligence and financial prudence of the Emergency Empowered Committee at the service headquarters level,"" he said. ""The contracts were signed within a year with another year for the deliveries to commence. The system has been a win-win combination for the industry and the user,"" he added.   Gen Naravane asserted that the Indian Army is fully committed to promoting the Indian defence industry and that contracts worth over ₹ 16,000 crore were placed on it in recent months .

Many artists have buried 15 paintings depicting women in their modern artwork in a compound days after the outfit entered the capital city Kabul, according to the media international media outlet. Citing various similar examples, The Washington Post reported that a well-known filmmaker has tucked away a large hard drive with more than 20 films in a secret location before she fled the war-ravaged country. While a bookseller in his sidewalk shop concealed every book the Taliban consider damning which include two Bibles, translated into Dari and Pashto. ""If the Taliban fighters find this, they will punish me,"" the bookseller said, reported The Washington Post. During the past 20 years of Western presence ushered in a flowering of arts, film, music and books, helping to transform Kabul into a cosmopolitan metropolis. A new generation of artists was influenced as much by Afghan traditions and history as by modern themes such as the war, Western music, women's rights and oppression under the Taliban. ""The kind of art that we believe has a value means artists should be free to express their own thoughts, not under dictatorship or censorship,"" said Sahraa Karimi, the filmmaker. ""Those artists will not easily be able to work as freely as they used to. And they were so free."" Even as some artists take great risks to protect their creations, many have fled the country, while others are self-censoring to avoid the wrath of the Taliban, the international media outlet said. Various artists have destroyed their paintings or sculptures. Stores selling musical instruments have shuttered, as have many art galleries. Wedding bands and singers have stopped working as many wedding halls cancel live music to not anger the Taliban. Afghan filmmaking, at the moment, is dead. ""The Taliban has not issued any statements regarding the arts,"" said Safiullah Habibi, the director of Kabul's Fine Arts Institute, a government facility. ""But artists themselves are limiting themselves. They think the Taliban will repeat what happened in the 1990s. At that time, the arts had no place in their rule."" Bilal Karimi, the Taliban deputy spokesperson, said the interim government is new and is still ""making a framework"" for all issues concerning arts and culture. But he said that whether a form of art is ""permissible or prohibited"" will be governed by Islamic law, or Sharia. Earlier this week, the Taliban's Ministry of Justice said that the Constitution from King Zahir Shah's era will be enforced for an interim period. However TOLO News sources said that the decision is not final yet.   Older generations remember the ultraconservative Islamic regime that saw regular stoning, amputations and public executions during Taliban rule before the US-led invasion that followed the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) urged citizens to scrupulously follow COVID-19 protocols and keep celebrations low-key in view of the pandemic as it issued guidelines and standard operating procedure (SOP) for the nine-day-long Navratri festival which begins on October 7. For the second straight year, the popular festival will be celebrated under the long shadow of the pandemic. An official said the BMC has urged people to celebrate the festival in a low-key manner and asked 'sarvajanik' (public) mandals to take permission from the civic body via the online mode for installing Goddess Durga idols in pandals (marquees). Heights of idols should be four feet for mandals and two feet for household ones, the civic official said. He said no 'garba' events will be allowed during the festival. Garba is a popular folk dance of Gujarat which is performed by devotees during the Navratri festival. Mandals should arrange online darshan of idols to avoid crowding and use Facebook and other social media platforms to reach out to devotees, he said. At the time of 'aarti' (a ritual of worship), not more than 10 people should be present at the venue and they should follow coronavirus guidelines like wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing, the official said. Immersion of household idols should be done at homes by devotees if it is not possible for them to go to the nearest immersion point set up by the civic body, he said. Only five people can take part in immersion of household idols and 10 devotees in those installed by community groups. In both cases, people taking part in immersion should be fully vaccinated against coronavirus, the official said. People will not be allowed to submerge idols, which will have to be handed over to BMC officials at immersion points, he said. Devotees should follow noise pollution rules as well as police guidelines during celebration of the festival to avoid to face any action, the official said. If any community mandal installing idols falls under COVID-19 containment zone, it will have to immerse them in iron water tank in their premises, he said.   If during the festival, any building or 'chawl' (old row tenement) is sealed due to detection of coronavirus cases, their residents should immerse idols in buckets or water drums in their houses, the official added.

The depression is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm away from the Gujarat coast, as per the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) report. Moderate rains were recorded in the coastal districts of Saurashtra and Kutch during the day. “The depression over northeast Arabian Sea off Gujarat coast moved west-northwestwards with a speed of about 15 km per hour in the last six hours and lay centered at 190 km west northwest of Devbhoomi Dwarka coast of Gujarat, 200 km south southeast of Karachi of Pakistan and 730 km east southeast of Chabahar port of Iran,” the latest bulletin of the IMD said. “It is very likely to move west-northwestwards and intensify into a deep depression over northeast Arabian Sea off north Gujarat coast during the next 12 hours,"" the weather department said. It is then very likely to move further west-northwestwards and intensify into a cyclonic storm during the subsequent 12 hours, the IMD said. ""Thereafter, it is likely to continue to move towards Pakistan-Makran coasts,"" it added. IMD had earlier warned of heavy rainfall for the next two days in the coastal districts of Jamnagar, Porbandar, Dwarka and Kutch, and asked fishermen not to venture into the sea. Districts of Dwarka and Kutch received moderate rains along with Surendranagar and Botad districts of Saurashtra between 6 am to 8 pm, the State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC) said. Kalyanpur taluka in Dwarka district received 113 mm of rainfall during this period while Khambhalia in the same district received 56 mm of rainfall, it said. Lakhpat and Mandvi talukas in Kutch district received 47 mm of rainfall each, while Chotila and Thangadh talukas of Surendranagar received 56 and 52 mm of rain, the SEOC said in its release.

The court in the northern town of Itzehoe had issued an arrest warrant for Irmgard Furchner, one of the first women to be prosecuted for Nazi-era crimes in decades, after she failed to show up at the trial. Furchner had left her retirement home near Hamburg and taken a taxi to a subway station, said Frederike Milhoffer, a spokeswoman for the court, but she was not present when the proceedings were due to begin. The suspect, who is charged with complicity in the murders of more than 10,000 people at the Stutthof concentration camp in occupied Poland, had written a letter to the court to say that she would not be attending, Milhoffer said. Just hours later, the fugitive was found and the court will now decide whether to remand her in custody, said the spokeswoman. Amid the chaos, judge Dominik Gross said the hearing has been suspended until October 19. Christoph Heubner, vice president of the International Auschwitz Committee, said the escape attempt showed ""contempt for the survivors and also for the rule of law"". It also highlighted potential shortcomings in the justice system, he said. ""Even if the woman is very old, could not precautions have been taken (to prevent her from fleeing)? Where did she go? Who helped her?"" he told AFP. For Efraim Zuroff, an American-Israeli ""Nazi hunter"" who has played a key role in bringing former Nazi war criminals to trial, the conclusion that can be drawn was clear. ""Healthy enough to flee, healthy enough to go to jail!,"" he tweeted on Thursday. Fit to stand trial The planned opening of Furchner's trial came one day before the 75th anniversary of the sentencing of 12 senior members of the Nazi establishment to death by hanging at the first Nuremberg trial. It also comes a week before separate proceedings in Neuruppin, near Berlin, against a 100-year-old former camp guard. Prosecutors accuse Furchner of having assisted in the systematic murder of detainees at Stutthof, where she worked in the office of the camp commander, Paul Werner Hoppe, between June 1943 and April 1945. The trial is taking place in a youth court as she was aged between 18 and 19 at the time. Around 65,000 people died at the camp, not far from the city of Gdansk, among them ""Jewish prisoners, Polish partisans and Soviet Russian prisoners of war"", according to the indictment. Little time left Seventy-six years after the end of World War II, time is running out to bring people to justice for their role in the Nazi system. Prosecutors are currently investigating another eight cases, according to the Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes. In recent years, several cases have been abandoned as the accused died or were physically unable to stand trial. The last guilty verdict was issued to former SS guard Bruno Dey, who was handed a two-year suspended sentence in July at the age of 93. Furchner is the only woman to stand trial in recent years for crimes dating to the Nazi era, as the role of women in the Third Reich has long been overlooked. But since John Demjanjuk, a guard at a concentration camp, was convicted for serving as part of the Nazi killing machine in 2011, prosecutors have broadened the scope of their investigations beyond those directly responsible for atrocities. Execution orders According to Christoph Rueckel, a lawyer representing Holocaust survivors, Furchner ""handled all the correspondence"" for camp commander Hoppe. ""She typed out the deportation and execution commands"" at his dictation and initialled each message herself, Rueckel told public broadcaster NDR. However, Furchner's lawyer told the German weekly Spiegel ahead of the trial that it was possible the secretary had been ""screened off"" from what was going on at Stutthof. At least three other women have been investigated for their roles in Nazi camps, including another secretary at Stutthof, who died last year before charges could be brought. The prosecutor's office in Neuruppin is currently looking into the case of a woman employed at the Ravensbrueck camp, according to officials at the Central Office in Ludwigsburg. Among the women to be held to account for their actions during the Nazi era was Maria Mandl, a guard at the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, who was hanged in 1948 after being sentenced to death in Krakow, Poland. Between 1946 and 1948, in Hamburg, 21 women went on trial before a British military tribunal for their role at the Ravensbrueck concentration camp for women.

That's up from $3.8 billion at the end of December, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings from family investment company WIT LLC, an acronym for the Walton Investment Team which began disclosing its holdings this year. Most of the money was invested in low-cost exchange-traded funds such as the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets and Short-Term Treasury ETFs, but the family also disclosed stakes in companies including Apollo Global Management Inc., Snowflake Inc. and China's Pinduoduo Inc. The Waltons are the world's wealthiest family, worth $238 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. About half that fortune is tied to the world's largest retailer, the company founded by Sam Walton in 1950. For years, the family kept its investments quiet, but that's proving harder to do as they rake in billions by selling stock in Walmart. The family has sold about $6.5 billion in Walmart stock since the start of 2020. Stakes Revealed Their stake in the business is still extraordinarily large for a public company, but a spate of stock buybacks in recent years by the Bentonville, Arkansas, retailer has prompted them to sell shares to keep their ownership percentage stable. That in turn has flooded the family office and the Walton Family Foundation with cash and required ever more sophisticated investing machinery. Members of the family have also increasingly shown more willingness to share information about their investments and philanthropic pursuits. Ben Walton owns Zoma Capital, which makes investments in areas such as energy and water. A representative for Walton Enterprises the Waltons' primary family office confirmed that WIT is an affiliate that invests on behalf of the family. Dele Butler, senior counsel of investments at Walton Enterprises, is listed on the filings as WIT's primary contact. According to her LinkedIn profile she ""advises and supports the family's growing investment and transaction activity."" Others at the company include Rupal Poltack, president, who joined in 2019 from Fidelity Investments. WIT's disclosures have gone largely unnoticed until now. The company started up in early 2020, state records show, several months before the Walton's family office transferred $48 billion to a separate trust established to divest the clan's shares in the retail giant. Walton Enterprises doesn't disclose its total assets, though tax records of private trusts showed that the family has held stakes in hedge funds run by Tiger Global Management and Viking Global Investors. Walmart Wealth   SEC rules require investors managing more than $100 million in U.S. equities to disclose their holdings, though family offices can appeal to keep these documents confidential. Walton Enterprises has never filed a so-called 13F quarterly report under that name. Other high-profile family offices, including one for Renaissance Technologies' founder James Simons, have started filing reports. Family office disclosures have become a flashpoint in Washington following the collapse of Archegos Capital Management, a personal investment vehicle for Bill Hwang that controlled billions of dollars in stocks that were never reported through quarterly filings."

Remarks by India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, came at a dinner event hosted by Indiaspora on Wednesday. ""We just had a very successful visit here,"" Mr Sandhu said. The dinner was attended by the who's who of the Indian-American community. Eminent members of the Indian-American community had gathered for the first time in Washington after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the US. During the visit, there was an important bilateral meeting between President Biden and Prime Minister Modi, the first one since the Biden-Harris administration was inaugurated in January this year. The two leaders had earlier met in 2014 and 2016 when Joe Biden was the vice president of the country. ""So, it was not the first time they were meeting, but the bilateral meeting was very good,"" Mr Sandhu said in his first public appearance after last week's visit of prime minister Modi. The interaction with US Vice-President Kamala Harris went very well, he said. The Quad summit hosted by Biden at the White House and attended by Modi along with their counterparts from Japan and Australia ""really went off very well,"" he said. ""There was a good candid and substantial exchange between all the four leaders,"" he said, adding that there are practical areas in which the corporation is moving quite ahead. ""In fact, in vaccines, all the four countries are bringing their respective strengths together and we are on our way to producing one billion vaccines in 2022 which will be distributed over the Indo-Pacific particularly in Southeast Asia,"" Mr Sandhu said. During his stay in Washington DC, Prime Minister Modi had two other bilaterals with Prime Minister Scott Morrison from Australia and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan. During his trips, the US handed over 150 historic antiquities to India, which the prime minister took with him on his return to India. From Washington DC, the Prime Minister went to New York where he addressed the UN General Assembly. Quickly running through some of the important areas during the trip in addition to the strategic ones, Sandhu said the prime minister had a good exchange on regional issues as well as other international challenges. ""Quad is a group of like-minded countries which are coming together because today's challenges are much international in nature. For example, COVID,"" he said. The US, India, Australia and Japan had in 2017 given shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the ""Quad"" or the Quadrilateral coalition to counter China's aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region. In affordable health care, he said, India is an important partner. ""There is tremendous scope for us, bilaterally to help each other and also to third countries,"" he said. As India resumes its export of vaccines, he noted there would be close cooperation with the United States and other like-minded countries   Digital, IT, startups and innovation holds a lot of promise in the bilateral relationship with the US. Climate change, environment and knowledge and education are other major areas of cooperation between the two countries.

In many ways, the political and physical conditions of the Gaza Strip are unique: Nearly 2 million people are packed into a 25-mile-long rectangle of land along the Mediterranean roughly the size of Philadelphia. For decades, the territory has been home to Palestinians displaced by the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, and subject to Israeli occupation since the 1967 Six-Day War. But since 2007, after the political wing of the Islamist group Hamas was elected to power, Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade. In response, Hamas militants have attacked Israel with suicide bombers and missile attacks, and the two sides have settled into a gruesome rhythm of low levels of violence punctuated by intense conflagrations. In May's fighting, as many as 260 Palestinians were killed; in Israel, 12 people were killed. 
Gaza is a landscape of extreme economic deprivation born of the region's complicated political dynamics - but one whose contours may soon become more common.  That's the premise behind the recently released book Open Gaza: Architectures of Hope, published by imprint . Edited by , an urban geographer who focuses on the Middle East, and essayist, theorist, activist, and provocateur Michael Sorkin, the book presents a vision of Gaza as a glimpse of an imminent future, where violence, surveillance, resource scarcity and provisional use of an extremely compromised built environment are visited on all.  Sharp sees connections, for example, between the unrest in Gaza and the racial justice demonstrations in U.S. cities after the murder of George Floyd in 2020: In both, the key issue is who has a right to the city - the right to claim contested urban space. ""The Black Lives Matter protests and that broader movement and recognition of the types of oppression that are going on [in Gaza] is something that's been made visible,"" he says.  The Gaza Strip, the book's promotional copy declares, is ""one of the most beleaguered environments on earth."" But the territory and its urban center, Gaza City, is appallingly understudied in terms of architecture and urbanism. That makes it a fitting swan song for Sorkin, who died last year of Covid-19. ""Michael wanted to go where others wouldn't dare,"" says Sharp. Featuring contributions from scholars, urbanists and architects from the occupied Palestinian territories, Israel, India, the U.S. and the U.K., the book's essays explore the extant condition of Gaza and its wider socio-political context, and offer speculative designs aimed at wresting back sovereignty and dignity for its residents. It posits that the ad-hoc, low-carbon design techniques that Gazans have developed look ahead to a planet failing to meet the challenges of a climate cataclysm, a global pandemic, and growing inequality. As brittle regimes are wracked by crises, mass migrations harden borders, and infrastructure buckles, Open Gaza suggest that the rest of the world may start to look more and more like Gaza. Or has already. Anyone who's searched for clean water in Flint or has seen their home destroyed in wildfires or floods might understand what who contributed to the book, means when she says, ""The Palestinianization of cities is happening worldwide. It's happening by destruction and erasure, but also with dramatic climate change.""  Eco-Adaptation by Necessity Open Gaza isn't content to just praise the ingenuity and resourcefulness of Gazan and allied urbanists and architects; nor is the book interested in depicting Gaza purely as a dystopian prison. ""You could call [these visions] utopian, but I think these are alternative possibilities,"" says Sharp. ""They're not fantasies."" Instead, the collection serves as a ""demand that [Gazans] be able to live and shape their urban context and infrastructure, and social lives in ways that are dignified and respectful of their humanity,"" he says. The book presents Gaza's architectural condition - extant and speculative - as defined by its power imbalance with Israel. This asymmetry means Open Gaza is free of the antiseptic techno-solutionism that often populates architecture tomes. Such documents often claim that low-carbon buildings, made from nothing more than the trees and dirt on their plot of earth, will exist in an atmosphere of happy consumers sipping lattes poured by robots, munching on locally sourced avocado BLTs. Open Gaza tells us this scenario might be a fairy tale. The book's prescriptions operate with found conditions and severe local constraints on materials; it suggests that your first shower warmed by solar power might happen in between air-raid sirens. This reality is why buzzwords like ""sustainability"" or ""resilience"" don't mean anything to the average Gazan, says Palestinian architect Salem Al Qudwa, who writes about the territory's quotidian, everyday buildings. , recycling brick may be a way to save carbon and bestow new buildings with the patina of age. But in Gaza, there is no choice.  Al Qudwa has developed ""incremental housing"" templates, he says, that begin by setting foundations and structural columns, and letting Gazans fill in the gaps, creating a low-cost lattice for expandable housing units that feature shaded courtyards and roof decks. Homes often lack electricity, so cross-breezes are essential. Made from local materials, they offer climate-attunement Al Qudwa says non-local NGOs intent on building often miss. ""My people need decent shelter,"" he says. ""A good house with proper insulation, with natural light, etc."" There is no nostalgia for vernacular buildings or ways of living, says Sharif, but these practices are critical. ""Gaza is looking at environmental practices out of necessity,"" she says. ""The only way forward is [through] traditional ways of living because there is no alternative."" Rafi Segal and Chris Mackey's ""Solar Dome"" - whose name riffs on  - makes the convincing case that there are few places better suited to an entirely solar grid. Gazans uses less than 2% of the average American's energy footprint, and Gaza's sunny climate further reduces the need for expensive energy storage. And the concept of ""energy independence"" takes on new meaning when citizens acquire utilities from . As such, Segal and Mackey recommend a system of building-scaled photovoltaic panels augmented with solar water heaters, and a district-scaled system of concentrated solar power towers. Similarly, a chapter by Denise Hoffman Brandt unveils a plan for pavilions that collect fresh rainwater and use sunlight to desalinate groundwater, and floating ocean desalination pods made from trash. Sharif's ""Learning Room"" plan, detailed in her chapter of Open Gaza written with Nasser Golzari, addresses the imposed mutability of Gaza's built environment. A system of modular, mobile shelters made from , rammed earth, wire mesh, bamboo, and more, it's a migrating community center for exchanging skills, made from rubble itself. ""The idea of the was not to see it as a permanent structure that is going to shape the identity of the city,"" says Sharif. ""It was an experimental space [you] can keep modifying and changing. It's not a new urban structure. It's more of a lab to allow new structures to happen."" In this way, the Learning Room underscores the difficulty of long-term planning in Gaza. It also distills the tactical flexibility Gazans must demonstrate to keep themselves housed. Western architects have made it a polemic to use only materials close at hand - to design their buildings as a bird builds a nest. Architect Jeanne Gang , but it's unlikely Gazans need such a reminder.  The most visceral and imaginative collision of low-carbon aspiration with apocalyptic utility arrives in Helga Tawil-Souri's chapter on the IPN: ""The Internet Pigeon Network."" To surmount Israeli restrictions on electricity and bandwidth, the NYU media scholar proposes a decentralized network of pigeon roosts, trainers, and pick-up nodes. This avian internet would fly pigeons with flash disks tied to their necks from point to point, offering a faster and more secure way to share information. Reliant on local knowledge and labor, it's another way of Gaza asserting infrastructural independence. A Different Kind of Smart City But it's not as though the built environment of Gaza is untouched by technology. In some ways, the digital network that monitors the city and its residents represents a variation on the data-intensive ""smart city"" concept - another way Gaza looks ahead to the future. Since 2014, Gaza's reconstruction has been managed through an online database called the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism (GRM). , the GRM records all the building material that flows in through its border, along with what it's to be used for and who will receive it. The mechanism, designed to ensure that resources aren't being used for military purposes by Hamas, was agreed upon by Israel and Palestine, and was meant to be temporary. But Franceco Sebregondi of  says it puts Israel in an ""ultimate supervisory role"": His chapter in Open Gaza, called ""Frontier Urbanization,"" details how the GRM gives Israeli authorities a granular picture of Gaza's built condition, and the ability to delay Gaza's rebuilding. Such omniscience is increasingly a goal of the design and building industry, where there's a push to translate plans into data and ensure that what's built closely aligns with digital models, to more efficiently manage construction and operational performance. But that's not the only way it could be used. How much of this information, for example, might a refugee resettlement nonprofit at the U.S.-Mexico border want to share with immigration authorities? While the GRM is relatively primitive, its broad usage across Gaza still creates a map of its reconstruction that exists nowhere else. For , who earned a Ph.D. on the architecture of the Gaza blockade from Goldsmiths, University of London, this intrusion reveals that the problem of the smart city is not technical. It's political. As with sunny visions of our eco-friendly future, design and urbanism themselves have no inherent autonomy to resist political agendas, and their calls for ease, efficiency, and low-impact living make ready Trojan Horses for power. ""Who will be in charge of accessing certain data?,"" says Sebregondi. ""What levels of transparency and access [are] granted by using this infrastructure? I don't think that the technologies behind smart urbanism cannot be re-engineered toward serving another idea of collective urban environments. But the ones that are currently marketed and very light-heartedly deployed across our cities tend to pursue the opposite."" This, he says, is a ""dark horizon we need to avoid and fight against."" The complex intimacy of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has turned the region into something of a proving ground for purpose-built surveillance technology that could be plugged into a future smart city. Indeed, Israeli companies are selling cybersecurity technology all over the world, including the U.S., where it's used in a new training center . Sebregondi sees Gaza as further along a continuum of ricocheting colonial violence: As states become more fragile and defensive and climate change adds layers of stress, inequalities skyrocket and people divide into camps. Where these two groups are anywhere near each other, the market for surveillance and control technology booms. Debates over the on the streets of U.S. cities and the rise of privacy-eroding public safety technology have collapsed the distance between Palestine and Pittsburgh. ""There is an extent to which Palestine becomes a sort of crystal [ball] of this particular future, within a very compacted and dense territory, [featuring] some of the most striking aspects of this splintering urbanism,"" says Sebregondi. He describes the ""boomerang effect of colonization,"" where techniques to wield control over restive populations in distant countries eventually come home, as with the NSA's experiments using the .  It's a cycle that's eradicated distance, says Sharp, pulling Gazans and the rest of the world closer together, and bringing the front lines, already at their doorstep, into ours.   ""These circulations of violence and containment,"" he says, ""come back to haunt us all."" (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"
1075,Thu Sep 30 21:30:00 +0000 2021,"A Facebook-Funded Flight Was Suddenly Packed With 155 Extra Afghans

https://t.co/OfoAemEQTW https://t.co/fkUyCFdL8v",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/revealed-how-155-extra-afghans-made-it-into-a-facebook-funded-airlift-2558576,A Facebook-Funded Flight Was Suddenly Packed With 155 Extra Afghans,"The airlift was fraught with risk from the start. Donors from Silicon Valley including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, as well as Facebook Inc., had agreed to fund an evacuation flight for 188 journalists, aid workers and others who were suddenly in danger after the Taliban's quick capture of Kabul. They hoped to get most of those evacuees to Mexico City, via Abu Dhabi, to start a new life. Those plans largely succeeded. But amid the chaos in Afghanistan, they also took an unexpected turn. Shortly before their flight left on August 30, the airline -- Kam Air -- stuffed the half-empty plane with at least 155 additional passengers -- its employees, their families and more, according to US officials and organisers of the flight. The 11th-hour surprise created agita at the State Department and in the United Arab Emirates because the extra passengers -- who weren't on the plane's manifest -- hadn't been screened for that flight and raised security and immigration concerns. It also created angst among many of the organisers and financial supporters, who say they had carefully vetted the original list of passengers and weren't aware of the extra passengers until the plane landed in Abu Dhabi. ""The 155, not on the FB manifest, were placed on the FB airplane by KAM airlines,"" according to a State Department email obtained by Bloomberg News. ""FB (and everyone else) learned about these individuals when they landed in Abu Dhabi."" The circumstances surrounding their departure underscored the turmoil that followed the US withdrawal from the longest foreign war in American history and the difficulty of controlling events in a war-torn country from halfway around the world. But it also exemplified the ways strange bedfellows -- in this case, Facebook Inc., a prominent tech founder, security firms, consultants and aid agencies -- came together to spirit endangered people out of Afghanistan. A representative for Kam Air didn't respond to requests for comment. Most of the original group of 188 evacuees made it to Mexico, transferring in Abu Dhabi to an EgyptAir flight that continued on to Mexico City via Cairo. The Kam Air employees and other last-minute additions to the Facebook flight remain in the UAE, where they are being vetted with other evacuees, according to administration officials. In a September 20 situation report, US diplomats stationed in Abu Dhabi said their post still ""awaits guidance"" on about 3,600 evacuees in the UAE -- many of whom escaped thanks to help from outside private groups -- “who are not confirmed as belonging to priority categories” such as US citizens or people in immediate danger. At a September 8 press conference, Secretary of State Antony Blinken praised charitable organisations and others that were working to evacuate people from Afghanistan. But he said such privately-founded airlifts create challenges with US personnel on the ground or normal security procedures. ""Some of the groups claiming to have all the documentations and arrangements locked down unfortunately don't,"" he said. While the Facebook flight has been reported previously, Bloomberg News has uncovered new details about it from those on board and others involved in planning the privately funded evacuation, including the involvement of Hoffman, the harrowing days and hours before takeoff, and the unexpected addition of nearly twice as many passengers. Eric Montalvo, a lawyer and former US Marine who helped arrange the flights, was unapologetic for the way the flight transpired, saying the plane had extra room for people whose lives were in danger if they remained in the country. “Extra lives being saved should never be associated with a complaint,” Montalvo said. “Life is precious. One cannot create the circumstances for failure and then blame the victims of that failure for their desire to survive.” The operation was organized by a private, Kirkland, Washington-based security firm called Concentric, with help from Facebook, Montalvo, Amman, Jordan-based Magenta Consulting, and nongovernmental organizations in the U.S. and elsewhere. Their evacuees were Afghan nationals and included at least 75 children, about 30 people affiliated with Facebook such as employees and their families, as well as aid workers, journalists and even a comedian. All of them were at risk of retaliation by the Taliban for their work if they remained in the country. Those evacuees were all on the manifest and the UAE knew they were coming, according to the organizers. “I went out into the private donor network of people that were interested in this and once we had formulated a plan we raised almost a million dollars in 24 hours,” said Roderick Jones, Concentric's executive chairman. “I've always felt there was a moment where you can put private capital and donor money to work where markets or governments can't find solutions. And it turned out this way because we could take the risks, and we could do this thing in the middle.” In a statement Facebook said, “In the process of assisting Facebook employees and close partners to leave Afghanistan, we joined an effort to help a group of journalists and their families who were in grave danger. Thanks to the leadership of the Mexican government and the support of the UAE in providing the initial landing, the journalists have been welcomed in Mexico.”   Hoffman was among the first to fund the effort, according to his philanthropic advisor Dmitri Mehlhorn, who was responding on Hoffman's behalf. He donated money for two other evacuation flights as well as support for Afghans upon arrival at their destinations, Mehlhorn said. Other tech entrepreneurs donated to the operation, according to Concentric, but their identities couldn't be confirmed.

Remarks by India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, came at a dinner event hosted by Indiaspora on Wednesday. ""We just had a very successful visit here,"" Mr Sandhu said. The dinner was attended by the who's who of the Indian-American community. Eminent members of the Indian-American community had gathered for the first time in Washington after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the US. During the visit, there was an important bilateral meeting between President Biden and Prime Minister Modi, the first one since the Biden-Harris administration was inaugurated in January this year. The two leaders had earlier met in 2014 and 2016 when Joe Biden was the vice president of the country. ""So, it was not the first time they were meeting, but the bilateral meeting was very good,"" Mr Sandhu said in his first public appearance after last week's visit of prime minister Modi. The interaction with US Vice-President Kamala Harris went very well, he said. The Quad summit hosted by Biden at the White House and attended by Modi along with their counterparts from Japan and Australia ""really went off very well,"" he said. ""There was a good candid and substantial exchange between all the four leaders,"" he said, adding that there are practical areas in which the corporation is moving quite ahead. ""In fact, in vaccines, all the four countries are bringing their respective strengths together and we are on our way to producing one billion vaccines in 2022 which will be distributed over the Indo-Pacific particularly in Southeast Asia,"" Mr Sandhu said. During his stay in Washington DC, Prime Minister Modi had two other bilaterals with Prime Minister Scott Morrison from Australia and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan. During his trips, the US handed over 150 historic antiquities to India, which the prime minister took with him on his return to India. From Washington DC, the Prime Minister went to New York where he addressed the UN General Assembly. Quickly running through some of the important areas during the trip in addition to the strategic ones, Sandhu said the prime minister had a good exchange on regional issues as well as other international challenges. ""Quad is a group of like-minded countries which are coming together because today's challenges are much international in nature. For example, COVID,"" he said. The US, India, Australia and Japan had in 2017 given shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the ""Quad"" or the Quadrilateral coalition to counter China's aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region. In affordable health care, he said, India is an important partner. ""There is tremendous scope for us, bilaterally to help each other and also to third countries,"" he said. As India resumes its export of vaccines, he noted there would be close cooperation with the United States and other like-minded countries   Digital, IT, startups and innovation holds a lot of promise in the bilateral relationship with the US. Climate change, environment and knowledge and education are other major areas of cooperation between the two countries.

A group of six women gathered outside a high school in eastern Kabul demanding the right for girls to return to secondary school, after the hardline Islamist group excluded them from classes earlier this month. The women unfurled a banner that read ""Don't break our pens, don't burn our books, don't close our schools"", before Taliban guards snatched it from them. They pushed back the women protesters as they tried to continue with the demonstration, while a foreign journalist was hit with a rifle and blocked from filming. A Taliban fighter also released a brief burst of gunfire into the air with his automatic weapon, AFP journalists saw. The demonstrators -- from a group called the ""Spontaneous Movement of Afghan Women Activists"" -- took refuge inside the school. Taliban guard Mawlawi Nasratullah, who led the group and identified himself as the head of special forces in Kabul, said the demonstrators ""did not coordinate with security authorities regarding their protest"". ""They have the right to protest in our country like every other country. But they must inform the security institutes before,"" he said. Isolated rallies with women at the forefront were staged in cities around the country after the Taliban seized power, including in the western city of Herat where two people were shot dead. But protests have dwindled since the government issued an order that unsanctioned demonstrations and warned of ""severe legal action"" for violators. It has been almost two weeks since girls were prevented from going to secondary school. The Taliban follow a strict interpretation of sharia law that segregates men and women, and have also slashed women's access to work.   They have said they need to establish the right conditions before girls can return to the classroom, but many Afghans are sceptical.

""Along with the Union Home Ministry, we're also searching for his whereabouts. I've heard something like that but as a government officer, he can't go abroad without government clearance. We've issued a Lookout Circular and if he went away, then it is not good,"" Mr Patil said, on reports of Mr Singh fleeing to Russia. ""Whether it is a minister, officer, or Chief Minister, there are limitations and without the permission of the government of India one cannot go outside the country. No one can cross these limitations. What action can be taken will have to be discussed with the centre. Maharashtra government is looking for him and once he is found we will decide,"" the Home Minister added. On February 25 this year, an SUV with gelatin sticks was found at Carmichael Road, near the residence of Mukesh Ambani. The car belonged to Mansukh Hiren whose body was later found in the Kalwa creek in Thane. A police officer, Sachin Waze, was named as the prime conspirator in the case of planting the explosives and the subsequent murder of Mansukh Hiren. Mr Waze was known to be close to Param Bir Singh and had direct access to him despite being just an Assistant Police Inspector. Mr Singh was transferred from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March after Mr Waze's arrest by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The NIA chargesheet in the case has not named Param Bir Singh as an accused but several revelations in the chargesheet could make things difficult for Param Bir Singh. After his transfer to the Home Guard department, the IPS officer made sensational accusations against then state home minister Anil Deshmukh of asking police officers to collect bribes from hotel and bar owners, an allegation the latter denied.   But Mr Deshmukh stepped down from his post subsequently as the CBI registered a case against him. Mr Deshmukh has also not responded to summons by the Enforcement Directorate which is probing money-laundering allegations against him. The ED has asked for help from the CBI to trace Mr Deshmukh. Mr Singh has also been named in at least four extortion complaints and Maharashtra Police Chief Sanjay Pandey recently sent a proposal to suspend Mr Singh and other police officials named in the extortion cases, but the state Home Department has sought more details, news agency PTI reported."

At 78, Mr Biden is one of the most experienced politicians to live in the White House. Before defeating Donald Trump he'd had 36 years as a senator and eight years as Barack Obama's vice president. Now he's having to rummage deep into that box of tricks to try and keep his administration's ambitions from dying in Congress. All week the Democrat's official daily agenda, sent out each evening by the White House, has been startlingly empty. His one big event, a trip to Chicago on Wednesday, was cancelled. Behind the scenes, though, Mr Biden has been scrambling, either huddling with Chief of Staff Ron Klain and other key aides, making calls to party members or meeting in person with Democratic leaders like Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Among the most frequent travelers along Pennsylvania Avenue between Congress and the White House have been Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. The duo, dubbed ""Manchema"", are keys to unlocking Mr Biden's stuck multi-trillion-dollar spending programmes that he says would transform the country for the better. The White House has also not ruled out Mr Biden himself going to Capitol Hill. ""We listen, we engage, we negotiate,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, when asked what the largely out-of-sight president is doing. ""I would say that we have had about 260 -- probably more, probably more like 300, now -- engagements with a range of members and their offices over the course of just September."" And it's not all talking and listening. There's eating and playing too. A week ago, there were what the White House described as ""Covid-safe snacks"" being dished out in the Oval Office on a day when the competing groups of Democratic lawmakers came in waves. Late Wednesday, it was time to deploy the president's favorite food: ice cream. Making a surprise appearance at the annual congressional baseball game, where Republicans and Democrats turn out for a charity sporting clash, Mr Biden personally distributed Dove bars in wrappers bearing the presidential seal. The Democrats narrowly lost the baseball game, but Ms Psaki says Mr Biden has a deep feel for winning the bigger games in Congress. ""He knows from doing this a few times -- many, many times -- that, ultimately, it's not more complicated than needing enough votes to get legislation across the finish line."" Hanging in the balance Will it be that simple? There's little surprise in Republicans trying everything to doom Biden's spending plan. They're even refusing to cooperate on authorising a US national debt increase -- brinkmanship that could in theory push the United States into default. The really difficult bit is that Mr Biden's thorniest problem lies inside his own party. Basically, there are two hugely ambitious bills awaiting votes: one for around $1 trillion in infrastructure spending and another costing up to $3.5 trillion -- paid through tax hikes on corporations and the wealthiest few -- to fund things like education, childcare and climate change mitigation. Mr Biden talks of this as a ""historic"" opportunity to repair a tattered nation physically and socially -- a chance to ""level the playing field"". Republicans support the smaller bill while unanimously opposing the bigger social spending one. That means on the larger version Mr Biden relies entirely on Democratic support and their razor-thin majority means they can't afford to lose a single vote in the Senate or more than a few in the House. And there's the problem. Mr Manchin and Ms Sinema are refusing -- so far -- to back the large bill, which means it can't get through the Senate. And left-wing House members are refusing to back the smaller bill unless they're sure the bigger one will pass too. The result? Total impasse. If Democrats can't unite, then both bills, Mr Biden's political credibility, and any hope of keeping Congress in Democratic hands at next year's midterm elections could go out the window. ""The fate of the entire Biden legislative agenda hangs in the balance,"" former Obama advisor Dan Pfieffer wrote in his newsletter Thursday. ""I don't say this lightly. The Dems are currently in #disarray.""     (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

A bench headed by Justice UU Lalit stressed on the intent to commit the sexual offence and said the results would be ""disastrous"" if the term ""physical contact"" in the provision is interpreted in a way where the skin-to-skin contact becomes necessary for constituting the offence. The top court reserved its verdict on two appeals filed against the Bombay High Court verdict, which had come under intense scrutiny, and had held that no offence of sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act is made out if there is no direct ""skin-to-skin contact between accused and the victim. The bench, also comprising Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi, discussed threadbare the definition of Section 7 of the POCSO Act which deals with the offence of sexual assault against the children. The provision says: ""Whoever, with sexual intent, touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, or does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration is said to commit sexual assault."" ""So, therefore, the primary thing is that if the sexual intent is proved then everything will fall in place,"" the bench orally observed while expressing its reservation on the interpretation made by the high court. Senior advocate Siddhath Luthra, appearing for the convict in the case as an amicus curiae, referred to the contents of the provision and said that there were issues with the first part of the provision which said if an accused, with sexual intent, ""touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person"" then the offence of sexual assault is made out. However, the second part of the provision said that for constituting the offence of sexual assault, an accused has to commit an act ""which involves physical contact without penetration"" and here the ""skin-to-skin"" interpretation creeps in. Mr Luthra said the second part ""requires sensitive interpretation"". One must rely on different situations to see whether a given interpretation logically holds and when an offence has been clearly laid down then if there was any need to stretch one's reasoning and rely on other provisions, the bench said. ""One must look at things from the victim's perspective. If a pen is used to poke a person, there is no skin-to-skin touch and according to arguments advanced there is no sexual assault. But there is an invasion of privacy and violation of modesty of the child,"" it said. ""If we accept the submission (on physical contact without cloth), what kind of results will we get. According to us, the results will be disastrous,"" it observed. Mr Luthra said the legislature consciously used the term ''physical act'' in the second part of the provision. ""So, do we understand your submission that the first part skin to skin need not be there? According to you, in the second part skin to skin contact is essential,"" the bench asked. Another amicus curiae Siddhart Dave and others argued in the case and the counsel for Maharashtra adopted the submissions of Attorney General KK Venugopal who had vehemently argued for the setting aside of the verdict by the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court. While reserving the verdict, the bench asked parties to file their written submissions within three days. Mr Venugopal had earlier told the top court that the controversial verdict of the Bombay High Court would set a ""dangerous and outrageous precedent"" and needed to be reversed. The top court, which was hearing separate appeals of Attorney General and the National Commission for Women (NCW), had on January 27 stayed the order which had acquitted a man under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act saying ""groping a minor's breast without ''skin to skin contact'' cannot be termed as sexual assault"". Two judgments were passed by Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench). Earlier, while staying the judgements, the top court had also issued notice to the Maharashtra government and permitted the Attorney General to file an appeal against the verdict. The verdict had said groping a minor's breast without ""skin-to-skin contact"" cannot be termed as sexual assault as defined under the POCSO Act. It had said since the man groped the child without removing her clothes the offence cannot be termed as sexual assault but it does constitute the offence of outraging a woman's modesty under IPC section 354. The high court had modified the order of a sessions court, which had sentenced a 39-year-old man to three years of imprisonment for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl.   The verdict had held that mere groping will not fall under the definition of sexual assault. As per the prosecution and the minor victim's testimony in court, in December 2016, the accused, one Satish, had taken the girl to his house in Nagpur on the pretext of giving her something to eat.

A suicide note left by the 25-year-old, signed Savi Madappa -- her real name -- along with her screen name, speaks about problems with her mental health and not being able to cope. The actress, a native of Karnataka's Kodagu district but living in Bengaluru, has repeatedly apologised in the four-page note to her parents and other family members and friends. It seems to have been written over three days, suggesting she was contemplating suicide through this time. There is no indication of her having reached out for help. ""I am only responsible for this...so family, please forgive me...I had promised I'll never do such stupid thing in my life but I had no option. I was totally killed inside. Day by day, I was going so low. I never seen me before like before,"" the note said. The Covid lockdown has been tough, like many others, on those working in the television and film industry. Many have been pushed into economic distress and some have spoken about depression.   In January this year, actress and Kannada Bigg Boss contestant Jayasree Ramaiah died by suicide. Last July, the same actress had put up a Facebook post saying she was quitting, but subsequently deleted the post.  "

The status of assessment for Covaxin is ""ongoing"". Bharat Biotech had submitted EOI (Expression of Interest) on April 19 for its vaccine. The latest 'Status of COVID-19 vaccines within WHO EUL/PQ evaluation process' guidance document dated September 29 on the WHO website said that the decision date for Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is ""October 2021"". The WHO said it began rolling data of the vaccine on July 6. Rolling data allows the WHO to start its review right away, as information continues to come in, to accelerate the overall review process. According to the WHO, submissions to WHO for prequalification or listing under the emergency use procedure are confidential. If a product submitted for assessment is found to meet the criteria for listing, the WHO will publish the results widely. Duration of the emergency use listing process depends on the quality of the data submitted by the vaccine manufacturer and on those data meeting WHO criteria, according to the agency. Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and AstraZeneca and Oxford University's Covishield are the two widely used vaccines in India. Bharat Biotech recently said it submitted all data pertaining to Covaxin to the WHO for EUL and is awaiting feedback from the global health watchdog. ""COVAXIN clinical trial data was fully compiled & available in June 2021. All Data submitted for Emergency Use Listing (EUL) Application to World Health Organization in early July. We have responded to any clarifications sought by WHO and are awaiting further feedback,"" Bharat Biotech had tweeted earlier this month.   ""We are diligently working with the WHO to obtain EUL at the earliest,"" the company had said on Tuesday.

In its meeting held on Wednesday, the collegium approved the proposal for elevation of 16 names - six judicial officers and 10 advocates - as judges of these four high courts. As per the statements uploaded on the Supreme Court website today, the collegium has approved the proposal for elevation of four judicial officers - AL Pansare, SC More, US Joshi-Phalke and BP Deshpande - as judges of the Bombay High Court. Similarly, the collegium has recommended names of advocates Aditya Kumar Mohapatra and Mruganka Sekhar Sahoo and judicial officers Radha Krishna Pattanaik and Sashikanta Mishra for their elevation as judges of the Orissa High Court.

The former Union Minister was joined by other veterans of the group of 23 informally known as G-23 in condemning the attack. Other members of the group which had last year written to party chief Sonia Gandhi demanding an organisational overhaul termed the attack ""orchestrated hooliganism"". Congress workers protested outside Mr Sibal's house and damaged a car after he raised questions over the party's functioning and attacked its leadership amid the latest crisis in Punjab. Senior leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Vivek Tankha and Raj Babbar were among those who rallied behind Mr Sibal, with Mr Sharma asking Ms Gandhi to take strong action against those involved. Former Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also criticised what he said was an ""attack"" at the house of Mr Sibal by Congress workers only because he ""chose to express views that were not palatable to the party leadership"". This does not augur well for the party, Mr Singh said, adding that it was unfortunate that the seniors are being ""completely sidelined"", which is not good for the party. Terming the senior Congressmen as ""thinkers"", who were important to the future of the party, the former Chief Minister in a statement said the younger leadership should be promoted to implement the plans, which the senior leaders are best equipped to formulate.   Mr Azad, former leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, also strongly condemned the ""orchestrated hooliganism"" at Mr Sibal's residence. Former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said, ""Orchestrated hooliganism outside Kapil Sibal's residence last night is not the culture of the Congress."""

Howrah, Hooghly, Birbhum and Bankura districts, areas of Purba and Paschim Medinipur districts besides the industrial areas of Asansol and Durgapur in Paschim Barddhaman district are likely to be flooded, he said. According to a report of the department, water discharged from down Durgapur barrage till 5.30 pm was down 2,04,000 cusec, while the combined discharge of DVC was 1,00,000 cusec. ""This is a very grave situation. With heavy rainfall in the last few days in our state and Jharkhand and enhanced water discharge by dams, West Bengal is heading towards another flood. This is inevitable,"" Mr Mahapatra said. In early August parts of south Bengal experienced flood and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had alleged that ""man made flood"" was caused by excessive release of water by Damodar Valley Corporation which had hit lakhs of farmers and claimed 16 lives.

Asansol in West Burdwan recorded 434.5 mm rainfall in 24 hours till Thursday morning, while Bankura, the headquarter town of Bankura district, recorded 354.3 mm rain during the period, it said in a bulletin.

India's reaction came in response to China's fresh allegation that the ""root cause"" of the tensions between the two countries was New Delhi following a ""forward policy"" and ""illegally"" encroaching Chinese territory.

As the first-ever Indian port operator in Sri Lanka, Adani Group will have a 51 per cent stake at the port's Western Container Terminal (WCT), a statement said. Adani Group signed a build-operate-transfer (BOT) agreement with its local partner John Keells Holdings and the SLPA to develop the WCT at the Colombo Port, it said. The two local entities would hold 34 and 15 per cent stakes of the new joint company titled the West Container International Terminal. The Colombo Port is one of the most preferred regional hubs for transhipment of Indian containers and mainline ship operators with 45 per cent of Colombo's transhipment volumes originating from or destined to an Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) terminal in India. APSEZ is the largest port developer and operator in India and represents 24 per cent of the country's total port capacity. The WCT proposal came after Sri Lanka decided to retract the previous memorandum of understanding signed in 2019 with India and Japan on the Eastern Container Terminal (ECT). The state-owned SLPA signed a memorandum of cooperation in May 2019 with India and Japan to develop the ECT during the previous Sirisena government. The Colombo Port trade unions opposed the proposal of investors from India and Japan buying 49 per cent stake in the ETC. They demanded the ECT to remain 100 per cent owned by the SLPA as opposed to the 51 per cent. Under pressure from trade unions, Sri Lanka Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa agreed to scrap the deal, prompting India to demand Sri Lanka to abide by its commitment to the trilateral deal with it and Japan. Both India and Japan found fault with Sri Lanka for reneging on an international agreement unilaterally. Japan had also conveyed its unhappiness with the Sri Lankan government. India and Japan are members of ""Quad"" or the Quadrilateral coalition of four Indo-Pacific nations that also includes the US and Australia. The four countries had in 2017 given shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the 'Quad' to counter China's aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region. China's influence is growing in various infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka as part of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. China has invested over USD 8 billion in infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka. Colombo handed over its Hambantota port to Beijing in 2017 as a debt swap.

A senior official from UN Environment today said that he understands and resonates with Ms Thunberg's comments but it is a complicated subject and everybody needs to work harder to change the situation. Niklas Hagelberg, Coordinator of UN Environment's sub-programme on Climate Change said, ""I am also frustrated. By now the science has been clear for years. It has been clear for longer than I have lived on this planet and I am 47 years old. But it's a very complex issue that we are talking about. It is a common atmosphere so every emission goes into the same pot. It comes from everything - from our food systems to how we move around. I understand the ""blah blah"". I feel like that many times and we need to work harder. From individuals to private sector and governments, everybody needs to pull up their socks."" Mr Hagelberg made the remarks while responding to questions from a group of journalists from around the world, during a virtual address. He also highlighted that unification towards the issue gets harder as each country comes to the table with its own interests. He said, ""There is an Article called Article 8 under the Paris Agreement... Article 8 on ""Loss and Damage"" and its being negotiated. It is connected to the finance issue. It is currently being discussed but its turning out to be one of the most difficult things and I don't know if countries will be able to agree on it. Each of these countries when they come for negotiation have a different position, different interests, different circumstances and it is difficult for them to find that common ground. I think that is what largely Greta with her ""blah blah blah"" comment referred to. That you all keep on talking. But the truth also is that one country maybe sinking, the other's GDP might be heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially countries in the Middle East and it is an overhaul of their entire economy. With some countries, 90 per cent of their GDP is dependent on fossil fuels. We as United Nations would never go out and say that a specific country is a problem but yes sharing of common ground is complex in nature."" Greta Thunberg had recently criticised global leaders over their promises to address the climate emergency and dismissed them as ""blah, blah, blah"" while she was giving a speech at the Youth4Climate summit in Milan on Tuesday.   She quoted statements by UK's Boris Johnson: ""This is not some expensive, politically correct, green act of bunny hugging,"" and Prime Minister Narendra Modi: ""Fighting climate change calls for innovation, cooperation and willpower"". Ms Thunberg then said, ""Build back better. Blah, blah, blah. Green economy. Blah blah blah. Net zero by 2050. Blah, blah, blah"". ""This is all we hear from our so-called leaders. Words that sound great but so far have not led to action. Our hopes and ambitions drown in their empty promises. Of course we need constructive dialogue.

The study was done by ''C40 Cities'', a network of the world's megacities committed to addressing climate change. Among all the five cities, the study shows that West Bengal's Kolkata has seen 2,200 premature deaths due to coal power plants in 2019. However, the government is planning to expand the coal plants by 28 per cent between 2020-2030 but that it could lead to additional 1,060 premature deaths in 2030. ""Other cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi/NCT and Bengaluru would experience an additional increase in premature deaths in 2030 planned expansion by 160, 500, 250 and 200, respectively,"" the study observes. Dr Rachel Huxley, Head of Knowledge and Research at ''C40 Cities'' said, ""Current national plans would expand the coal fleet by 28 per cent between 2020 and 2030 and not reducing it by 20 per cent, threatening the health and well-being of the urban residents in Delhi while undermining India's climate and air quality targets."" She further stated, ""Current national plans could nearly double the number of annual premature deaths from coal power plants air pollution in the city."" It has been estimated that a coal expansion would result in a total of 3,770 life-years lived with disabilities. The study suggests reducing India's total annual Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 11 per cent per year, which would be the equivalent of taking 60 million vehicles off the road for a year. Around Delhi, 37 coal units (6.6 GW), the oldest, most polluting and least cost-effective plants, could already retire in the next two years, followed by 21 (5.7 GW) other coal units by 2030 and a full phase-out by 2045, the study observes. Various studies showed how air pollution from coal-fired power plants is linked with asthma, cancer, heart and lung ailments, neurological problems, acid rain, global warming, and other severe environmental and public health impacts.

The state-run vends have been instructed to keep sufficient stocks, the government said. Under its new excise policy, the Delhi government has allocated fresh licences to private firms for 850 shops that will enter the retail business from November 17. In view of this, all the private liquor vends were directed to shut down by September 30. The remaining liquor stores run by the Delhi government agencies will also wrap up business on November 16. During this transition period of nearly one-and-half-month, only government-run shops will be open which is likely to cause a shortage and other problems. In a statement, the Delhi government said the national capital is going to witness a transition phase in liquor management. ""However, the Delhi government is putting its best foot forward to ensure that the residents do not face much of a problem, "" it said. ""Government-owned liquor shops have been instructed to make sure they have sufficient stocks to fulfil demands during this period. The liquor shops have been directed to release payments on time to suppliers so that the supply chains don't get choked,"" the statement said. However, with privately-run shops selling out their stocks and making no fresh orders weeks in advance due to the September 30 deadline, consumers in many parts of the city had been complaining of a shortage. ""My neighbourhood shop had sold out its stock and started turning back customers after which I had to look to other shops in the area. If there is a further crisis, I will have to bring my liquor brand from Noida or Ghaziabad,"" said Laxmi Nagar resident Ramesh Kumar. Naresh Goel, president of Delhi Liquor Traders Association, said private liquor vends in many areas are already shut after selling out stocks earlier this week. ""The shortage was visible today as private liquor vends shut shops leading to crowds and long queues outside government-owned vends,"" he claimed. There are around 720 active liquor vends out of which nearly 260 or 40% are privately run. The government expects that sufficient supply at government vends will prevent crowding. ""We expect that in a situation where sufficient supply is maintained, crowding or any other incidents will not take place. We want to reassure the public that they do not need to hoard or rush to stores in this situation as all government-owned shops will continue to function,"" its statement said. Naresh Goel said the 260 private vends closing down from September 30, used to gross around ₹ 20 crore in daily sales. ""Closure of these shops will create shortage besides revenue loss to the government. Also, thousands employed there will be rendered jobless,"" he said. The new excise policy aims at revolutionising the consumer experience by replacing the existing liquor vends in the nooks and corners of the city, with swanky liquor stores spread over at least 500 square feet area with a walk-in facility. It stipulates that the new liquor stores will have to be equipped with air-conditioning and CCTV cameras. It also bars selling liquor through grilled shops with people crowding outside on roads and pavements. The policy also provides for various facilities like wine tasting and a variety of brands for the consumers.   In the bidding of 850 liquor vends divided into 32 zones under the new excise policy, the government earlier this month earned around ₹ 8,911 crore, against the base reserve licence fee of ₹ 7,039 crore. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had earlier said the government expected revenue of ₹ 10,000 crore after the implementation of the new policy."

Even, Navjot Singh Sidhu himself wants to become the chief minister of Punjab."" He further slammed the new cabinet of Punjab under the leadership of newly-appointed chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. ""All the new cabinet ministers of Punjab are corrupt.

He also said the kind of situation that Navjot Sidhu has created was never seen before in Punjab. Asked if Navjot Sidhu is undermining Mr Channi's authority, the veteran Congress leader, who returned to Chandigarh today evening after a visit to Delhi, said, ""I think so."" ""Navjot Sidhu's job is to run party affairs and Charanjit Channi's job is to run the government. There is never any interference. I have been the PCC chief thrice. ""The two (Pradesh Congress Committee chief and the chief minister) consult each other, but the final decision is of Charanjit Channi, who is the chief minister, not Navjot Sidhu,"" Amarinder Singh told reporters at the Chandigarh airport. Navjot Sidhu abruptly resigned as the state Congress chief on Tuesday, plunging the ruling party in Punjab into fresh crisis months ahead of the Assembly polls. The cricketer-turned-politician raised questions on Wednesday over the appointments of the state's director-general of police, advocate general, and ""tainted"" leaders as ministers. Replying to a question on whom to remove from the Cabinet or appoint as ministers, Amarinder Singh said these decisions have to be taken by the chief minister. ""To appoint, remove or transfer ministers or officers is the chief minister's job. What does the PCC president have to do with it?"" he asked. Amarinder Singh said over the nine-and-a-half years when he was the chief minister (2002-07 and March 2017 to September 2021), there have been many PCC chiefs. ""We used to talk and consult each other, but the kind of situation that Navjot Sidhu has created was never seen,"" he added. Asked to comment on the current developments in the state, Amarinder Singh said, ""I have already said that Navjot Sidhu is not the right man for Punjab."" ""And from wherever he contests, I will not let him win,"" the former chief minister asserted. The Captain had earlier accused Sidhu of being close to Pakistan and its Prime Minister Imran Khan and had alleged that he was ""dangerous"" for the border state. Asked if any Congress MLAs or ministers would follow him when he formally parts way with the party, he asked, ""Do you think I will tell you this?"" On a question on whether there should be a floor test in the Assembly in view of the current situation within the Punjab Congress, Amarinder Singh said, ""These matters are for the Speaker to see... It is not my job."" Asked about media reports suggesting that he could float a regional party ahead of the Assembly polls, he evaded a direct reply, but quipped in a lighter vein, ""Media reports also said that I was joining the BJP at 12 noon today."" Amarinder Singh again reiterated that he will not join BJP but said he will quit the Congress. ""I am not going to remain in the Congress, but I am not joining the BJP,"" he said. Asked when will he resign from the Congress, Amarinder Singh said, ""I will tell you at an appropriate time."" During his visit to the national capital, Amarinder Singh held separate meetings with Union Home Minister Amit Shah and National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval. He resigned as the chief minister on September 18 after accusing the Congress of humiliating him.   Mr Singh said during his meeting with Amit Shah and Ajit Doval, he raised security concerns as Punjab is a border state. ""There are issues related to security, which I raised. For the last four years, I have been seeing what is happening in Punjab. Drones are coming (from across the border) on a daily basis.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said Wayne Couzens, who was found guilty of killing 33-year-old Sarah Everard, had ""brought shame"" on the police force by abusing his ""position of trust"". The Old Bailey court in London heard how Couzens, 48, used COVID-19 lockdown laws to wrongfully arrest Everard on her way back from a friend's home in London in March, before handcuffing her and driving her off in his car. ""I am absolutely horrified that this man used his position of trust to deceive and coerce Sarah and I know you all are too... what he did was unthinkable and appalling,"" Cressida Dick read out in her statement after his sentencing. ""He has very considerably added to the sense of insecurity that many have in our cities, perhaps particularly women. I am absolutely sickened... this man has brought shame on the Met. We have been rocked,"" she said. ""I recognise that a precious bond of trust has been damaged. I will do everything in my power to ensure we learn any lessons. There are no words that can fully express the fury and overwhelming sadness that we all feel about what happened to Sarah. I am so sorry,"" she added. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""sickened"" by the details that emerged during sentencing. ""Our police are there to protect us - and I know that officers will share in our shock and devastation at the total betrayal of this duty. People must be able to walk on our streets without fear of harm and with full confidence that the police are there to keep them safe,"" he said. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel also described the crimes as ""sickening"", adding: ""It is right that he has been given a whole-life tariff and with that he can never walk the streets of our country again."" Asked to comment on some Opposition demands for Met Police chief Cressida Dick to resign, Ms Patel said: ""I will continue to work with the Metropolitan Police and the commissioner to hold them to account as everybody would expect me to do, and I will continue to do that."" During the sentencing of Couzens, the judge said the case was ""devastating, tragic and wholly brutal"" and categorised its seriousness as ""exceptionally high"". ""Notwithstanding your guilty pleas, therefore, I have seen no evidence of genuine contrition on your part, as opposed to evident self-pity and attempts by you to avoid or minimise the proper consequences of what you have done,"" Lord Justice Fulford said. Everard's family said they were relieved by the fact that Couzens would die in jail. The young marketing executive had been strangled with Couzens' police-issue belt in March this year. The court heard how Couzens, who was married with two children, then burned her body in a refrigerator in an area of woodland. The case had triggered a massive public outcry in the UK with the government stepping in to pledge greater action on acts of violence against women.

But now safely in Portugal, she hopes to pursue her dream of playing soccer professionally -- and perhaps meeting her idol, star striker Cristiano Ronaldo. Sarah was one of several players from Afghanistan's national female youth soccer squad who fled their country in fear after the Taliban hardline Islamist movement seized power in August. Portugal has granted asylum to the young footballers. ""I'm free,"" she said, smiling from ear-to-ear as she visited Lisbon's landmark Belem Tower on the River Tagus with her mother and teammates. ""My dream is to be a good player like Ronaldo - and I want to be a big business woman here in Portugal,"" she said. She hoped to go back home one day but only if she can live freely. Her mother, who requested that Reuters did not use their surname, had experienced first-hand a previous era of Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001. She is less optimistic they will ever be able to return. Taliban leaders have promised to respect women's rights but under their first government, women could not work and girls were banned from school. Women had to cover their faces and be accompanied by a male relative when they left home. A senior Taliban official said after the August 15 takeover that women would probably not be allowed to play sport because it was ""not necessary"" and their bodies might be exposed. ""The reason we took on this mission (to evacuate the team) was to ensure they can aspire and play the sport they love,"" said Farkhunda Muhtaj, captain of the Afghanistan women's senior national team, who flew to Lisbon on Wednesday to surprise the youth team players.

""So far I am in the Congress but I will not remain in the Congress. I have already made my position very clear. I will not be treated in this manner,"" the Captain said in an interview a day after meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi. Soon after the reveal, he dropped ""Congress"" from his Twitter bio. A formal resignation would come at an ""appropriate time"", he said. Pulling no punches, the Captain also predicted the Congress's downfall in Punjab - in the run-up to the polls - and called his rival Navjot Singh Sidhu a ""childish man"" who had been given a serious job by the party. ""I have been in politics for 52 years. I have my own beliefs, my own principles. The way I have been treated... At 10.30 am the Congress President says you resign. I didn't ask any questions. I said I will do it just now. At 4 pm I went to the Governor and resigned... If you doubt me after 50 years and my credibility is at stake... if there is no trust, what is the point of me staying in the party?"" Before quitting on September 18, Amarinder Singh had told Sonia Gandhi that he had been humiliated thrice by the party. ""I have made my stand very clear to the Congress that I will not be treated in this manner. I will not stand for it. I have not resigned from the Congress yet, but how can one continue in a place where there is a trust deficit? When there is no trust, one cannot continue,"" he said. On the big question that all, including the Congress, have for him after his meeting with Amit Shah, Mr Singh asserted: ""I am not joining the BJP"". He added: ""I have not resigned from the Congress but I will resign. I am not a person who takes split-second decisions. But I am not joining the BJP."" Navjot Sidhu, who played a big role in the two-time Chief Minister's abrupt exit, has also stunned the party by resigning as Punjab Congress chief. ""Sidhu is an immature person. I have said this repeatedly, that he is not a stable man. He is not a team player. He is a loner. How will he handle the Punjab Congress as its chief? For that you need to be a team player, which Sidhu is not,"" Mr Singh said. ""Sidhu is good at drawing crowds. He is good at drama. He can do what he did in Kapil Sharma's show and get a crowd, but he is not a serious guy. How can a non-serious person be taking serious, major decisions in the running of a party and the state government?"" On Rahul Gandhi, who is facing criticism for his handling of the Punjab leadership mess, Mr Singh said: ""He wants to bring young blood into the party but refuses to listen to the advice of older party leaders."" The Captain predicted doom for the Congress in the Punjab election due early next year. ""The Congress is going downhill. In the current scenario, we see in a recent survey done by the Congress between July and September that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is going up and the Congress is going down. The people clearly don't have any trust in Sidhu. Congress has seen a 20% decline according to that survey,"" he said. ""This election will be very different with Congress, AAP, Akali Dal, factions of the Akali Dal, and there may be another front emerging too... so, it will be a very different election,"" he commented. Was he preparing to set up a new outfit? Mr Singh did not answer. Amid signs of another high-profile exit, the Congress had reached out to Amarinder Singh. Sources said senior Congress leaders Ambika Soni and Kamal Nath tried to placate Mr Singh. But the Captain, who has been in Delhi since Tuesday, tellingly never sought any meeting with his party president as he continues his meetings with the ""other side"".   The former Chief Minister met with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval this morning. Sources say he may have discussed Punjab border security amid political turmoil in the state. The 79-year-old stalwart had till now kept the Congress on edge, neither confirming nor denying that he is exploring his options after his exit."

AAP, he said, is on the rise in the state, fuelled by the decline of the Congress and this, he said, has been the findings of a recent survey by his own party. The survey -- done by the Congress between July and September -- shows that it has ""seen a 20% decline"", said the former Chief Minister. ""This election will be very different with the Congress, AAP, Akali Dal, factions of the Akali Dal, and there may be another front emerging too... so, it will be a very different election,"" Mr Singh told NDTV in an exclusive interview. Mr Singh, who has confessed to being ""humiliated"" by the Congress leadership thrice in his face-off with arch-rival Navjot Singh Sidhu, also said he would not be staying with the party any longer. But neither would he migrate to the BJP, he added, dismissing speculation about the matter triggered by his meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah yesterday. The year-long feud most of which was carried out publicly, is seen to have lowered the party's chances of a second term, even though the section of MLAs opposing Mr Singh had put it down to his government's lack of performance. AAP -- which has been targeting neighbouring Punjab since its stupendous victory in Delhi in 2015 -- has not been able to make sufficient headway in the state in elections so far. While in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, it won four of the state's 13 seats, its performance in the 2017 state elections fell short of target despite a massive initial surge of support. The party could only win 20 of the 117 assembly seats with a 23.8 per cent vote share. This time, Arvind Kejriwal, who has been making regular visits to the state, has again applied the Delhi formula, promising the state free power and water.   Today, he followed up those initial promises with another eight on healthcare -- which includes free treatment, mohalla clinics and upgraded infrastructure in government hospitals.   But the party's failure to project a face for the top post so far is seen as a serious drawback."

In line with the vision of the prime minister, Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation 2.0 have been designed to realise the aspiration to make all cities garbage free and water secure, the Prime Minister''s Office (PMO) said in a statement on Thursday. PM Modi will launch the two initiatives at 11 am at the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre in Delhi, it said. These flagship missions signify a step forward in the march towards effectively addressing the challenges of rapidly urbanising India and will also help contribute towards achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030, the statement said. Union Minister for Housing & Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State for Housing & Urban Affairs Kaushal Kishore as well as ministers of urban development of states and union territories will also be present on the occasion. Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 envisions to make all cities ''garbage free'' and ensure grey and black water management in all cities other than those covered under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, make all urban local bodies open defecation free plus and those with a population of less than one lakh as open defecation free plus, thereby achieving the vision of safe sanitation in urban areas. The mission will focus on source segregation of solid waste, utilising the principles of 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle), scientific processing of all types of municipal solid waste and remediation of legacy dumpsites for effective solid waste management, the statement said. The outlay of Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 is around ₹ 1.41 lakh crore, it said. Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation 2.0 aims at providing 100 per cent coverage of water supply to all households in around 4,700 urban local bodies by providing about 2.68 crore tap connections and 100 per cent coverage of sewerage and septage in 500 AMRUT cities by providing around 2.64 crore sewer or septage connections, which will benefit more than 10.5 crore people in urban areas, the PMO said. Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation 2.0 will adopt the principles of circular economy and promote conservation and rejuvenation of surface and groundwater bodies, it said. The mission will promote data-led governance in water management and technology sub-mission to leverage the latest global technologies and skills, it said. ''Pey Jal Survekshan'' will be conducted to promote progressive competition among cities. The outlay of AMRUT 2.0 is around ₹ 2.87 lakh crore, the statement said. Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation have contributed significantly to improve urban landscape during the last seven years, PMO said. The two flagship missions have augmented the capacity to deliver basic services of water supply and sanitation to the citizens, the statement said. ''Swachhta'' has become a jan andolan today, all urban local bodies have been declared open defecation free and 70 per cent solid waste is being scientifically processed now, the statement said.   Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation has been ensuring water security by adding 1.1 crore household water tap connections and 85 lakh sewer connections, thus benefiting more than 4 crore people.

Congress workers protested outside Kapil Sibal's house and reportedly damaged a car after he questioned the party's functioning and attacked its leadership. Senior leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Vivek Tankha and Raj Babbar were among those who rallied behind Kapil Sibal, with Anand Sharma asking the leadership to take strong action against those involved. Former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh also criticised what he said was an ""attack"" because Mr Sibal ""chose to express views that were not palatable to the party leadership"". This does not augur well for the party, Amarinder Singh said, adding that it was unfortunate that the seniors are being ""completely sidelined"", which is not good for the party. Terming the senior Congressmen as ""thinkers"", who were important to the future of the party, the former chief minister in a statement said the younger leadership should be promoted to implement the plans, which the senior leaders are best equipped to formulate. Ghulam Nabi Azad, former leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, also strongly condemned the ""orchestrated hooliganism"" at Kapil Sibal's residence. ""He (Kapil Sibal) is a loyal Congressman fighting for the party both inside and outside Parliament. Any suggestion from any quarter should be welcomed instead of suppressing, hooliganism is unacceptable,"" tweeted Mr Azad, who along with Kapil Sibal is part of the ""Group of 23"" which last year had written to Sonia Gandhi seeking organisational overhaul of the party. Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said, ""Orchestrated hooliganism outside Kapil Sibal's residence last night is not the culture of the Congress."" ""If one has any difference of views, the same should be brought up and discussed at party forum,"" he said on Twitter. Asserting that differences in opinion and perception are integral to democracy, Anand Sharma, also a part of the G-23, said intolerance and violence is alien to Congress values and culture. ""Shocked and disgusted to hear the news of attack and hooliganism at Kapil Sibal's house. This deplorable action brings disrepute to the party and needs to be strongly condemned,"" Mr Sharma said in a series of tweets. He asserted that the Congress has a history of upholding freedom of expression. Those responsible must be identified and disciplined, Mr Sharma said. ""Urging Congress president Sonia Gandhi to take cognisance and strong action,"" he said in a tweet. Congress MP from Punjab Manish Tewari - one of the G-23 leaders - unequivocally condemned the attack and tweeted, ""Those who masterminded the assault must bear in mind that he fights for @INCIndia both inside and outside courts of law. You may find his views uncomfortable but that cannot be a license for violence."" In another tweet, he said, ""Those who are trying to defend the ""command performance"" last night. This is what happened @KapilSibal's house. They damaged the car. Stood on top, so it caved in. Threw tomatoes both outside and inside the house. If this is not hooliganism then what else is it"". Responding to Mr Tewari's tweet, Shashi Tharoor - also a G-23 leader - tweeted, ""That is shameful. We all know @KapilSibal as a true Congressman who has fought multiple cases in court for @INCIndia."" ""As a democratic party we need to listen to what he has to say, disagree if you must but not in this way. Our priority is to strengthen ourselves to take on the BJP!"" he said. Also responding to Mr Tewari's tweet, Congress leader Vivek Tankha tweeted, ""Never to a person who has fought and saved so many Congress governments and persons and unmake opposition government. ""People may disagree with him. Even protest. But not damage his car. At least in my life I never encouraged or promoted hooliganism,"" Mr Tankha said. Another Congress leader Raj Babbar said, ""Don't unleash mob-power on ideological co-travelers - you will look more pitiful in front of ideological rivals."" ""Is criticising what happened outside Kapil Sibal's residence not a part of Congress culture,"" he asked in a tweet in Hindi. Soon after he raised questions over the functioning of the Congress, Kapil Sibal on Wednesday came under attack with party workers also protesting outside his house in Delhi. In the wake of several Congress leaders quitting the party and its Punjab unit in turmoil, Kapil Sibal has demanded that an immediate meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) be convened and wondered who in the party was taking decisions in the absence of a full-time president.   At a press conference, Mr Sibal said that the G-23 grouping is ""not a Jee Huzoor-23"" and will continue to put forth the views and will continue to repeat the demands. Carrying ""Get Well Soon Kapil Sibal"" placards and raising slogans against him, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) workers had protested outside his Jor Bagh residence, saying they were ""hurt"" by his remarks. The protesters raised slogans against Kapil Sibal, asking him to ""leave the party"". A protestor also stood on his car."

The family of the businessman Manish Gupta (36) said the chief minister has ""accepted all our demands and we are satisfied with the meeting"". Mr Gupta's wife Meenakshi told the media after the meeting the CM has asked them to submit an application for a CBI inquiry, and has also ""accepted my plea of a government job as well as financial security for my son's future"". ""Taking note of the seriousness of the matter, he said the case will be transferred to Kanpur from Gorakhpur. Just like the head of a family, he heard all our problems and I am thankful to him,"" she said Sources in the chief minister's office in Lucknow said Meenakshi will be given the job of an officer on special duty in the Development Authority. Manish Gupta (36) died in a Gorakhpur hotel during a police raid Monday night, with his family alleging he was fatally thrashed by police. A murder case has been registered against six policemen and a hunt has been launched to nab them, Senior Superintendent of Police Vipin Tada had said on Wednesday. Earlier addressing a public meeting here, the chief minister termed Gupta's death an ""unfortunate incident"" and reiterated that no one found guilty will be spared. ""All those found guilty will not be allowed to go unpunished. We will fix their responsibility,"" said the chief minister, who was here to lay the foundation stone and inaugurate several government schemes. ""You all know that our government has zero tolerance policy against crime and criminals,"" he said, adding that criminals are just criminals for his government. Mr Adityanath said that after the incident came to his notice, he told the Gorakhpur Police that an FIR should be lodged in the case on the very same day. Referring to Opposition leaders who came here to meet the family, the CM said he was surprised over it. He said he had told the officials in the morning that he would like to meet the family of Manish Gupta during his visit here. Manish Gupta died in a Gorakhpur hotel during a police raid late on Monday night, prompting the authorities to suspend six policemen and book them on the charge of murder. Gupta was staying with two friends in the hotel. Police had earlier denied the charge and said he received a head injury after he fell on the ground as he was in a drunken state.

""Of course, he had approached me. Just a few days back,"" he said when asked if Mr Kishor had reached out to him to join the party that the strategist helped win an exceptionally difficult election against the BJP in Bengal in May. ""He didn't tell me to join the TMC but he did an analysis. People in Goa are angry with BJP. Mining has stopped. The economy is in a meltdown. There are no jobs. Goa is looking for an alternative. Didi is the only force. Despite the pressure, they abused her, used government agencies. The country needs a leader like Didi,"" he said. Speaking at a press conference earlier in the day, Mr Faleiro had said, ""Believe it or not I never met them (Mamata Banerjee and Abhishek Banerjee). They are great leaders. They are not great leaders of Trinamool but great national leaders. But I did not meet them. I met I-PAC, I met Mr Prashant Kishor of I-PAC (Indian Political Action Committee). I met him. Just before I took the decision, we had the interaction."" ""It was a very, very difficult decision for me to leave Congress party. But finally, in the interest of Goa and in the interest of the country, to defeat the BJP, this is the only way for me to go forward and even now I am looking forward to help from I-PAC members. They are not from Bengal but different parts of the country,"" he said. Mr Faleiro's revelation raises questions of conflict of interest over Mr Kishor's political role. Until recently, he is believed to have been engaged in talks with the Congress to revive its fortunes ahead of the next Lok sabha elections, but if Mr Faleiro is to be believed, Mr Kishor is also approaching Congress leaders to cross over to the Trinamool, with whom his group I-PAC, continues to work with. Spurred, in part, by these high-profile crossovers from the Congress to the Trinamool, the past few weeks has seen a sharp rise in rhetoric between the two parties, with Mamata Banerjee's nephew Abhishek Banerjee saying ""The Congress has to leave its armchair politics and social media politics and hit the streets"" and that it ""does not work, does not hit the street and loves to remain in the comfort of their homes"". A day after joining the Trinamool, Mr Faleiro said the party plans to contest all 40 seats in the next year's Goa Assembly polls on its own, without forging any alliance. The former Goa Chief Minister also said Mamata Banerjee will visit the state once the ongoing 15-day ''pitru paksh'' period, which is considered inauspicious for launching new projects, gets over. Mr Faleiro joined the Trinamool on Wednesday in Kolkata along with nine other leaders. He addressed the news conference in Panaji in the presence of senior Trinamool leaders, including Derek O'Brien, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, Prasun Banerjee and Manoj Tiwary. ""The party is scouting for fresh faces for the upcoming election in Goa... As far as the Trinamool is concerned, we would like to give 40 clean new faces,"" he said to a query on whether the party would consider those MLAs, who have defected from one party to another. When asked if the Trinamool plans to forge an alliance, he said, ""We are going to go all alone."" It is possible for the Trinamool to win the upcoming elections in Goa although the time left for the polls was very short, he added. The elections are due in February. Mr Faleiro slammed the Congress saying that the party never wanted to form a government in Goa and therefore it did not stake a claim for it despite emerging as the single largest party after the 2017 elections. He said that I-PAC has been conducting a survey in Goa, the results of which would be available in the next 10-15 days, after which the detailed roadmap for elections in Goa would be prepared. He said the Trinamool would release a ""charge sheet"" against the BJP government in Goa, which would expose its ""misdeeds"".   In the last Assembly polls, the Congress had won the highest number of 17 seats, restricting the BJP to 13 seats. However, surprising the Congress, the BJP allied with regional parties and formed the government under the leadership of senior leader Manohar Parrikar. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has already thrown its hat in the ring ahead of the polls, with the party's national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announcing free power up to 300 units per month and 80 per cent jobs for locals if his party is voted to power during his recent visit to Panaji."

However, the power bill for consumers may increase marginally from October 1 as the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has raised the pension surcharge from 5 per cent to 7 per cent. ""After considering all the relevant factors, the Commission has come to the conclusion that there are no good reasons to make any increase in the existing tariff structure,'' the DERC said in a statement. Last fiscal also (2020-21) also, the DERC did not hike electricity rates citing the Covid pandemic. In the new power tariff order, the DERC has encouraged green power by providing waiver of Service Line cum Development (SLD) and Network Augmentation charges for all renewable energy projects to developers under the Virtual & Group Net Metering mode. In order to promote pollution-free transportation and clean environment, the commission has decided to continue with the existing subsidised tariff rates for e vehicles. It has also kept the levy of Regulatory Asset Surcharge of 8 percent unchanged in 2021-22. The surcharge is levied on the consumers of power discoms in Delhi. The power tariff in Delhi has not witnessed any major increase since the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in 2015. Ruling party leaders claim the electricity rates in the city are ""cheapest"" in the country.   Delhi''s power discoms - BRPL, BYPL and TPDDL - in their petitions to the DERC before the tariff revision had demanded a hike, citing losses due to COVID-19.

""All the Principal District & Sessions Judges and Principal Judge, Family Court shall prepare a roster of judicial officers of their respective districts in such a manner that w.e.f. 04.10.2021, on any given day, around 3/4th of the total strength of judicial officers hold the court physically while the others hold the court through virtual mode. The aforesaid arrangement shall continue up to 30.10.2021,"" said the office order issued for district courts. Last month, the high court had announced that it would start physical hearings in a restricted manner from August 31, following which two division benches and 10 single-judge benches conducted proceedings physically and the remaining benches continued to take up matters through video conferencing. The order permitted the high court to have hybrid/video conferencing hearings on physical hearing dates. The Principal District & Sessions Judges and Principal Judge, Family Court was directed by the high court to prepare the roster of judicial officers in such a manner that every judicial officer holds physical court on alternate days while the others continue to hold courts through video-conferencing, as per the existing arrangement.   Since March 2020, the high court has been holding proceedings through video conferencing following the outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequently, few benches had started holding physical courts every day on a rotation basis. While the high court had resumed complete physical hearing from March 15, 2021, it had decided on April 8 that from April 9, it would take up matters through virtual mode only because of the rise in COVID-19 cases during the second wave."

The incident took place late on Tuesday night in Arniya village that falls under Atru police station. The girl's body was handed over to her family after postmortem Wednesday and a case of murder was lodged against her father, Pawan Sahariya, who had been detained for interrogation on Tuesday, they said. However, during the initial investigation on Wednesday, it was found that the girl fell from her mother's arms during the fight between the couple, senior police official (DSP) Sheojiram Jat said. Earlier this week, Sahariya's wife left his home and went to her father's place in Nahargarh after a fight while their two-year-old son and six-months-old daughter, Arushi, were living with the father, Mr Jat said. The woman went back on Tuesday evening to get the children when another fight erupted between the couple. Sahariya grabbed Arushi from her mother's arms and threw her on the floor, the officer said, adding the minor sustained fatal injury on her head and died on the spot.   The case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was lodged against Sahariya on the complaint received from his wife.

Talking to reporters during a press conference, Mr Faleiro also said that Mamata Banerjee will visit the state once the ongoing 15-day 'pitru paksh' period, considered inauspicious for launching any new projects, is over. Luizinho Faleiro joined the TMC on Wednesday in Kolkata along with nine other leaders. He addressed the press conference in Panaji in the presence of senior TMC leaders, including Derek O'Brien, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, Prasun Banerjee and Manoj Tiwary. ""The party is scouting for fresh faces for the upcoming election in Goa... As far as the TMC is concerned, we would like to give 40 clean new faces,"" he said in response to a query on whether the party would consider MLAs who have defected to another party. When asked if the TMC plans to forge an alliance, he said, ""We are going to go all alone."" It is possible for the TMC to win the upcoming elections in Goa although the time left for the polls is very short, he added. The elections are due in February. Mr Faleiro attacked the Congress saying that the party never wanted to form a government in Goa and therefore it did not stake a claim despite emerging as the single largest party after the 2017 elections. He said that I-PAC (Indian Political Action Committee) has been conducting a survey in Goa, the results of which will be available in the next 10-15 days. The detailed roadmap for the elections in Goa will be prepared after the result is out. He said the TMC will release a ""charge sheet"" against the BJP government in Goa, which will expose its ""misdeeds"".   In the last Assembly polls, the Congress had won the highest number of 17 seats, restricting the BJP to 13 seats. However, surprising the Congress, the BJP allied with regional parties and formed the government under the leadership of senior leader Manohar Parrikar. The AAP has already thrown its hat in the ring ahead of the polls, with the party's national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, during his recent visit to Panaji, announcing free power of up to 300 units per month and 80% jobs for locals if his party is voted to power."

Special judge M K Nagpal, however, directed to frame charges against one of Chauhan's associates, Ramesh Bhardwaj, saying there was sufficient prima facie evidence to hold him responsible. Bhardwaj was also accused in a sexual harassment case filed by the woman. According to the complaint, the main accused Bhardwaj was a close associate of Chauhan and, therefore, the politician always protected and sheltered him in the sexual harassment incident. The judge held that simply because Chauhan was the local MLA and Bhardwaj, or any other accused was close to him, cannot be considered as an incriminating circumstance against him to hold him prima facie responsible for the offence of abetment of suicide by the woman, either in pursuance of the said criminal conspiracy or individually. Regarding Bhardwaj, the court held that there was sufficient prima facie evidence to hold him responsible for the suicide as the documents and material on record suggesting that the suicide was abetted by him which was punishable under section 306 IPC. It further said, ""This court is of the considered opinion that there is no prima facie evidence or material on record to show the existence of any criminal conspiracy between Bhardwaj and all the other accused persons for abetting the commission of suicide by deceased."" Those others discharged were Mohan Lal Verma, Sanjay, Amit Bhardwaj, Rajnikant, and Mukhtiyar Singh. According to the prosecution, the woman had consumed a poisonous substance at her home in North-West Delhi's Narela and died during treatment at LNJP Hospital. The woman had filed a complaint against Bhardwaj for alleged sexual harassment a month before committing suicide, after which he was arrested and later released on bail. The family members of the woman had claimed that she had gone into depression after Bhardwaj was released on bail. She had also alleged that the accused was being protected by Chauhan, an MLA from Nangloi. The woman in a video recording had also levelled serious allegations against Bhardwaj, accusing him of pressuring her to ""compromise"" if she wanted to rise in the party and claimed himself to be ""close to the local party MLA"", the prosecution had claimed. If convicted, Bhardwaj may get a maximum 10-year jail term.     (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)  "

It also said that increased population density raises chances of COVID-19 spread and it will be prudent to avoid non-essential travel and observe festivity at low key. The government said that 64.1 per cent doses of COVID-19 vaccine has been administered in vaccination centres in rural areas and 35 per cent in urban areas. A total of 67.4 lakh doses (approximately 0.88 pc) have been administered at vaccination centres not tagged as rural/urban, it said. It said that 59.66 per cent of the total COVID-19 cases last week were reported from Kerala and the state has over one lakh active cases. The government also stressed that the number of COVID-19 tests has not reduced and 15 to 16 lakh tests are being done every day in the country. Eighteen districts are reporting weekly Covid positivity rate between five to ten per cent and 30 districts are reporting over 10 per cent weekly positivity rate, it said. On the Zydus Cadila's COVID-19 vaccine, the government said that ZyCoV-D is a three-dose needle-free vaccine and it will be priced differently than jabs being used currently.   Talks are being held with the manufacturer on its pricing, it said.

MLAs In Delhi","The Congress, which is firefighting in Punjab, may soon have another conflagration on its hands in Chhattisgarh -- one of the few states it still rules. Around 20 MLAs from the state have been camping in Delhi since yesterday, ostensibly to seek more time from Rahul Gandhi for his coming visit to Bastar. But the visit -- coming in the backdrop of a rift within two factions of the state Congress over the Central leadership apparent promise for a rotation in the Chief Minister's post -- has triggered speculation about the party heading for a crisis in the state. The delegation which reached Delhi are all loyalists of the Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, who may lose the post if the Central leadership implements the rotational system, which the TS Singh Deo camp claims was the promise after the 2018 state elections when the party came to power in the state dislodging the BJP. Sources indicate that after the tumult in Punjab -- where the party's tallest leader in the state, Amarinder Singh stepped down from the Chief Minister's post as the Gandhis backed newcomer Navjot Singh Sidhu -- the visit could be a tactic to exert pressure on them to back the Chief Minister. Brihaspat Singh, the MLA from Sarguja who is part of the delegation, told NDTV that they are waiting to meet the party's central leadership. ""Fifteen or 16 MLAs have come here. There is a plan for Rahul Gandhi to visit the state for a function. He had accepted our invitation and we want him to allot some more time for this visit,"" said Mr Singh. ""We are yet to meet Punia ji (Congress in-charge of the state PL Punia). We were tired yesterday and rested. We will meet him soon,"" added the MLA, whose group had reached the national capital yesterday. Asked about reports that the group has come to officially back the Chief Minister with letters of support, he said, ""This is not required. The last time we came here, we had informed PL Punia about our support both verbally and in writing. The situation in Chhattisgarh is not the same as in Punjab. No such thing is happening in Chhattisgarh"". In Raipur, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said questioned why the MLAs cannot go anywhere without raising speculation. ""If someone has gone there, it shouldn't be seen from a political angle. If a politician is going somewhere, it is obvious that he'll meet political persons only. PL Punia isn't in Delhi, how can anyone meet him there?"" he added.   The demand for a change of guard in the state came as the government completed two-and-a-half years in June. The TS Singh Deo camp claimed that it was his turn at the top post in view of the Central leadership's assurance. Mr Punia has repeatedly denied that any such promise was made. In August, the Central leaders had summoned both Mr Baghel and Mr Singh Deo to Delhi to resolve the feud. At the time, 54 of the state's 70 Congress MLAs had visited Delhi in a show of strength. But the situation still appears unresolved."

He succeeded Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria following his retirement. ""Protection of our nation's sovereignty and integrity is to be ensured at any cost,"" the new IAF Chief said. Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari added that enhancement of operational capability through integration of newly inducted platforms, weapons and equipment with existing assets and dovetailing the same in the concepts of operations would remain a priority area. In a brief address to the IAF personnel, he also spoke on acquisition of new technology, promotion of indigenisation and innovation, strengthening of cyber security and need for adopting new training methods to deal with future security challenges. The Chief of Air Staff also urged the IAF personnel to ""always uphold the ethos and credo of the ""Air Warrior"" and strive to be an asset"" to force in any role tasked for. Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari was serving as Vice Chief of the Air Staff before assuming the new role. Before becoming Vice Chief of the IAF, he was serving as commander-in-chief of the IAF's Western Air Command (WAC) that looks after the security of India air space in the sensitive Ladakh sector as well as various other parts of north India. An alumnus of the National Defence Academy, Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari was commissioned into the fighter stream of the IAF on December 29, 1982. In a distinguished career spanning nearly 38 years, the officer has flown a wide variety of fighter and trainer aircraft in the inventory of IAF. He has a flying experience of more than 3,800 hours, including operational flying on MiG-21, MiG-23 MF, MiG 29 and Su-30 MKI fighter jets. Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari held numerous important positions. He was the commanding officer of a frontline fighter squadron and has also commanded a frontline fighter base. Apart from various operational issues, Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari will have to also address matters related to the ambitious theaterisation model of the armed forces. The theatre commands are being planned to integrate the capabilities of the three services and to ensure optimal utilisation of their resources. The theatre commands are being set up under a larger mandate of ensuring synergy among the three service chiefs to deal with future security challenges. Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat has been focusing on bringing convergence among the three services and restructuring military commands to effectively deal with future security challenges.   There has been a growing perception that the Indian Air Force has some reservations about the theaterisation programme.

Replying to a reporter's question on any possibility of Navjot Singh Sidhu, who recently resigned as the Punjab Congress chief, joining the AAP, he said, ""It is a hypothetical question. If such a thing happens, we will let you know."" Mr Kejriwal also referred to Bhagwant Mann, the chief of the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) Punjab unit, as his younger brother. Mr Mann is said to be an aspirant for the party's chief ministerial face in the Punjab polls, slated to be held early next year. When a reporter said Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi is presenting himself as an ""aam aadmi"" (common man), Mr Kejriwal said, ""It is easy to copy Kejriwal but it is difficult to implement."" ""When for the first time, my government was formed for 49 days, I had sent 32 officers involved in corruption to jail.... There are accusations that corrupt and tainted officers are being given big posts (in Punjab). ""Today, allegations are levelled that there are members in Channi's council of ministers who are tainted... I want to tell him that besides copying Kejriwal, he should have the courage to take action,"" he added. The Delhi chief minister said people did not join his party for any post. ""All of them have come for (serving) the society and the country,"" he said at a press conference here on the concluding day of his two-day Punjab visit. Mr Kejriwal pointed out that he has repeatedly said ""when the time comes, we will give you a good chief ministerial face"". ""He could be anyone. Presently, we are not thinking about it,"" he added. During his visit to Amritsar in June, the AAP convenor had announced that the party's chief ministerial face for the Punjab polls will be from the Sikh community. However, he had not named anyone. Citing certain media reports on Mr Mann, who is said to be an aspirant for the AAP's chief ministerial face in Punjab, Mr Kejriwal referred to him as his younger brother. ""What you keep publishing in the newspapers, there is nothing like that,"" he said, in an apparent reference to media reports on Mr Mann sulking over the party not announcing his name as its chief ministerial candidate. With Mr Mann, a comedian-turned-politician, seated next to him, Mr Kejriwal said there was a time when the Sangrur MP used to earn lakhs of rupees from his entertainment shows. ""He left everything for Punjab. At that time, he did not join the AAP.... He has made sacrifices for Punjab,"" he said. The supporters of Mr Mann have been demanding that the party leadership declare him as its chief ministerial candidate. To another question on AAP leaders' reported statements that farmers in Punjab should be penalised for stubble-burning, which causes pollution in Delhi, Mr Kejriwal said, ""Who said this? None of our leaders has ever said this. You show me the statement that any AAP leader has said this, I will quit politics. But do not spread lies...."" He then spelled out the steps taken by the Delhi government to curb stubble-burning. ""We gave a solution for stubble-burning. We have made a bio-decomposer. Farmers are in a hurry to sow the next crop, so they set stubble on fire. There is no fault of the farmers in this. It is the fault of the governments. What were they doing? Why did they not find solutions? But we do not indulge in the politics of blame game, we do the politics of finding solutions to problems,"" the Delhi chief minister said. He said his government has come up with a solution to convert stubble into manure, which if the AAP comes to power in Punjab, will also be implemented in the state. Mr Kejriwal targeted the Congress government in Punjab, saying while there is unemployment in the state, the promise of giving an unemployment allowance was not met.

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Pankaj Sharma directed Rujira to appear before the court physically on October 12, while granting her exemption from the personal appearance for the day. In her plea seeking exemption from personal appearance, Rujira told the court that she was unable to travel with her child on short notice. The court had directed Rujira to appear before it on September 30. Her plea was opposed by ED's Special Public Prosecutor Nitesh Rana, who told the court that she had to appear before the court physically and seek bail since she was accused of evading summons. The judge granted the exemption for the day after noting that Rujira appeared through the video conferencing and her advocate Siddharth Aggarwal, who appeared physically, assured that she will appear before the court in person on the next day of the hearing. In its complaint, the ED alleged that she refused to appear before the agency in New Delhi despite repeated summons issued to her. The couple had earlier approached the Delhi High Court seeking quashing of summons issued to them by the ED for questioning in a money laundering case linked to an alleged coal scam in West Bengal, saying they are residents of Kolkata and should not be compelled to join the probe in the national capital. The plea is currently pending before the high court, which is scheduled to further hear it on Friday. Abhishek Banerjee, nephew of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and his wife have challenged the September 10 summons and also sought to direct the ED not to summon them for their appearance in Delhi and thereby not compelling them to join the investigation in the instant case here. The 33-year-old MP represents the Diamond Harbour seat in Lok Sabha and is the national general secretary of the Trinamool Congress. The plea before the high court also said that a greater degree of protection is granted to a woman under Section 160 of the CrPC, which mandates that she shall not be required to attend any place other than where she resides. It claimed the repeated issuance of summons to Rujira Banerjee to appear before the ED was ex-facie illegal and mala fide and sought court's intervention before any coercive measures are resorted to by the agency. The ED lodged a case under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act on the basis of a November 2020 FIR registered by the CBI that alleged a multi-crore coal pilferage scam related to Eastern Coalfields Ltd mines in the state's Kunustoria and Kajora areas in and around Asansol. Local coal operative Anup Majhi alias Lala is alleged to be the prime suspect in the case. The ED had earlier claimed that Abhishek Banerjee was a beneficiary of funds obtained from this illegal trade. He has denied all charges. Abhishek Banerjee said ED has repeatedly summoned him and his wife for examination in person in Delhi without supplying a copy of the ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) and without specifying whether they are being summoned as witnesses or accused, nor indicating the scope of the investigation being carried out.   He said their examination may take place in Kolkata where ED has a functional and fully equipped zonal office.

""I am sure you are aware that raids were conducted by police at homes of several journalists in Kashmir earlier this month. Personal items such as electronic gadgets including phones and laptops were illegally seized along with ATM cards and passports of their spouses. This comes close on the heels of the harrowing experiences that the journalist community in Jammu and Kashmir has been subject to post the abrogation of Article 370 by the Indian government,"" Ms Mufti wrote. ""We have witnessed the manner in which fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and expression enshrined in the Indian constitution have increasingly come under attack especially in the last two years by a hostile and insecure dispensation,"" the letter said. The former Chief Minister alleged that the harassment of journalists has become a norm. She said that 23 journalists from Kashmir have been put on the ""Exit Control List"" or ECL which prevents them from leaving the country without clearance from the Home Ministry. ""Reportedly 23 journalists have been put on ECL. Even students who bag scholarships in prestigious colleges in top universities of the world are not allowed to go study there. Recently a student was deboarded from a plane, arrested and subsequently released,"" she said. ""In addition to this, a sizeable number of journalists are either threatened or charged with sections under UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act) or sedition law, simply because their reportage on J and K does not cater to the PR stunts of the ruling dispensation. Reporting truth to power is being criminalised with every passing day,"" read the letter. Many journalists in Kashmir have been alleging harassment and police cases on flimsy grounds. Earlier this month, the police raided the homes of four journalists and seized their documents, mobile phones, laptops and also ATM cards. After questioning them for few days, they were let go but their equipment including phones are still with the police. Several media watchdog groups have condemned the harassment of journalists in Kashmir.   The UN Special Rapporteur for protection of rights and freedom of expression also voiced serious concern over harassment of journalists in Kashmir. After the central government scrapped Jammu and Kashmir's special constitutional status and stripped it of its statehood, local journalists have been complaining of an iron curtain on information and frequent incidents of intimidation."

According to the police, the accused, 29-year-old Irfan Haider and his mother brought the girl to Mumbai from Bihar's Muzaffarpur two months ago to do domestic work for six people. The police recently received a video, in which the girl was seen cleaning the staircase and removing garbage from the man's two-storey house at Netaji Nagar in Mumbai's suburban Santacruz, the official told news agency Press Trust of India. ""After watching the video, we were shocked that a nine-year-old was made to work for a family of six people. We tried to contact the child's mother in Bihar, but couldn't get through to her,"" inspector Manoj Shinde from Vakola police station in Mumbai said. The official said Irfan Haider told the police that they had brought the girl from Bihar to do domestic work. The man's mother told the police that the girl's mother had willingly handed her over to them as the child's father was an alcoholic and would allegedly beat her up, he said. The girl was rescued on Wednesday night and sent to St Catherine children's home in suburban Andheri, he said, adding that a special team will be sent to Bihar to take her back to her family.   The police arrested Irfan Haider today under relevant sections of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, while his mother is wanted in the case, the official said.

Announcing the ""Clean India Campaign"", Anurag Thakur, Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, said the programme will begin tomorrow - the eve of Gandhi Jayanti. ""I urge all of you - self-help groups, clubs, organisations, individuals, and institutions - to join us from October 1 to 31 in this Clean India programme to make India free of plastic waste,"" Mr Thakur said.

A division bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar was hearing a habeas corpus (produce the person) petition filed by the husband seeking a direction to the actor to hand over the custody of their son to him. The court, while refusing to hand over the custody of the child, said there was no material, which prima facie indicates that the custody of the child with the mother was detrimental to his welfare and development. At such a tender age, a child needs the company of the mother, and hence, keeping him in her custody appears ""more natural and conducive for the development of the child"", the court noted. ""Ordinarily, the amount of love, affection, care and protection, which a mother can provide to a child of such tender age, cannot be expected to be provided by the father or any other person. This does not necessarily reflect upon the unsuitability of the father and other relations,"" the court said. The bench, however, noted that the child needs the love and affection of both parents, and hence, access should be given to the father. The court also directed the actor to allow daily access to the father, through video-conference for half an hour and physical access twice a week. ""We hope and trust that the petitioner (father) and respondent No 2 (the actor), who claim to be adept at playing characters, in reel life, act in the best interest of the child, in real life,"" the court said in its order. The actor's husband in his plea had claimed that she had illegally kept his son away from him. The petitioner's advocate Swapana Kode sought custody of the child to be handed over to the father claiming that he had quit acting to take care of the boy and that his estranged wife was unable to pay attention to the child's needs and well-being, as she was constantly busy with her professional commitments. The actor's advocate Hrishikesh Mundargi opposed the plea and argued that the child was happy with his mother and that it would be detrimental to his growth and well-being if his custody was handed over to the petitioner. The bench, in its order, noted that due to marital discord, the couple had developed a strong animosity towards each other and in such cases, where the parents are at loggerheads, the parameters for determination of proper custody of a child is well recognised. The bench refused to accept the petitioner's argument that his wife, being an extremely busy actor, was not in a position to devote time and effort towards the upbringing of their son.   ""In our view, the issue of welfare of the minor cannot be determined on the sole parametre of the work commitment of one parent and the availability of ample time with another. The fact that respondent No 2 is a busy actor, cannot be construed to unfavourably judge her suitability to have the custody of the child,"" the court said.

Separated by a glass screen, she sat just a few feet from Salah Abdeslam, suspected of being the lone surviving member of a commando of suicide bombers and gunmen who killed 130 people in a series of coordinated attacks on Paris in November, 2015. ""What's important is his aura and his eyes, those deep, round eyes,"" de Pourquery told Reuters in her studio. ""You have this gaze that is very deep, and very intense, which clearly shows a lot of fear. And that's what you need to recreate with the paintbrush."" When Abdeslam removed his black mask during the first day of the trial and defiantly declared himself to be a soldier of Islamic State, de Pourquery made rapid strokes with her watercolour brush. Close enough to see the slightest expression etched on Abdeslam's face, de Pourquery described the calculated demeanour of the 31-year-old who expressed no remorse for the violence that November night six years earlier. ""You could hear the tone of his voice. It was reasoned, thought through,"" de Pourquery continued. ""And it was bordering on icy."" Now three weeks into the trial, the artist and the defendant were each becoming accustomed to the presence of the other, with the French-Moroccan nodding at her at the start of each hearing, she said. De Pourquery said she had sketched 150 trials, including that of the Islamic terrorists who attacked the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in early 2015. The court sessions can last up to 10 hours each day, during which de Pourquery will sketch as many as seven drawings for TV news bulletins.   It can be gruelling, emotional work, hunched in the same position for hours, focused on the emerging sketch but wary of missing a brief moment that defines the day's hearing. ""It's good to switch off and paint something else, a pretty watercolour, the sea, the beach, something that has nothing to do with the trial,"" she said."

Or some of Whole Food's avocado ice cream with Bitcoin.  That's the goal of a new partnership between crypto payment processor BitPay Inc. and Verifone Inc., one of the world's largest providers of those little machines you use to pay via a credit card or Venmo at a checkout line. Later this year, the newest Verifone terminals will start accepting payments for U.S. merchants from a range of cryptocurrency wallets and tokens, the companies said in a statement Tuesday. Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed. Widespread use of tokens for purchases has been a goal that has long eluded the crypto industry, with most users focusing on speculation and merchants scared off by the price volatility of the digital assets. BitPay said it will provide greater protection from price swings since the funds will be settled promptly into the merchant's bank account in traditional currency once a transaction is completed.  BitPay already processes more than 60,000 transactions a month, more than half of them in Bitcoin, according to the company. By comparison, Visa Inc. handles an average of 150 million transactions a day. “We just want to give consumers options,” Mike Pulli, chief executive officer of Verifone, said in an interview. “If they decide to buy a pizza with Visa or AmEx or crypto, we don't care. We just want to give them the flexibility to pay the way they want to.” Today, spending crypto can be a headache: In the worst-case scenario, a customer may need to move coins to an exchange, sell them, then move money into a bank account to spend. Some people use their crypto money to buy gift cards. Others are signing up for debit cards offered by the likes of Coinbase Global Inc., which lets them use crypto anywhere Visa is accepted.  Verifone is the latest firm seeking to make crypto payments easier. Last week, social network Twitter allowed users to tip in Bitcoin. PayPal Holdings Inc. has also boosted its efforts in digital payments. Starbucks formed a partnership in 2018 to created a venture designed to more tightly integrate digital currencies into global commerce. Merchants are lining up for the product, Pulli said. “There's a very nice backlog of them,” he said. “There's lots and lots and lots of interest. I think our phones will be ringing off the hook” once the capability is more widely known of.  While the companies didn't say which merchants will be included, some brands that Verifone works with already include American Eagle Outfitters, Macy's, Williams Sonoma, Taco Bell and Whole Foods.     
Verifone and Atlanta-based BitPay didn't disclose how long their exclusive partnership will last. Verifone has an option to invest in BitPay as well, the company said. BitPay has raised more than $70 million in funding from investors including Founders Fund and Virgin Group.  Verifone, which was taken private by Francisco Partners in 2018, is not planning to go public again any time soon, Pulli said.   “We've always felt it was a matter of time before people had an expectation they could pay with crypto as they pay with Mastercard and Visa,” Stephen Pair, CEO of BitPay, said in an interview. “This development will accelerate that. Consumers are going to just expect that to be an option.” (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

He said Quad comprising India, Australia, the US and Japan, is not an alliance and it is a practical partnership of like-minded democracies and economies coming together to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific and deal with some of the world's biggest challenges. When asked about ways to balancing the relationship between India and China in the backdrop of Beijing's recent comments that the Quad is meant to counter its influence in the Indo-Pacific, Morrison said he does not see the region in such ""binary terms"". ""I don't think India and Australia consider it as something that needs to be balanced in relation to China. That's not the objective. Our objective working together is to ensure that we promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, and everybody who wants to participate in that, including China, is a welcome partner in that cause,"" he said. The Australian prime minister was speaking at an online media briefing that came six days after the first in-person summit of the Quad in Washington that was hosted by US President Joe Biden and attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Morrison and outgoing Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga. ""We don't really want to see the region in such binary terms. That's not how the Quad is approaching the challenges that we see in the region,"" he said, according to the transcript of the briefing released by his office. ""Of course, we want to deter any type of behaviour that threatens peace and security in the region, that threatens the development and prosperity of countries in the region, or in any way seeks to limit their sovereignty or what their access to the freedoms that exist under international law,"" he said. On AUKUS (Australia, the UK and the US) pact that will facilitate Australia getting technology to build nuclear-powered submarines, Morrison said it will complement partnerships like the Quad rather than taking away anything from them. ""There was a very warm embrace of the AUKUS announcement by our Quad partners. Narendra (Modi) and Yoshi (Japanese PM) totally understood and supported what we were seeking to achieve there. And they totally were positive about how it complemented the Quad,"" Morrison said. The alliance, increasingly seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the South China Sea, was announced by US President Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and PM Morrison two weeks back. France reacted angrily to the formation of the new alliance as it resulted in Paris effectively losing a multi-billion dollar deal to build 12 conventional submarines for Australia. France is also upset over its exclusion from the alliance. He said Australia has direct bilateral partnerships with the US and the UK and they are its formal allies. ""So what was great in the Quad when I spoke to both prime ministers before the announcement, the day before, they were pretty much there at hello. They totally understood it, understand its strategic significance, the direction, how it was going to help and add to what we're all doing,"" Morrison said. ""And I thought that was very positive. I think that just showed the instinctive nature of that Quad partnership. We sort of all know where we're each going and how we're operating. And so we're quite synchronised,"" he said. The Australian PM said that one of the goals that India and Australia and Japan have is to continue to encourage the US and Europe for greater economic engagement within the Indo-Pacific. He said the Quad is also going deeper into critical and emerging technologies, particularly in rare earth, and the supply chain for rare earth and critical minerals.   ""The manufacturing capabilities that exist within India, combined with the resource strengths of Australia in this field, provide a natural partnership,"" he said. ""And when you link that with the advanced economies in the US and Japan, it is a natural, a very natural partnership that is seeking to create more secure, more reliable, and more competitive supply chains in the rare earths space, through to end-user products,"" he added."

Airtel Business chief executive Ajay Chitkara said its Nxtra unit will make the investment by 2025, with plans to build a data centre economy across 80 Indian cities, adding that the move will triple its installed capacity to more than 400 MW. ""There is a huge potential and huge demand (for data centres) which is expected in the next three to four years' time,"" Mr Chitkara told a virtual news conference. Nxtra currently runs 10 large and 120 edge data centres, or smaller data processing facilities, across India and the expansion is part of a strategy by telcos to add new revenue streams to their business and lure enterprise clients who typically offer higher margins. The business plan also comes at a time when traditional voice services face new competition from free calls on apps such as Facebook's WhatsApp and Signal. An affiliate of US private equity group Carlyle last year bought a 25% stake in Nxtra. Airtel still owns 75%. Public cloud spending in India is expected to exceed $12 billion by 2025, Naveen Mishra of research firm Gartner said. Airtel's rival Reliance Jio, which is controlled by Mukesh Ambani, forged an alliance with Microsoft in 2019 to build data centres across India and this year partnered with Google to boost its enterprise and consumer offerings as it plans to launch 5G services. Separately, Airtel said Nxtra will increase the use of green energy for its data centres, aiming to source 50% of its power requirements from renewable sources.

While Fumio Kishida's first post as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party got a little over 30,000 likes, a picture of his dinner on Wednesday garnered more than four times as many clicks. “When I got home, my wife Yuko made me okonomiyaki, because I had said I love the dish she makes for me on Instagram live,” Kishida tweeted. “It's always super delicious, but today it was so delicious I won't forget it for a lifetime. Thank you.” For those not familiar with okonomiyaki, it's a savory pancake filled with cabbage that's cooked on a griddle, with various extras like meat and fish and topped with sauce. A variation of the dish is a regional specialty in Osaka and is considered a soul food for Hiroshima, Kishida's constituency. He is by no means a prominent voice among politicians on Twitter, with just around 180,000 followers. That's a long way behind the 2.4 million followers of Taro Kono, the avid Twitter and Instagram user he beat to the top job.   Kishida will have to tread carefully as he learns how to operate social media platforms. An Instagram photo of his wife cooking him dinner during last year's LDP leadership election, when he lost to outgoing prime minister Yoshihide Suga, was met with a backlash for coming across as sexist.

Some people are interested in quickly creating wealth by directly trading in the popular, and sometimes high-yield, coins, while others are creating ways to accept them as payments at restaurants and online shops. There are also some who may have gained cryptocurrency through mining. However, there is some confusion about how the government may tax these incomes or how an individual or institution should declare them. The move by authorities to first ban and then allow trading in virtual coins has only added to the confusion. In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India banned banks and other financial institutions from facilitating transactions in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and others. Later, in early 2020, the Supreme Court reversed the order, allowing trading of these virtual coins. Still, they have not yet received the status of a legal tender in India. The RBI has said it is working on its own cryptocurrency and will proceed with caution, keeping in mind the disruption this new form of currency may cause to the existing financial order.  Despite all that, you will have to pay taxes on these incomes. The confusion is whether to declare them as capital gains or in any other source. The government plans to compartmentalize virtual currencies and their tax based on their use, be it investments, payments, or utility. The government has already made it mandatory for companies dealing with virtual currencies to disclose profit or loss incurred on transactions. It also asked them to disclose the amount of cryptocurrency they hold in their balance sheets. But this has not yet brought the taxability laws to govern their transactions. Still, the income tax laws have always sought to tax income received irrespective of how it was received. So there are primarily four scenarios of income from cryptocurrency. 1.Mining Mined cryptocurrencies are self-generated capital assets. Subsequent sale of such bitcoins would usually give rise to capital gains. 2. Transferred in exchange for real currency  The appreciation in the value of cryptocurrency held as an investment may classify as a long-term capital gain or a short-term capital gain depending on how long the asset has been held. 3.  Income from trading activity  The income from trading crypto coins would constitute income from business and hence the profit can be taxed as applicable tax slabs.   4. Received on sale of goods and services  These cryptocurrency gains can be treated on a par with receipt of money. So the recipient would be taxed under the head profits or gains from business or profession."

He also sought the Union government's support to revive drug-manufacturing company RDPL, which was a joint venture of the Centre and the state. Talking about the challenges in service delivery, Mr Gehlot said due to distances, the service delivery cost, be it in the health or in the education sector, from district to district and village to village is high in Rajasthan as compared to other states.   He also said 30 of the 33 districts in the state will have medical colleges by 2023. Fifteen medical colleges are already there and 15 more will be ready by 2023, the Chief Minister said.

Jailed gangster Jitendra Gogi and his two assailants posing as lawyers were killed inside the Rohini courtroom on September 24 in a dramatic shootout that also saw the police fire bullets in retaliation, the officials had said. Video footage of the incident showed policemen and lawyers rushing out in panic as gunshots rang out inside courtroom number 207. The two gunmen dressed as lawyers are suspected to be members of rival Tillu gang, an official had said, adding that over 30 shots were fired. On September 24, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana had expressed deep concern over the shootout inside the crowded Rohini courtroom and spoke to the Delhi High Court Chief Justice in this regard and advised him to talk to both police and the Bar to ensure that the functioning of the court is not affected.   The matter would be heard next on October 5.

AAP, he said, is on the rise in the state, fuelled by the decline of the Congress and this, he said, has been the findings of a recent survey by his own party. The survey -- done by the Congress between July and September -- shows that it has ""seen a 20% decline"", said the former Chief Minister. ""This election will be very different with the Congress, AAP, Akali Dal, factions of the Akali Dal, and there may be another front emerging too... so, it will be a very different election,"" Mr Singh told NDTV in an exclusive interview. Mr Singh, who has confessed to being ""humiliated"" by the Congress leadership thrice in his face-off with arch-rival Navjot Singh Sidhu, also said he would not be staying with the party any longer. But neither would he migrate to the BJP, he added, dismissing speculation about the matter triggered by his meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah yesterday. The year-long feud most of which was carried out publicly, is seen to have lowered the party's chances of a second term, even though the section of MLAs opposing Mr Singh had put it down to his government's lack of performance. AAP -- which has been targeting neighbouring Punjab since its stupendous victory in Delhi in 2015 -- has not been able to make sufficient headway in the state in elections so far. While in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, it won four of the state's 13 seats, its performance in the 2017 state elections fell short of target despite a massive initial surge of support. The party could only win 20 of the 117 assembly seats with a 23.8 per cent vote share. This time, Arvind Kejriwal, who has been making regular visits to the state, has again applied the Delhi formula, promising the state free power and water.   Today, he followed up those initial promises with another eight on healthcare -- which includes free treatment, mohalla clinics and upgraded infrastructure in government hospitals.   But the party's failure to project a face for the top post so far is seen as a serious drawback."

In a chaotic week where fights broke out at gas stations and people filled up old water bottles with gasoline, British ministers have repeatedly said the crisis is easing though they ordered soldiers on Wednesday to start driving fuel tankers. ""That crisis is now absolutely something which is back under control,"" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said. Reuters reporters visited seven petrol stations in London and surrounding areas on Thursday. Two were open. A line of dozens of drivers snaked back from one of the open stations with staff attempting to direct the queue. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents independent retailers who account for about two-thirds of all the 8,380 UK filling stations, said on Wednesday that 27% of members reported being out of fuel and it expected the situation to further improve in the next 24 hours. The gas station crisis has provoked scorn in some other European capitals with senior politicians suggesting that the trucker shortage was a clear consequence of the 2016 referendum decision to leave the European Union. British ministers have repeatedly denied Brexit played a role, though tens of thousands of EU truckers left during the Brexit maelstrom, and have cited the COVID lockdowns which prevented tens of thousands of trucker tests. Asked if Britain would be in a better position had it not left the single market, Clarke said: ""I really don't accept that."" ""The idea that this is about Brexit is to try and take us back into what is really I'm afraid quite a negative conversation around opportunities foregone,"" he said.   ""If you look at the situation in Germany, if you look at the situation in Poland, if you look at the situation in France, they share these problems too,"" he said.

In addition to this, the commission has also directed its investigation division to conduct an on-the-spot inquiry into the case. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in a statement said that it has directed the Etah senior superintendent of police (SSP) to have the allegations probed by a senior-rank police officer and submit an action taken report to the commission within four weeks. The rights panel said it has ""taken cognisance of a complaint, accompanied by a news clipping, that a 15-year-old minor boy, unable to bear the torture of being sent to a jail as an adult, on charges of drug possession, committed suicide, when released on bail after three months in Etah, Uttar Pradesh, on September 21, 2021"". It said that allegedly, the boy was arrested by the Etah police in connection with ""drug possession"" and was sent to the district jail, instead of being produced him before a Juvenile Justice Board. The boy's father has reportedly alleged that his son was ""illegally arrested and tortured to extort money by the police,"" it said. The NHRC has directed the SSP to have the allegations inquired into, keeping in mind some points, including what protocol is being followed for assessing the age and date of birth of the accused by police. It said that according to Rule 7 and Section 94 (c) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act (JJ Act), date of birth is the primary proof of age. Therefore, under what circumstances, the juvenile was treated as an adult, the panel has asked the police. Non-consideration of the matriculation certificate as proof of the date of birth is in violation of the judgment in the matter of ""Ashwani Kumar Saxena vs. State of MP (2012) 9 SCC 750"". Therefore, under what circumstances this was ignored, it said. The commission has directed its investigation division to conduct an on-the-spot inquiry, analyse the case and suggest institutional measures, which can be recommended to the government to ensure children are not being treated as adult for prosecution, the statement said.   The investigation division has also been directed to look into the role played by all stakeholders in this case, including the judge, before whom the child was produced within 24 hours of arrest, and the role of the doctor who examined the child, it added. Thus, inquiry report is to be submitted within six weeks, the rights panel said."

He also said the gap in medical education and delivery of health services is being reduced and that the government's focus is on preventive healthcare as well as promoting ayurveda and yoga. In six years, more than 170 medical colleges have been completed and work on over 100 new medical colleges is going on at a fast pace, PM Modi said at a virtual ceremony to mark the foundation stone laying of four medical colleges and inauguration of the Institute of Petrochemicals Technology in Rajasthan. ""The Centre is making efforts that there should be one medical college or institution for PG (post-graduate) medical education in every district,"" he said. Talking about the erstwhile Medical Council of India (MCI), he said that questions used to be raised on its decisions and there were allegations on its transparency. These had an adverse impact on quality of medical education and delivery of health services, the Prime Minister said. He said after efforts and many challenges, the government was finally able to bring reform by forming the National Medical Commission in place of the MCI. The impact of the commission is now visible, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said. PM Modi said when he became Chief Minister of Gujarat 20 years ago, there were many challenges in the areas of medical infrastructure, medical education and treatment facilities, but he accepted the challenges and tried to change the situation with collective efforts. He said the shortcomings in the health sector, which he felt as a chief minister, are now being removed in the country. The Centre worked on a national approach and a new national policy to transform the health sector, PM Modi said. ""Health is a state subject and I know what difficulties are there, because I was also a chief minister. We worked on that. The problem here was that the health system was divided and there was a lack connectivity and collective approach at the national level,"" he said. ""There was also a gap in traditional and modern medicine systems, and the shortcomings in governance also needed to be removed. Therefore, we started working on a new national health policy,"" he said. The Prime Minister said that from Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to Ayushman Bharat and now, Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, many such efforts are being made. Stressing on the need to spread the network of healthcare facilities across the country, he said be it AIIMS or medical colleges it is very important to spread their network rapidly to every nook and corner of the country. ""Today we can say with satisfaction that India is moving from six AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) to a strong network of more than 22 AIIMS,"" he said. In 2014, the total seats for under-graduate and post-graduate medical studies in the country was close to 82,000, which has now increased to 1.40 lakh, PM Modi said. ""The success of the central government's free (COVID-19) vaccine campaign for all is a reflection of its efforts. Today, more than 88 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in India,"" he said. Highlighting the significance of skilled manpower for the petrochemical sector, he said that a high level of skill will not only increase the strength of India but will also play a big role in realising the resolve of a self-reliant India. ""Skilled manpower is the need of the day for one of the fastest growing petrochemical sector,"" he said. On COVID-19, PM Modi said that the biggest pandemic in 100 years has taught a lot to the health sector of the world and India has resolved to increase its capacity of self-reliance in this disaster. Prior to the address, PM Modi virtually laid the foundation stones of medical colleges of Banswara, Sirohi, Hanumangarh and Dausa and inaugurated the Central Institute of Petrochemicals Engineering and Technology's Institute of Petrochemicals Technology (IPT) in Sitapura, Jaipur by pressing a button on a remote. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla also addressed the function virtually while Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya was present in the function held at CIPET in Jaipur.   Union ministers Gajendra Shekhawat, Bhupendra Yadav, Kailash Chaudhary, Arjun Meghwal, former chief minister Vasundhara Raje, Jaipur MP Ramcharan Bohra and others also attended the programme through video conference.

It was the second guilty verdict this year for Sarkozy, who led France from 2007 to 2012 and retains influence among conservatives despite falling from grace over his legal woes. The court was yet to say what sentence he would receive. Prosecutors were seeking a one-year prison sentence, half of it suspended, for the 66-year old former president. He is in any case unlikely to go to jail immediately as he would be expected to appeal the sentence. His conservative party, the prosecutors said, spent nearly double the 22.5 million euros (currently $19.2 million) allowed under electoral law on extravagant campaign rallies and then hired a friendly public relations agency to hide the cost. Sarkozy has denied wrongdoing. He told the court in June that he had not been involved in the logistics of his campaign for a second term as president nor in how money was spent during the election run-up. But the court said that Sarkozy was made aware of the overspending, that he did not act on it, and that it was not necessary for him to approve each individual spending to be responsible. Sarkozy was found guilty in a separate trial in March of trying to bribe a judge and peddle influence in order to obtain confidential information on a judicial inquiry. He also denied any wrongdoing in that case.   The former president was sentenced to three years in jail in that trial - two of which were suspended - but has not actually spent time in prison yet, while his appeal is pending.

Shortly after, the party's name was dropped from his Twitter bio. While the announcement came in an exclusive NDTV interview, a day after his meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah that had triggered speculation about him joining the BJP, the veteran politician today clarified: ""I have not resigned from the Congress but I will resign. I am not a person who takes split-second decisions. But I am not joining the BJP."" Soon after his remarks, a change in his Twitter bio followed. ""Army Veteran. Former Chief Minister of Punjab. Continuing to Serve the State (sic)."" it read. At a time when a political spectacle was needed to win public support, the infighting in Punjab has subjected the Congress to criticism from rivals as well as its own leaders.  Even as Navjot Singh Sidhu suggested a thaw two days after resigning as the Punjab Congress chief, Amarinder Singh's remarks are going to increase the party's troubles in the state where elections are due early next year. The 'Captain', as Amarinder Singh is sometimes referred to, today yet again said he felt insulted as the party failed to plug the crisis.  ""I have been in politics for 52 years. I have my own beliefs, my own principles. The way I have been treated. At 10.30 am the Congress President says you resign. I didn't ask any questions. I said I will do it just now. At 4 pm I went to the Governor and resigned. If you doubt me after 50 years and my credibility is at stake. If there is no trust, what is the point of me staying in the party?"" he told NDTV, recalling the events on the day of his shock exit.    After he had quit as the Chief Minister, he had told Sonia Gandhi he felt ""anguished at (the) political events of (the) last five months"".  ""I was humiliated three times by Congress leadership in the past two months...they called MLAs to Delhi twice and convened CLP today (Saturday)... they do not have confidence in me... now up to them to appoint anyone they trust,"" he said."

Details have not yet been confirmed, but the couple will opt out of a one-off payment of a million dollars to which the princess is entitled upon giving up her royal status, broadcaster NHK has said. The engagement of the 29-year-old grand-daughter of then Emperor Akihito and former classmate Kei Komuro was announced in 2017. But the marriage was put off after reports of a financial dispute between Komuro's mother and her former fiance. The couple will register their marriage at a local government office, with records of the imperial family adjusted to reflect that Princess Mako has left it, the report added. The IHA, which has not made an official announcement on the marriage or on the one-off payment, has no comment, an agency spokesperson told Reuters on Thursday. The fiance, who is enrolled in a New York law school, flew into Tokyo on Monday for the first time in three years, wearing long hair tied in a pony tail, a style that stirred comment on mid-day television shows and from tabloids. The controversy over the marriage plan started when a tabloid reported claims by a former fiance of Komuro's mother that the mother and son had failed to repay a debt of about 35,000 dollars. Komuro has said his mother's former fiance provided the money as a gift, not a loan. The IHA postponed multiple engagement ceremonies following the scandal and has made no plans since to hold them. The issue gained momentum after the tabloid coverage grew into a national concern that spilled into broadsheet newspapers, said Akinori Takamori, an expert on the imperial family who is a lecturer at Kokugakuin University in the capital. It swelled further when members of the imperial family felt impelled to speak out and secure public understanding. ""Even the most minuscule details like his hair became fodder for day-time television,"" Takamori said, adding that he felt the extent of media coverage of Komuro's family life could even amount to ""a human rights violation"". A recent poll by the daily Mainichi showed 38% of respondents supported the marriage, while 35% opposed it, and 26% expressed no interest.   ""It's not desirable to have the people split over this matter when the imperial family should be a symbol of unity for the country,"" Takamori said.

The Supreme Court allowed the Centre to file a formal application to make farmer unions party to the plea seeking opening of road blockade at Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border at UP Gate in Delhi. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said, ""The redressal of problems can be through judicial forum, agitation or through Parliamentary debates. But how can the highways be blocked and this is happening perpetually. Where does this end?"" The Supreme Court was hearing a plea of a Noida resident Monicca Agrawaal, who has sought removal of blockade saying that earlier it took 20 minutes to reach Delhi and now it is taking over two hours and people of the area are facing hardships due to protests at the UP Gate on Delhi border. At the outset, the bench asked Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj what is the government doing in the matter. Mr Nataraj said that they had convened a meeting with the protesting farmers and details have been mentioned in the affidavit. The bench said, ""We may lay down a law but how to implement the law is your business. The court cannot implement it. It is the executive who has to implement it"". Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that it is the duty of the executive to implement it. The bench said, ""When we lay down the law, you will say it is encroachment and we trespassed into the domain of the executive. This has ramifications but there are also grievances which need to be addressed. This cannot be a perpetual problem"". Mr Mehta said that when it is invited then it will not be encroached upon. He said that at the highest level a three-member committee was formed to address the grievances but the farmers' representatives who were invited refused to join in the discussions. Mr Mehta said the court should allow the petitioner to make the farmers union party to the petition, so that later they don't say that they were not made parties in the matter. The bench told Mr Mehta that it is he who will have to move an application for making farmers representative party as the petitioner, a private individual may not know who their leaders are. ""If you feel that someone is to be made party, you will have to make a request. You move a formal application giving details about the steps taken to resolve their grievances and how the impleadment of representatives of farmers will help in the resolution of the dispute"", the bench said, while listing the plea for hearing on October 4. Mr Mehta said that they will file the application by Friday. On August 23, the Supreme Court had said that the Centre and Delhi's neighbouring states should find a solution to road blockades on the national capital's borders due to farmers' protest. It had told the Centre why the government can't find a solution to this problem as though farmers have the right to protest but at the designated places and due to the protests, inflow and outflow of traffic cannot be disrupted. The Supreme Court had said that this will have an impact on toll collection as well because vehicles will not be able to pass through due to the blockades. It had then ordered, ""Solution lies in the hands of the Union of India and the concerned state governments. They have to coordinate to find a solution that when a protest takes place, roads are not blocked and traffic is not disrupted to cause inconvenience to the common people"". The Solicitor General had said that if the court is willing to pass some orders then two farmers unions can be made parties and he can give their names. The Supreme Court had said that tomorrow another two unions will come forward and say they represent the farmers and this will go on. On March 26, the top court had issued notice to Uttar Pradesh and Haryana on the plea. The Uttar Pradesh government has said in its affidavit that continuous efforts are being made to remove the blockade at the Delhi-UP border and there at present about 141 tents and 31 'langars' around the area, and the protestors have installed a platform on the flyover from where the leaders give speeches, a media house has also been made below the flyover. Similarly, the Haryana government also told the Supreme Court that protesters staging 'dharna' at Singhu border have been camping on about 6 kilometres stretch of lanes of NH-44 since November 27, last year. The farmers are protesting against passage of three laws-Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020.   Initially, the protests started from Punjab in November last year and later spread to Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and some other parts of the country.

She said the IAF (Indian Air Force) doctors subjected her to the banned and intrusive two-finger test, the use of which has triggered widespread outrage in the past over violating the survivor's right to privacy. It is also believed to be unscientific. In her police complaint, the officer also alleged that she was questioned about her ""sexual history"". The woman, who had travelled to the Air Force College for training, said the assault took place inside her room at the Air Force Administrative College in Coimbatore's Redfields. The assault took place about two weeks ago and the officer said she was forced to go to the police because she was not satisfied with action taken by the IAF after her original complaint. Twice, she said, she was made to submit a withdrawal - of the complaint letter - in writing and another time, she was asked to sign a letter with changes made, which she refused to sign. In a statement, the Air Force said: ""The IAF is cooperating with the police investigation and is also conducting an internal inquiry. We cannot comment any further as the matter is subjudice."" The initial investigation was carried out by an all-women team from the city's Gandhipuram Police Station. A case of sexual assault under section 376 was registered. The accused officer, a 29-year-old Flight Lieutenant, had come from Chattisgarh for training at the Air Force Facility near Race Course, officials say.   He was arrested by the city police amid objection from his lawyer, who said that ""the Coimbatore Police don't have powers to arrest an Air Force officer"". He argued ""only military procedure ought to be followed"". The court had initially remanded the accused for two days. Coimbatore Commissioner of Police Deepak M Damor told NDTV, ""There is no provision in (the) law to transfer an FIR to the Air Force. Police will complete the investigation and file a report before the court."" The National Commission for Women (NCW) has said it has taken note of a report about the Air Force officer being subjected to two-finger test by Indian Air Force doctors.  NCW chief Rekha Sharma, the women's body said, has written to the Air Chief Marshal to look into the matter.

Upon his arrival at the Chandigarh Airport, he spoke to the media at length where he said, ""Whatever is happening in Punjab is very unfortunate. It has been reduced to ""tamasha"". People don't know where to go. The Punjab Chief Minister should fulfill the promises made by Captain Amarinder Singh and act against tainted ministers, MLAs, and officers. The mastermind behind the sacrilege incidents of 2015 should be booked. Only AAP can create a stable govt in Punjab."" Amid speculation that Bhagwat Mann could be CM face for the AAP, when asked to comment on who the CM face of Punjab will be, he very distinctly remarked, ""The CM candidate from Punjab will be someone of your own, someone you will feel proud of."" Upon arriving in Ludhiana, the Chief Minister was scheduled to meet traders and industrialists at the Park Plaza Hotel. Around 250 participated at the event amid tight security. At the meeting, the AAP supremo remarked, addressing the industry body, ""I am not here to seek your support to help my party, in fact, I am here with a proposal that you be my partner. You make the decisions, you run the government. We will help you implement them."" Citing that traders in the country have to go through a lot of hassle and adhere to ""gunda raj"", Mr Kejriwal said, ""What does a trader want? He wants peace. He wants law and order. Punjab is a border state. This state deserves peace and law and order.""   While making promises, a significant one he uttered was, ""Aap promises peace, law, and order in Punjab. AAP will stop inspector raj, gunda tax, dhamkibaaz system,"" reflecting on the issue of national security. Today, the second day of his visit, he will be addressing a press conference at 11 am amid what the party calls 'big announcements' expected. Will it be announcing a CM face? Will it be a joining of someone new to the party? No one knows, except giving rise to one question - in the Punjab leadership crisis that only seems to be mounting, will the main opposition - the AAP cash in? With AAP benefit from this?

Mr Sidhu's aide had hinted at a climb down in the morning as he said the cricketer-turned-politician ""will stay Punjab Congress chief and lead the Congress in next year's election"". ""Chief Minister has invited me for talks... will reciprocate by reaching Punjab Bhawan, Chandigarh at 3:00 PM today, he is welcome for any discussions!"" - Mr Sidhu tweeted. Mohammad Mustafa, adviser to Navjot Sidhu, told NDTV that the ""issue will be resolved soon"". ""The Congress leadership understands Navjot Sidhu and Sidhu is not beyond the Congress leadership. He is not Amarinder Singh, who never cared for the Congress and its leadership,"" Mr Mustafa said. According to him, Mr Sidhu ""acts emotionally at times"" and the Congress leadership understands. Mr Sidhu, named Punjab Congress chief in July as part of a truce brokered by the party, quit on Tuesday saying he could ""never compromise on Punjab's future and the agenda for the welfare of Punjab."" He was upset about key appointments made by new Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, the man who replaced Mr Sidhu's rival Amarinder Singh less than two weeks ago. Mr Sidhu's resignation was a surprise for the Gandhis; Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had supported him against Amarinder Singh, taking a huge political risk close to the polls.  Mr Sidhu has reportedly not spoken to the party leadership since he quit, and had earlier rebuffed Punjab leaders sent to placate him. Yesterday, he posted a video defending his move. ""My fight is issue-based and I have stood by it for a long time. I cannot compromise with my ethics, my moral authority. What I witness is a compromise with issues, agenda in Punjab. I cannot misguide the high command nor can I let them be misguided,"" Mr Sidhu said in Punjabi.   Chief Minister Channi yesterday spoke to Mr Sidhu on the phone and indicated that he could reconsider some of the appointments. ""I told Sidhu that the party believes in consultations, please come and we can fix this. If anyone has any objections to any appointment, then I am not rigid on that.

The Prime Minister said that the Centre wants to ensure that every district in the country has at least one medical college or an institution that provides post-graduate medical education. Speaking at an event, after laying the foundation stone of four medical colleges in Banswara, Sirohi, Hanumangarh and Dausa districts of Rajasthan, PM Modi said, ""This pandemic has taught a lot in the health sector across the world. Every country is engaged in dealing with this crisis in its own way. India has resolved to increase its strength, self-reliance during this time. The beginning of work on four medical colleges in Rajasthan and CIPET-Jaipur is a key step in this regard."" ""Since 2014, the central government has approved 23 new medical colleges for Rajasthan. Out of this, seven medical colleges are already functional and we are laying the foundation for four of them today,"" he said. The Prime Minister recalled that improving the health sector in Gujarat came as a challenge to him when he became the Chief Minister of the state in 2001. ""From medical education to health infrastructure to medical facilities, we tried to change the situation,"" he said. Listing the changes brought by his government in medical education, PM Modi stated that when the NDA-led government came to power in Centre in 2014, there were 82,000 undergraduate and post graduate seats in medical colleges, but the number stands at over 1.4 lakh now. ""Today, India is moving towards an empowered network of 22 AIIMS from 6 AIIMS. In the last six-seven years, over 170 new medical colleges have been started and over 100 new medical colleges are being developed,"" he said. ""We want to ensure that every district has at least one medical college or an institution that provides post-graduate medical education. We have made several reforms to ensure this in the last few years,"" said PM Modi. ""The health system of our country was divided at several levels. There was a lack of connectivity and collective approach in health systems between states. There was a massive gap between primary healthcare and big hospitals. It was of paramount importance to remove these bottlenecks. To transform the medical system, we worked on a new medical system for the entire country. Initiatives such as Swachh Bharat, Ayushman Bharat and Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission are all part of that view,"" he added.

The family of the businessman had earlier alleged ""vicious"" assault by the police during a raid. A murder case has been filed against three cops. On Monday, Manish Gupta, 36, a property dealer from Kanpur, was visiting Gorakhpur - along with two friends - to meet a fourth associate. Led by a senior police inspector, six Gorakhpur cops allegedly barged into their hotel room past midnight and allegedly assaulted Mr Gupta and his friends when asked to explain the late-night checks. After the alleged assault, Mr Gupta's family said, the police also delayed taking him to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted by a panel of doctors on Tuesday, about 15 hours after the businessman's death. It lists various injuries the businessman suffered, including a swelling in the middle of his head, a cut above the elbow joint and injuries to the upper lip. After nationwide criticism over the businessman's death, six cops were suspended on Tuesday night, but only three of them have been named as accused in a murder case filed by the police after the businessman's wife filed a complaint. In her complaint, the wife had named six policemen, but it is not clear why all of them have not been named in the FIR (first information report). A widely shared video on social media shows top officials allegedly trying to dissuade the family from filing a police case. It is not clear who shot the video but as per reports it was filmed by a family member of Mr Gupta during a meeting with Gorakhpur district magistrate Vijay Kiran Anand and police chief Vipin Tada, hours before the FIR was filed in the case. The video appears to show the district magistrate telling the family that ""a court case will take years"". ""I am requesting you like an elder brother. After a court case, you will not believe, it takes years in court,"" Mr Anand purportedly says in the video The video then appears to show police chief Tada interjecting, and saying ""they (cops) did not have any previous enmity. They went in uniform and that is why I am listening to you since morning. You asked for them to be suspended and I did that. They will not be reinstated till they get a clean chit."" ""I want their jobs taken"", a woman's voice is heard before the two officials appear to realise they are being filmed and ask for it to be stopped.   Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav met with the family of Mr Gupta in Kanpur this morning. ""Till the BJP government is in power you cannot hope for any justice from the police. A sitting judge of the high court or the CBI should enquire into this matter. Why have the District Magistrate or SSP not been suspended despite their efforts that an FIR was not registered in the case?"" Mr Yadav asked after the meeting. The family is also expected to meet with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who had announced a compensation of ₹ 10 lakh for the family, later today."

""So far I am in the Congress but I will not remain in the Congress. I have already made my position very clear. I will not be treated in this manner,"" the Captain said in an interview a day after meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi. Soon after the reveal, he dropped ""Congress"" from his Twitter bio. A formal resignation would come at an ""appropriate time"", he said. Pulling no punches, the Captain also predicted the Congress's downfall in Punjab - in the run-up to the polls - and called his rival Navjot Singh Sidhu a ""childish man"" who had been given a serious job by the party. ""I have been in politics for 52 years. I have my own beliefs, my own principles. The way I have been treated... At 10.30 am the Congress President says you resign. I didn't ask any questions. I said I will do it just now. At 4 pm I went to the Governor and resigned... If you doubt me after 50 years and my credibility is at stake... if there is no trust, what is the point of me staying in the party?"" Before quitting on September 18, Amarinder Singh had told Sonia Gandhi that he had been humiliated thrice by the party. ""I have made my stand very clear to the Congress that I will not be treated in this manner. I will not stand for it. I have not resigned from the Congress yet, but how can one continue in a place where there is a trust deficit? When there is no trust, one cannot continue,"" he said. On the big question that all, including the Congress, have for him after his meeting with Amit Shah, Mr Singh asserted: ""I am not joining the BJP"". He added: ""I have not resigned from the Congress but I will resign. I am not a person who takes split-second decisions. But I am not joining the BJP."" Navjot Sidhu, who played a big role in the two-time Chief Minister's abrupt exit, has also stunned the party by resigning as Punjab Congress chief. ""Sidhu is an immature person. I have said this repeatedly, that he is not a stable man. He is not a team player. He is a loner. How will he handle the Punjab Congress as its chief? For that you need to be a team player, which Sidhu is not,"" Mr Singh said. ""Sidhu is good at drawing crowds. He is good at drama. He can do what he did in Kapil Sharma's show and get a crowd, but he is not a serious guy. How can a non-serious person be taking serious, major decisions in the running of a party and the state government?"" On Rahul Gandhi, who is facing criticism for his handling of the Punjab leadership mess, Mr Singh said: ""He wants to bring young blood into the party but refuses to listen to the advice of older party leaders."" The Captain predicted doom for the Congress in the Punjab election due early next year. ""The Congress is going downhill. In the current scenario, we see in a recent survey done by the Congress between July and September that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is going up and the Congress is going down. The people clearly don't have any trust in Sidhu. Congress has seen a 20% decline according to that survey,"" he said. ""This election will be very different with Congress, AAP, Akali Dal, factions of the Akali Dal, and there may be another front emerging too... so, it will be a very different election,"" he commented. Was he preparing to set up a new outfit? Mr Singh did not answer. Amid signs of another high-profile exit, the Congress had reached out to Amarinder Singh. Sources said senior Congress leaders Ambika Soni and Kamal Nath tried to placate Mr Singh. But the Captain, who has been in Delhi since Tuesday, tellingly never sought any meeting with his party president as he continues his meetings with the ""other side"".   The former Chief Minister met with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval this morning. Sources say he may have discussed Punjab border security amid political turmoil in the state. The 79-year-old stalwart had till now kept the Congress on edge, neither confirming nor denying that he is exploring his options after his exit."

The price of petrol was hiked to ₹ 101.64 a litre in Delhi and to ₹ 107.71 per litre in Mumbai, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers. Diesel rates increased to ₹ 89.87 a litre in Delhi and ₹ 97.52 in Mumbai. Prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes. This is the second price increase in petrol since the ending of a three-week-long hiatus in rate revision and the fifth in the case of diesel. The hike took the retail price of petrol to a near-record high. Petrol had hit a record high of ₹ 101.84 a litre in Delhi in July and ₹ 107.83 in Mumbai. For diesel, the increase led to rates equalling the all-time high of ₹ 89.87 a litre touched in Delhi in the same month. International oil prices are at three year high with global benchmark Brent trading at USD 78.64 per barrel. This spurt in global rates led state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) resuming daily price revisions on September 24, ending the pause in rates that came into effect from September 5. In five price increases since September 24, diesel rates have gone up by 1.25 paise per litre, negating all of the price reductions that happened between July 18 and September 5. Petrol price has increased by 50 paise per litre in two installments this week. Before this, diesel price was last increased on July 15. The last increase in petrol rate was on July 17. International crude oil prices have reached a nearly three-year high as global output disruptions have forced energy companies to draw more crude oil out of their stockpiles. When international oil rates fell in July and August, retail prices of petrol and diesel in the Delhi market were reduced by ₹ 0.65 and ₹ 1.25 per litre. Prior to that, the petrol price was increased by ₹ 11.44 a litre between May 4 and July 17. Diesel rate had gone up by ₹ 9.14 during this period.   The price hike during this period pushed petrol prices above the ₹ 100-a-litre mark in more than half of the country, while diesel crossed that level in at least three states. India is dependent on imports to meet nearly 85 per cent of its oil needs and so benchmarks local fuel rates to international oil prices.

Even those with a normal body mass index who can no longer wear their old trousers are ""carrying too much fat,"" the newspaper reported, citing Roy Taylor, a professor from Newcastle University.  Early results from a study Taylor presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes's annual conference showed that 8 out of 12 people who had diabetes despite a normal BMI managed to beat it by losing 10% to 15% of their body weight, which cut levels of fat in the liver and pancreas. That helped to control blood sugar levels, resulting in patients no longer needing medication.

A group of six women gathered outside a high school in eastern Kabul demanding the right for girls to return to secondary school, after the hardline Islamist group excluded them from classes earlier this month. The women unfurled a banner that read ""Don't break our pens, don't burn our books, don't close our schools"", before Taliban guards snatched it from them. They pushed back the women protesters as they tried to continue with the demonstration, while a foreign journalist was hit with a rifle and blocked from filming. A Taliban fighter also released a brief burst of gunfire into the air with his automatic weapon, AFP journalists saw. The demonstrators -- from a group called the ""Spontaneous Movement of Afghan Women Activists"" -- took refuge inside the school. Taliban guard Mawlawi Nasratullah, who led the group and identified himself as the head of special forces in Kabul, said the demonstrators ""did not coordinate with security authorities regarding their protest"". ""They have the right to protest in our country like every other country. But they must inform the security institutes before,"" he said. Isolated rallies with women at the forefront were staged in cities around the country after the Taliban seized power, including in the western city of Herat where two people were shot dead. But protests have dwindled since the government issued an order that unsanctioned demonstrations and warned of ""severe legal action"" for violators. It has been almost two weeks since girls were prevented from going to secondary school. The Taliban follow a strict interpretation of sharia law that segregates men and women, and have also slashed women's access to work.   They have said they need to establish the right conditions before girls can return to the classroom, but many Afghans are sceptical.

Barricades were knocked down despite huge police presence. The face-off in the midst of sloganeering was captured in visuals that showed a huge crowd of the demonstrators. Situation remained tense as policemen tried to stop the protesters. Farmers in many parts of Haryana, who have been protesting against the controversial farm laws, have maintained they won't allow any events by the ruling BJP. Today's protests erupted against the event in Karnal's Indri. Haryana has seen several instances of protesting farmers' face-off with the police since the protests began last year against the farm laws. Last month, at least 10 people were injured after the state police lathi-charged a group as traffic was blocked on a highway while the demonstrators headed towards Karnal to protest against a BJP meeting. A controversial video showing IAS officer Ayush Sinha asking policemen to ensure tough action against protesters led to widespread criticism and a stalemate - between the demonstrators and the state government - that continued for more than a week. ""We will not let this line be breached at any cost. Just pick up your lathi and hit them hard... It's very clear, there is no need for any instruction, just thrash them hard. If I see a single protester here, I want to see his head smashed, crack their heads,"" Mr Sinha was heard saying in the video. He was sent on a month-long leave and a probe by a former judge was launched against him.   Today, the state government also told the Supreme Court that ""sincere efforts are being made to remove the blockades from inter-state roads and National Highways"" but a resolution is yet to be reached. ""Blockades can't happen perpetually,"" the Supreme Court said.

""Shocked and disgusted to hear the news of attack and hooliganism at Kapil Sibal's house.

Those responsible must be identified and disciplined,"" the former Union Minister wrote, not holding back while slamming Congress workers. A group of Congress workers last evening held up ""Get well soon, Kapil Sibal"" placards, threw tomatoes at his house and damaged his car. Workers of the Youth Congress also raised slogans of ""Leave the party! Come to your senses!"" and ""Rahul Gandhi Zindabad!"" The episode highlights internal turmoil boiling over in the party as it struggles with a huge crisis in Punjab, barely four months before state polls, after the sudden resignation of its state chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. Mr Sidhu's move has shocked the Gandhis, who had backed him in his feud against Amarinder Singh, a two-time Punjab Chief Minister who quit earlier this month citing repeated humiliation by the party. Mr Sibal yesterday questioned who was taking calls in the Congress. ""In the Congress there is no elected president now. Who is taking calls? We don't know who is taking decisions in the party,"" he had said. He also declared that he would keep raising questions as ""We are G-23, definitely not Ji Huzoor-23."" Mr Sibal and Anand Sharma are both in the ""G-23"" or the group of 23 dissident Congress leaders who wrote an unprecedented letter to Sonia Gandhi last year calling for a complete turnaround in the Congress and a ""full-time, visible leadership"". Ghulam Nabi Azad, another signatory to the letter, wrote again yesterday urging Sonia Gandhi to call a meeting of the Congress Working Committee to decide on a full-time party president. Many Congress leaders publicly attacked Mr Sibal.     Sonia Gandhi has been interim chief since 2019, when her son Rahul Gandhi quit over the Congress's second straight national election defeat.

Nisha Desai Biswal, president of US-India Business Council and a former US diplomat, was speaking at a dinner hosted by Indiaspora. ""The time has come for us to get serious about where the next frontier is in US India ties. And neither for the United States, nor for India, is it tenable for two of the largest economies in the world to be outside of the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) and to not have a trade architecture in place between the two of them,"" Nisha Desai Biswal, president of US India Business Council said. ""We are starting to see real signals of interest from India to be able to explore that. So, I think the time has come to get serious. It's not easy. It's a path riddled with all kinds of obstacles,"" she said. ""I've heard it described to me that trade negotiations are a knife fight in a dark alley. It's time for us to put down the knives, turn on the light, get down to business,"" she said in a lighter vein as she urged the powerful group of Indian Americans to engage the two governments on the issue. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, while addressing the 4th Annual Leadership Summit of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) on Wednesday, said that India and the US should engage in a much bigger way and New Delhi is ready and willing to expand the economic partnership with America. He also called for setting an ambitious bilateral trade target of USD 1 trillion in the next 10 years. On August 19, he said that hopes of an India-US trade pact are off the table for now, with the Biden administration conveying to India that it is not interested in a free trade agreement. According to the data of the commerce ministry, in 2020-21, the trade between the US and India dropped to USD 80.5 billion as compared to USD 88.9 billion in 2019-20. India's exports to the US are growing rapidly and withdrawal of export incentives by the US under GSP (Generalised System of Preferences) has not impacted the country's outbound shipments to America. India is seeking exemption from high duties imposed by the US on some steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under the GSP, and greater market access for its products from sectors such as agriculture, automobile, automobile components and engineering. On the other hand, the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices, apart from cut in import duties on some information and communication technology products. In her brief remarks on the occasion, Neera Tanden, senior advisor to President Joe Biden, said it is critical to have Indian-Americans at the table, contributing, involved and engaged in helping make decisions. ""Because as many have said before now, if you are not at the table, you are on the menu. So that is why your voices are so important. Why is it that your engagement is so important, why is your role here in everything you do is so important?,"" she said. Former US Ambassador to India, Richard Verma, said the recent successful visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi shows the new chapter in this important bilateral relationship. ""We can't just let it coast. We've got to all now work on it. The president gave us the roadmap to follow in trade and health and climate and security and, and so much more. I'm actually pretty excited about the bilateral ties and even broader on Quadrilateral ties as well,"" he said.   Indian-American congressmen Raja Krishnamoorthi and Dr Ami Bera also spoke on the occasion.

She said the IAF (Indian Air Force) doctors subjected her to the banned and intrusive two-finger test, the use of which has triggered widespread outrage in the past over violating the survivor's right to privacy. It is also believed to be unscientific. In her police complaint, the officer also alleged that she was questioned about her ""sexual history"". The woman, who had travelled to the Air Force College for training, said the assault took place inside her room at the Air Force Administrative College in Coimbatore's Redfields. The assault took place about two weeks ago and the officer said she was forced to go to the police because she was not satisfied with action taken by the IAF after her original complaint. Twice, she said, she was made to submit a withdrawal - of the complaint letter - in writing and another time, she was asked to sign a letter with changes made, which she refused to sign. In a statement, the Air Force said: ""The IAF is cooperating with the police investigation and is also conducting an internal inquiry. We cannot comment any further as the matter is subjudice."" The initial investigation was carried out by an all-women team from the city's Gandhipuram Police Station. A case of sexual assault under section 376 was registered. The accused officer, a 29-year-old Flight Lieutenant, had come from Chattisgarh for training at the Air Force Facility near Race Course, officials say.   He was arrested by the city police amid objection from his lawyer, who said that ""the Coimbatore Police don't have powers to arrest an Air Force officer"". He argued ""only military procedure ought to be followed"". The court had initially remanded the accused for two days. Coimbatore Commissioner of Police Deepak M Damor told NDTV, ""There is no provision in (the) law to transfer an FIR to the Air Force. Police will complete the investigation and file a report before the court."" The National Commission for Women (NCW) has said it has taken note of a report about the Air Force officer being subjected to two-finger test by Indian Air Force doctors.  NCW chief Rekha Sharma, the women's body said, has written to the Air Chief Marshal to look into the matter.

Senior Congress leaders Ambika Soni and Kamal Nath are trying to placate Amarinder Singh, sources say. But the Captain, who has been in Delhi since Tuesday, has tellingly not sought any meeting with his party president Sonia Gandhi as he continues his meetings with the ""other side"". The former Chief Minister met with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval this morning. Sources say he may have discussed Punjab border security amid political turmoil in the state. The 79-year-old stalwart has kept the Congress on the edge, neither confirming nor denying that he is exploring his options after being forced to quit as Punjab Chief Minister on September 18, just four months before state polls. On landing in Delhi on Tuesday, he denied any plan to meet with BJP leaders, claiming he only wanted to vacate the Kapurthala House for new Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi. His meeting with Amit Shah finally did happen last evening. After the one-hour meeting, the Captain said he had discussed the farm laws at the core of an 11-month farmers' protest and ways to resolve the deadlock. He said he had urged Amit Shah to guarantee minimum support price to farmers and support Punjab in crop diversification. ""Met Union Home Minister @AmitShah ji in Delhi. Discussed the prolonged farmers agitation against FarmLaws and urged him to resolve the crisis urgently with repeal of the laws and guarantee MSP (Minimum Support Price), besides supporting Punjab in crop diversification. #NoFarmersNoFood,"" Mr Singh posted.   His team called the meeting with Mr Shah a ""courtesy visit"" and sources said he had not taken any decision on joining the BJP.   For the BJP, the two-time Chief Minister will be a big catch, given that the party has no face in Punjab and its long-time ally Akali Dal broke off ties over the farmer protests. If Mr Singh swaps parties, the poll math could change vastly in Punjab and encourage the BJP to put up a fight in a state where it has only ever been junior partner."

The dinner was attended by the who's who of the Indian-American community. Eminent members of the Indian-American community had gathered for the first time in Washington after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the US. During the visit, there was an important bilateral meeting between President Biden and Prime Minister Modi, the first one since the Biden-Harris administration was inaugurated in January this year.

From Washington DC, the Prime Minister went to New York where he addressed the UN General Assembly. Quickly running through some of the important areas during the trip in addition to the strategic ones, Sandhu said the prime minister had a good exchange on regional issues as well as other international challenges. ""Quad is a group of like-minded countries which are coming together because today's challenges are much international in nature. For example, COVID,"" he said. The US, India, Australia and Japan had in 2017 given shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the ""Quad"" or the Quadrilateral coalition to counter China's aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region. In affordable health care, he said, India is an important partner. ""There is tremendous scope for us, bilaterally to help each other and also to third countries,"" he said. As India resumes its export of vaccines, he noted there would be close cooperation with the United States and other like-minded countries   Digital, IT, startups and innovation holds a lot of promise in the bilateral relationship with the US. Climate change, environment and knowledge and education are other major areas of cooperation between the two countries.

1184,Thu Sep 30 05:01:21 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: Why The Gaza Strip May Be The City Of The Future https://t.co/vP43QMMMXP https://t.co/sVrDe4kmXl,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-the-gaza-strip-may-be-the-city-of-the-future-2558580,Why The Gaza Strip May Be The City Of The Future,"When Americans turned on the TV or glanced at their smartphones for news of the deadly clashes that engulfed the Gaza Strip in May - or if they followed the more recent spasm of violence in August that threatened to break the region's fragile truce - many saw scenes that looked familiar: streets flooded with protesters, engaged in a struggle against highly armed security forces on the streets of a battered-looking city. In many ways, the political and physical conditions of the Gaza Strip are unique: Nearly 2 million people are packed into a 25-mile-long rectangle of land along the Mediterranean roughly the size of Philadelphia. For decades, the territory has been home to Palestinians displaced by the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, and subject to Israeli occupation since the 1967 Six-Day War. But since 2007, after the political wing of the Islamist group Hamas was elected to power, Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade. In response, Hamas militants have attacked Israel with suicide bombers and missile attacks, and the two sides have settled into a gruesome rhythm of low levels of violence punctuated by intense conflagrations. In May's fighting, as many as 260 Palestinians were killed; in Israel, 12 people were killed. 
Gaza is a landscape of extreme economic deprivation born of the region's complicated political dynamics - but one whose contours may soon become more common.  That's the premise behind the recently released book Open Gaza: Architectures of Hope, published by imprint . Edited by , an urban geographer who focuses on the Middle East, and essayist, theorist, activist, and provocateur Michael Sorkin, the book presents a vision of Gaza as a glimpse of an imminent future, where violence, surveillance, resource scarcity and provisional use of an extremely compromised built environment are visited on all.  Sharp sees connections, for example, between the unrest in Gaza and the racial justice demonstrations in U.S. cities after the murder of George Floyd in 2020: In both, the key issue is who has a right to the city - the right to claim contested urban space. ""The Black Lives Matter protests and that broader movement and recognition of the types of oppression that are going on [in Gaza] is something that's been made visible,"" he says.  The Gaza Strip, the book's promotional copy declares, is ""one of the most beleaguered environments on earth."" But the territory and its urban center, Gaza City, is appallingly understudied in terms of architecture and urbanism. That makes it a fitting swan song for Sorkin, who died last year of Covid-19. ""Michael wanted to go where others wouldn't dare,"" says Sharp. Featuring contributions from scholars, urbanists and architects from the occupied Palestinian territories, Israel, India, the U.S. and the U.K., the book's essays explore the extant condition of Gaza and its wider socio-political context, and offer speculative designs aimed at wresting back sovereignty and dignity for its residents. It posits that the ad-hoc, low-carbon design techniques that Gazans have developed look ahead to a planet failing to meet the challenges of a climate cataclysm, a global pandemic, and growing inequality. As brittle regimes are wracked by crises, mass migrations harden borders, and infrastructure buckles, Open Gaza suggest that the rest of the world may start to look more and more like Gaza. Or has already. Anyone who's searched for clean water in Flint or has seen their home destroyed in wildfires or floods might understand what who contributed to the book, means when she says, ""The Palestinianization of cities is happening worldwide. It's happening by destruction and erasure, but also with dramatic climate change.""  Eco-Adaptation by Necessity Open Gaza isn't content to just praise the ingenuity and resourcefulness of Gazan and allied urbanists and architects; nor is the book interested in depicting Gaza purely as a dystopian prison. ""You could call [these visions] utopian, but I think these are alternative possibilities,"" says Sharp. ""They're not fantasies."" Instead, the collection serves as a ""demand that [Gazans] be able to live and shape their urban context and infrastructure, and social lives in ways that are dignified and respectful of their humanity,"" he says. The book presents Gaza's architectural condition - extant and speculative - as defined by its power imbalance with Israel. This asymmetry means Open Gaza is free of the antiseptic techno-solutionism that often populates architecture tomes. Such documents often claim that low-carbon buildings, made from nothing more than the trees and dirt on their plot of earth, will exist in an atmosphere of happy consumers sipping lattes poured by robots, munching on locally sourced avocado BLTs. Open Gaza tells us this scenario might be a fairy tale. The book's prescriptions operate with found conditions and severe local constraints on materials; it suggests that your first shower warmed by solar power might happen in between air-raid sirens. This reality is why buzzwords like ""sustainability"" or ""resilience"" don't mean anything to the average Gazan, says Palestinian architect Salem Al Qudwa, who writes about the territory's quotidian, everyday buildings. , recycling brick may be a way to save carbon and bestow new buildings with the patina of age. But in Gaza, there is no choice.  Al Qudwa has developed ""incremental housing"" templates, he says, that begin by setting foundations and structural columns, and letting Gazans fill in the gaps, creating a low-cost lattice for expandable housing units that feature shaded courtyards and roof decks. Homes often lack electricity, so cross-breezes are essential. Made from local materials, they offer climate-attunement Al Qudwa says non-local NGOs intent on building often miss. ""My people need decent shelter,"" he says. ""A good house with proper insulation, with natural light, etc."" There is no nostalgia for vernacular buildings or ways of living, says Sharif, but these practices are critical. ""Gaza is looking at environmental practices out of necessity,"" she says. ""The only way forward is [through] traditional ways of living because there is no alternative."" Rafi Segal and Chris Mackey's ""Solar Dome"" - whose name riffs on  - makes the convincing case that there are few places better suited to an entirely solar grid. Gazans uses less than 2% of the average American's energy footprint, and Gaza's sunny climate further reduces the need for expensive energy storage. And the concept of ""energy independence"" takes on new meaning when citizens acquire utilities from . As such, Segal and Mackey recommend a system of building-scaled photovoltaic panels augmented with solar water heaters, and a district-scaled system of concentrated solar power towers. Similarly, a chapter by Denise Hoffman Brandt unveils a plan for pavilions that collect fresh rainwater and use sunlight to desalinate groundwater, and floating ocean desalination pods made from trash. Sharif's ""Learning Room"" plan, detailed in her chapter of Open Gaza written with Nasser Golzari, addresses the imposed mutability of Gaza's built environment. A system of modular, mobile shelters made from , rammed earth, wire mesh, bamboo, and more, it's a migrating community center for exchanging skills, made from rubble itself. ""The idea of the was not to see it as a permanent structure that is going to shape the identity of the city,"" says Sharif. ""It was an experimental space [you] can keep modifying and changing. It's not a new urban structure. It's more of a lab to allow new structures to happen."" In this way, the Learning Room underscores the difficulty of long-term planning in Gaza. It also distills the tactical flexibility Gazans must demonstrate to keep themselves housed. Western architects have made it a polemic to use only materials close at hand - to design their buildings as a bird builds a nest. Architect Jeanne Gang , but it's unlikely Gazans need such a reminder.  The most visceral and imaginative collision of low-carbon aspiration with apocalyptic utility arrives in Helga Tawil-Souri's chapter on the IPN: ""The Internet Pigeon Network."" To surmount Israeli restrictions on electricity and bandwidth, the NYU media scholar proposes a decentralized network of pigeon roosts, trainers, and pick-up nodes. This avian internet would fly pigeons with flash disks tied to their necks from point to point, offering a faster and more secure way to share information. Reliant on local knowledge and labor, it's another way of Gaza asserting infrastructural independence. A Different Kind of Smart City But it's not as though the built environment of Gaza is untouched by technology. In some ways, the digital network that monitors the city and its residents represents a variation on the data-intensive ""smart city"" concept - another way Gaza looks ahead to the future. Since 2014, Gaza's reconstruction has been managed through an online database called the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism (GRM). , the GRM records all the building material that flows in through its border, along with what it's to be used for and who will receive it. The mechanism, designed to ensure that resources aren't being used for military purposes by Hamas, was agreed upon by Israel and Palestine, and was meant to be temporary. But Franceco Sebregondi of  says it puts Israel in an ""ultimate supervisory role"": His chapter in Open Gaza, called ""Frontier Urbanization,"" details how the GRM gives Israeli authorities a granular picture of Gaza's built condition, and the ability to delay Gaza's rebuilding. Such omniscience is increasingly a goal of the design and building industry, where there's a push to translate plans into data and ensure that what's built closely aligns with digital models, to more efficiently manage construction and operational performance. But that's not the only way it could be used. How much of this information, for example, might a refugee resettlement nonprofit at the U.S.-Mexico border want to share with immigration authorities? While the GRM is relatively primitive, its broad usage across Gaza still creates a map of its reconstruction that exists nowhere else. For , who earned a Ph.D. on the architecture of the Gaza blockade from Goldsmiths, University of London, this intrusion reveals that the problem of the smart city is not technical. It's political. As with sunny visions of our eco-friendly future, design and urbanism themselves have no inherent autonomy to resist political agendas, and their calls for ease, efficiency, and low-impact living make ready Trojan Horses for power. ""Who will be in charge of accessing certain data?,"" says Sebregondi. ""What levels of transparency and access [are] granted by using this infrastructure? I don't think that the technologies behind smart urbanism cannot be re-engineered toward serving another idea of collective urban environments. But the ones that are currently marketed and very light-heartedly deployed across our cities tend to pursue the opposite."" This, he says, is a ""dark horizon we need to avoid and fight against."" The complex intimacy of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has turned the region into something of a proving ground for purpose-built surveillance technology that could be plugged into a future smart city. Indeed, Israeli companies are selling cybersecurity technology all over the world, including the U.S., where it's used in a new training center . Sebregondi sees Gaza as further along a continuum of ricocheting colonial violence: As states become more fragile and defensive and climate change adds layers of stress, inequalities skyrocket and people divide into camps. Where these two groups are anywhere near each other, the market for surveillance and control technology booms. Debates over the on the streets of U.S. cities and the rise of privacy-eroding public safety technology have collapsed the distance between Palestine and Pittsburgh. ""There is an extent to which Palestine becomes a sort of crystal [ball] of this particular future, within a very compacted and dense territory, [featuring] some of the most striking aspects of this splintering urbanism,"" says Sebregondi. He describes the ""boomerang effect of colonization,"" where techniques to wield control over restive populations in distant countries eventually come home, as with the NSA's experiments using the .  It's a cycle that's eradicated distance, says Sharp, pulling Gazans and the rest of the world closer together, and bringing the front lines, already at their doorstep, into ours.   ""These circulations of violence and containment,"" he says, ""come back to haunt us all."" (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

Donors from Silicon Valley including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, as well as Facebook Inc., had agreed to fund an evacuation flight for 188 journalists, aid workers and others who were suddenly in danger after the Taliban's quick capture of Kabul. They hoped to get most of those evacuees to Mexico City, via Abu Dhabi, to start a new life. Those plans largely succeeded. But amid the chaos in Afghanistan, they also took an unexpected turn. Shortly before their flight left on August 30, the airline -- Kam Air -- stuffed the half-empty plane with at least 155 additional passengers -- its employees, their families and more, according to US officials and organisers of the flight. The 11th-hour surprise created agita at the State Department and in the United Arab Emirates because the extra passengers -- who weren't on the plane's manifest -- hadn't been screened for that flight and raised security and immigration concerns. It also created angst among many of the organisers and financial supporters, who say they had carefully vetted the original list of passengers and weren't aware of the extra passengers until the plane landed in Abu Dhabi. ""The 155, not on the FB manifest, were placed on the FB airplane by KAM airlines,"" according to a State Department email obtained by Bloomberg News. ""FB (and everyone else) learned about these individuals when they landed in Abu Dhabi."" The circumstances surrounding their departure underscored the turmoil that followed the US withdrawal from the longest foreign war in American history and the difficulty of controlling events in a war-torn country from halfway around the world. But it also exemplified the ways strange bedfellows -- in this case, Facebook Inc., a prominent tech founder, security firms, consultants and aid agencies -- came together to spirit endangered people out of Afghanistan. A representative for Kam Air didn't respond to requests for comment. Most of the original group of 188 evacuees made it to Mexico, transferring in Abu Dhabi to an EgyptAir flight that continued on to Mexico City via Cairo. The Kam Air employees and other last-minute additions to the Facebook flight remain in the UAE, where they are being vetted with other evacuees, according to administration officials. In a September 20 situation report, US diplomats stationed in Abu Dhabi said their post still ""awaits guidance"" on about 3,600 evacuees in the UAE -- many of whom escaped thanks to help from outside private groups -- “who are not confirmed as belonging to priority categories” such as US citizens or people in immediate danger. At a September 8 press conference, Secretary of State Antony Blinken praised charitable organisations and others that were working to evacuate people from Afghanistan. But he said such privately-founded airlifts create challenges with US personnel on the ground or normal security procedures. ""Some of the groups claiming to have all the documentations and arrangements locked down unfortunately don't,"" he said. While the Facebook flight has been reported previously, Bloomberg News has uncovered new details about it from those on board and others involved in planning the privately funded evacuation, including the involvement of Hoffman, the harrowing days and hours before takeoff, and the unexpected addition of nearly twice as many passengers. Eric Montalvo, a lawyer and former US Marine who helped arrange the flights, was unapologetic for the way the flight transpired, saying the plane had extra room for people whose lives were in danger if they remained in the country. “Extra lives being saved should never be associated with a complaint,” Montalvo said. “Life is precious. One cannot create the circumstances for failure and then blame the victims of that failure for their desire to survive.” The operation was organized by a private, Kirkland, Washington-based security firm called Concentric, with help from Facebook, Montalvo, Amman, Jordan-based Magenta Consulting, and nongovernmental organizations in the U.S. and elsewhere. Their evacuees were Afghan nationals and included at least 75 children, about 30 people affiliated with Facebook such as employees and their families, as well as aid workers, journalists and even a comedian. All of them were at risk of retaliation by the Taliban for their work if they remained in the country. Those evacuees were all on the manifest and the UAE knew they were coming, according to the organizers. “I went out into the private donor network of people that were interested in this and once we had formulated a plan we raised almost a million dollars in 24 hours,” said Roderick Jones, Concentric's executive chairman. “I've always felt there was a moment where you can put private capital and donor money to work where markets or governments can't find solutions. And it turned out this way because we could take the risks, and we could do this thing in the middle.” In a statement Facebook said, “In the process of assisting Facebook employees and close partners to leave Afghanistan, we joined an effort to help a group of journalists and their families who were in grave danger. Thanks to the leadership of the Mexican government and the support of the UAE in providing the initial landing, the journalists have been welcomed in Mexico.”   Hoffman was among the first to fund the effort, according to his philanthropic advisor Dmitri Mehlhorn, who was responding on Hoffman's behalf. He donated money for two other evacuation flights as well as support for Afghans upon arrival at their destinations, Mehlhorn said. Other tech entrepreneurs donated to the operation, according to Concentric, but their identities couldn't be confirmed.

That's up from $3.8 billion at the end of December, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings from family investment company WIT LLC, an acronym for the Walton Investment Team which began disclosing its holdings this year. Most of the money was invested in low-cost exchange-traded funds such as the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets and Short-Term Treasury ETFs, but the family also disclosed stakes in companies including Apollo Global Management Inc., Snowflake Inc. and China's Pinduoduo Inc. The Waltons are the world's wealthiest family, worth $238 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. About half that fortune is tied to the world's largest retailer, the company founded by Sam Walton in 1950. For years, the family kept its investments quiet, but that's proving harder to do as they rake in billions by selling stock in Walmart. The family has sold about $6.5 billion in Walmart stock since the start of 2020. Stakes Revealed Their stake in the business is still extraordinarily large for a public company, but a spate of stock buybacks in recent years by the Bentonville, Arkansas, retailer has prompted them to sell shares to keep their ownership percentage stable. That in turn has flooded the family office and the Walton Family Foundation with cash and required ever more sophisticated investing machinery. Members of the family have also increasingly shown more willingness to share information about their investments and philanthropic pursuits. Ben Walton owns Zoma Capital, which makes investments in areas such as energy and water. A representative for Walton Enterprises the Waltons' primary family office confirmed that WIT is an affiliate that invests on behalf of the family. Dele Butler, senior counsel of investments at Walton Enterprises, is listed on the filings as WIT's primary contact. According to her LinkedIn profile she ""advises and supports the family's growing investment and transaction activity."" Others at the company include Rupal Poltack, president, who joined in 2019 from Fidelity Investments. WIT's disclosures have gone largely unnoticed until now. The company started up in early 2020, state records show, several months before the Walton's family office transferred $48 billion to a separate trust established to divest the clan's shares in the retail giant. Walton Enterprises doesn't disclose its total assets, though tax records of private trusts showed that the family has held stakes in hedge funds run by Tiger Global Management and Viking Global Investors. Walmart Wealth   SEC rules require investors managing more than $100 million in U.S. equities to disclose their holdings, though family offices can appeal to keep these documents confidential. Walton Enterprises has never filed a so-called 13F quarterly report under that name. Other high-profile family offices, including one for Renaissance Technologies' founder James Simons, have started filing reports. Family office disclosures have become a flashpoint in Washington following the collapse of Archegos Capital Management, a personal investment vehicle for Bill Hwang that controlled billions of dollars in stocks that were never reported through quarterly filings."

New Zealand has for months been moving to strengthen its security laws amid heightened fears of lone wolf terror attacks, but the new law was rushed through its parliament after Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen stabbed and wounded seven people in a supermarket in Auckland earlier this month. It is now an offence to plot and prepare a terror attack, which Kris Faafoi, New Zealand's Minister of Justice, said brings security laws in line with most other countries. ""The nature of terrorism has changed. Across the world there are more lone actors, rather than larger organised groups,"" Faafoi said in an emailed statement.

Samsudeen had been convicted and imprisoned for about three years before being released in July. New Zealand had in 2020 unsuccessfully sought to charge Samsudeen with terrorism offences after he bought a hunting knife and was found with Islamic State videos.

The work of the scientists here could be the last chance to save the species that make up the only coral reef in the United States' continental waters. Gavin and his team have diligently recreated the coral reef habitat found in the waters off the southern tip of the state, complete with artificial currents and local fish. They hope to prevent the 18 species of coral in their care from suffering the same mysterious ailment, called SCTLD (stony coral tissue loss disease), that is afflicting their wild cousins. Among the sprawling mangroves and darting schools of fish off the Florida Keys, the damaged corals -- normally dark -- now appear as large white patches on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. The situation is the same all along the Florida Reef Tract, which stretches 360 miles (580 kilometers) from the Dry Tortugas, which are the westernmost islands in the Florida Keys, all the way to the town of St Lucie, located about 120 miles north of Miami. ""It's heartbreaking, and I think the most alarming (thing) about it is that most people don't know it's happening,"" said Michelle Ashton, the communications director of the Fish and Wildlife Foundation of Florida. Rescue What Gavin and his colleagues discover at the Florida Coral Rescue Center could change the future of the state's marine ecosystems. ""We are holding the corals safely and healthy in our care,"" explained Justin Zimmerman, the director of the Orlando-based lab, which opened in 2020 and is managed by aquatic theme park company SeaWorld. ""If they were still in the wild, up to 90 percent of them would have been dead,"" Zimmerman said. The potentially catastrophic SCTLD was first discovered in 2014, near Miami, and has continued to spread rapidly, killing about half of stony coral species, a cornerstone of marine biodiversity. The disease, whose causes are unknown, is now plaguing the animals further into the Caribbean, all the way in Mexico and Belize. The rescue lab's work is part of a project created in 2018 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and includes dozens of public and private organizations. The group, faced with the threat of more than 20 of the 45 species of hard corals in the area going extinct, devised the unprecedented plan to extract healthy corals from the region's waters and care for them in these artificially equipped aquariums in the hope they can be returned to their wild habitats in the future. ""You are looking at the future of Florida Reef Tract in this room,"" Aston said of the corals in the Orlando aquariums. ""And their grandchildren will be what goes back out to the water."" Return to the sea The first part of the rescue plan has allowed wildlife authorities to save nearly 2,000 colonies of corals, now stored at more than 20 institutions in 14 different states. The second part of the plan requires researchers to successfully return the corals to the ocean -- though such an operation would likely take place a long time from now, as corals reproduce very slowly. The scientists are studying the genetics of the rescued animals in an effort to cultivate new specimens that could be more resistant to disease, as well as other threats such as warming water temperatures and pollution. The success or failure of these endeavors could have huge consequences for the region. Stony corals, made up of limestone skeletons, are what create coral reefs, which in turn provide a home for a quarter of marine life. Plus, the structures are natural barriers between the open ocean and land, reducing the strength of waves that hit the coastline, especially during hurricanes and other storms. And a hit to coral health could mean a hit to Florida tourism revenue, as one study estimated that visitors drawn to the state for fishing and diving along the reef generate $8.5 billion. Key Largo resident Steve Campbell, 59, is worried about what comes next. He is sitting next to the small tourist boat he captains, currently anchored in the port. He said the coral disease has already had an impact on his business. ""I've been in the Florida Keys now for 20 years, and I'm out on the water every day,"" he said. ""Obviously we make our living out here, so we take people out to the reef for the enjoyment of seeing the reef.""   ""So for us it's extremely important.""

Ghulam Nabi Azad has written to the interim chief calling for a meeting of the Congress's top body on electing a full-time party president. ""In Congress there is no elected president now. Who is taking calls? We don't know who is taking decisions in the party,"" said senior party leader Kapil Sibal, raising many uncomfortable questions as the party processed its Punjab meltdown. ""We are G-23, definitely not Ji Huzoor-23. We will keep raising issues,"" said Mr Sibal, shooting punches at the Gandhis without naming them. ""Why are people leaving? Maybe we should see whether it is our fault? We have to immediately call a CWC, at least so a dialogue can take place. We won't leave the ideology of the party and go anywhere else. The irony of the Congress is that the chosen ones, those who are close to them (Gandhis) have left and those who they think are not close to them are still there,"" Mr Sibal said. ""We won't leave the ideology of the party or go anywhere else. The Congress is the only party that can save this republic because the present dispensation is destroying the foundations of our republic."" The ""G-23"" first wrote an unprecedented letter last year to Sonia Gandhi asking for sweeping changes in the party and a ""visible and effective leadership"". Since then, various leaders have reminded the Gandhis that nothing has changed on the ground and the Congress down spiral continues. In Punjab, with polls just four months away, a series of disastrous decisions saw the Gandhis backing Navjot Singh Sidhu against Amarinder Singh, who quit as Chief Minister and accused the party of humiliating him thrice. Yesterday, Mr Sidhu quit as Punjab Congress chief just two months after he took charge, leaving the party adrift in a poll-bound state where it was in a strong position even months ago. ""Punjab is a border state. Pakistan exploits the situation,"" said Mr Sibal, echoing Amarinder Singh's criticism of the party for handing the reins of Punjab to Mr Sidhu. In recent weeks, the Congress has lost leaders like Sushmita Dev and Luizinho Faleiro. The nosebleed started when Jyotiraditya Scindia, one of Rahul Gandhi's closest confidantes, switched to the BJP last year. Earlier this year, Jitin Prasada followed. In Rajasthan, the party has yet to resolve the Ashok Gehlot versus Sachin Pilot feud.  Even as Mr Sibal addressed the media this afternoon, Mr Faleiro, a veteran Goa leader, was being welcomed aboard by the Trinamool Congress in Kolkata.   ""I am really very, very upset that I have to come to you. But we have no choice. I can't see the Congress in this situation,"" Mr Sibal told reporters. Later in the evening, members of Indian Youth Congress held protests outside Kapil Sibal's residence, holding ""Get Well Soon, Kapil Sibal"" placards."

The BJP put up a tough fight there through its Suvendu Adhikari, a confidant-turned-foe of the Chief Minister.

Waze will instead be shifted to Taloja Jail Hospital. The court has, however, allowed home food to be delivered to him and said that he can be shifted to the JJ Hospital in case of emergency. He had undergone a heart bypass surgery on September 13 at a private hospital. Waze, in his application, while seeking house arrest for a period of three months, had said he had undergone a complex cardiac surgery with five grafts and that there was a high possibility of contracting an infection in a non-sterile environment. Waze was also ready to bear the cost of posting seven police guards at his house. Waze's lawyer argued that the four walls and the roof of the jail should be replaced by four walls and the roof of his house. He stressed that the rules and regulations as set out in the jail manual could be followed. During the argument of the case, Waze's lawyer said that there is no question of absconding because Waze would be in their custody, there will be security staff, the room where he will stay will have different access. ""His wife and daughter will only meet him for medication and food. The advocates will meet me as per the jail manual once or twice a week. This is only with the intention of ensuring a clean environment and medical treatment is available to the accused. Tuberculosis is one of the life-threatening infections that occur in jails,"" the lawyer argued. Special NIA Judge AT Wankhede while going through Waze's report from the private hospital that stated that he would recover within four to five weeks and can lead a normal life questioned the need for house arrest. Special Public Prosecutor representing NIA argued that in the garb of house custody, what the accused was seeking was interim bail. He further added that the ""fundamental right of an accused is there, no doubt. But the court has to balance this right with that of the public interest. The hospital discharge summary has been received. Instructions on post-discharge care are given. It states that the accused can start his day-to-day work. In fact, after six weeks, he can begin heavy-duty work."" The Public Prosecutor further gave the option of a civic-run hospital if the accused so desired that he should be kept away from jail. ""My further investigation could get hampered if this is allowed. In house custody, relatives and other people could come and meet and witnesses could be affected,"" said the Public Prosecutor. NIA arrested Waze in March in connection with the investigation into the recovery of explosives from a car parked near Mukesh Ambani's house in Mumbai. Waze is the prime accused of placing an explosives-laden vehicle near Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani's house Antilia in Mumbai on February 25. Waze was also accused of the murder of Mansukh Hiren, the owner of the vehicle that was found containing explosives materials outside Antilia. Hiren was found dead on March 5 in Thane.   Waze, former Assistant Police Inspector in the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU), was later transferred to the Citizen Facilitation Centre at Mumbai Police Headquarters after his name came up in Mansukh Hiren's death case. Waze was dismissed from service in May 2021."

Kim Yo Jong, a key adviser to her brother, was promoted to a position on the State Affairs Commission, amid a raft of changes approved by the Supreme People's Assembly, the rubber-stamp parliament. No fewer than nine members of the commission were dismissed, including one of its vice-presidents, Pak Pong Ju, and diplomat Choe Son Hui, a rare senior woman in the North's hierarchy who has played a key role in negotiations with the United States. The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried portraits of the eight new appointees on Thursday, Kim Yo Jong standing out among them both for her youth and as the only woman. She has often been seen in close proximity to her brother -- with whom she went to school in Switzerland -- including at his summits with then-US president Donald Trump and the South's leader Moon Jae-in. Her exact political role has long been the subject of speculation -- as has the possibility that she might one day succeed her brother, a transition that would give the socially conservative North its first female leader. She has at times made vitriolic denunciations of Washington or Seoul in statements carried by state media, particularly ahead of the North blowing up a liaison office on its side of the border that the South had built and paid for. Her relatively junior position as a vice department director of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party gave those declarations an element of ambiguity, and in some cases, she specifically said she was speaking in a personal capacity.   Her official rank has risen and fallen over time, but her new SAC position is by far the most senior post she has held.

The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled in 2016 that the federal government allocated less funds for child and family services of indigenous people compared to non-indigenous people, pushing more indigenous children into foster care. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government appealed the tribunal's 2019 ruling, which ordered the government to pay each affected child C$40,000 ($31,496), the maximum allowed under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The tribunal also said that with some exceptions parents or grandparents of the children would also be eligible for compensation. But Justice Paul Favel of the Federal Court rejected the government's appeal and encouraged the two parties to continue negotiating. ""The parties must decide whether they will continue to sit beside the trail or move forward in this spirit of reconciliation,"" Favel wrote, referring to an indigenous parable about a man who sits beside a trail for so long that it grows over and he loses his way. The tribunal's ruling is expected to cost the federal government billions of dollars. Trudeau's government could appeal the court's decision. In the past his government has argued that although the human rights tribunal was correct in finding discrimination in the system, it overreached by ordering compensation. Indigenous Services Canada, the ministry responsible for the foster children, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society that brought the original complaint, welcomed the ruling, calling it ""a complete rejection of all the government's spurious arguments, and a complete win for kids."" The Canadian government's legal battles with indigenous people have come under increased scrutiny after hundreds of unmarked graves were discovered at the sites of former residential schools.   Up until as recently as 1996, Canada's residential school system separated children from their families and sent them to boarding schools where they were malnourished, beaten and sexually abused in what the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission called ""cultural genocide"" in 2015.

Inmates went to war armed with guns and grenades on Tuesday at the Guayaquil prison complex: a clash between prisoners believed to be linked to Mexican drug gangs -- mainly the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels. Soldiers and a tank guarded the complex Wednesday as police on horseback patrolling the perimeter were confronted by worried family members of the men locked up inside. ""We want information because we don't know anything about our families, our sons,"" said one woman, who would not give her name. ""I have my son there."" Tuesday's violence was the latest in a series of bloody prison clashes that have claimed the lives of about 180 inmates in Ecuador so far this year. The SNAI prison authority said in a tweet that the death of ""more than 100"" prisoners had been confirmed, with 52 more wounded. At least six were beheaded, the national prosecutor's office said earlier in the day, adding that two police officers were wounded in the operation to retake control of the prison. Officers were attacked by inmates with guns. President Guillermo Lasso announced on Twitter that he was declaring a ""state of exception,"" which will allow him to suspend rights and use public force to restore calm. Lasso said that he would head a security committee in Guayaquil to control the emergency, but also guaranteed protection of ""human rights for all those involved."" A police charge on the prison had prevented ""more deaths,"" said the police chief for the city of Guayaquil, Fausto Buenano. Ecuador's prison system has become a battleground for thousands of prisoners with ties to powerful Mexican drug gangs. On February 23, simultaneous riots at four jails including Guayaquil left 79 inmates dead, several of them beheaded. - 'A war' - Last week, police confiscated two pistols, a revolver, some 500 rounds of ammunition, a hand grenade, several knives, two sticks of dynamite and homemade explosives at one of the city's prisons. Two weeks ago, Guayaquil's Prison Number 4 was attacked by drones, part of ""a war between international cartels,"" prison authorities said. There were no casualties in that attack. ""There has been a prison crisis since 2010, with an average of 25 homicides per year, but it has accelerated significantly from 2017 to the peak of this year,"" Ecuadoran security expert Fernando Carrion told AFP. Ecuador's prison system has 65 facilities designed for about 30,000 but which house an actual population of 39,000 inmates. There are chronic staffing shortages. The country's human rights ombudsman said there were 103 killings in prisons in 2020, with corruption enabling inmates to bring in arms and ammunition. Located between Colombia and Peru, the world's leading cocaine producers, Ecuador is a key transit for drug shipments to the United States and Europe. Guayaquil is Ecuador's main port city. Between January and August this year, Ecuadoran authorities seized about 116 tons of drugs, mainly cocaine, compared to 128 tons in all of 2020.   The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) has condemned the ongoing violence in Ecuador's prisons.

The inaugural meeting of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) laid out a lengthy to-do list, but perhaps the most significant achievement was the symbolic restoration of good relations after the damage suffered under the administration of former president Donald Trump. ""It's just a remarkable spirit of cooperation and collaboration, and a desire between the United States and European Union to work very, very closely together,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters. But the summit also set its sights on forced labor, artificial intelligence, digital privacy and protecting human rights activists online, as well as monitoring foreign investment in key sectors and controlling exports of sensitive products. The high-level meetings were held as industries worldwide grapple with shortages of crucial semiconductors that are harming manufacturing, including of autos, and pushing prices higher. The TTC was born out of President Joe Biden's summit in Brussels in June, when he attempted to repair relations battered by Trump's aggressive actions against trade rivals and allies alike, as well as more recent missteps that have riled Brussels. The biggest thorn in the relationship are the Trump-era tariffs on steel and aluminum shipped from Europe, which the Biden administration has suspended but not withdrawn. That dispute loomed over the tech meeting but was not on the agenda, although officials have said recently that they are nearing a permanent solution. The ministers met at a massive World War II-era munitions factory and later steel mill in Pittsburgh that has been converted into an advanced robotics research facility. - Semiconductor supply - The talks were led on the US side by Blinken, Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, and on the European side by EU Executive Vice Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis. They did not announce specific actions but mapped out key areas for 10 working groups to focus on before the next meeting, which likely will be next spring in Europe, according to a European source. ""We represent those largest economies, collectively,"" Blinken said after the meeting. ""When we're working together, we have a unique ability to help shape norms, the standards and rules that govern the way technology is used."" Seeking to address the global shortage of vital computer chips, the officials pledged in their final communique to work together ""on the rebalancing of global supply chains in semiconductors, with a view to enhancing respective security of supply"" and production, including of the most advanced chips. Demand for electronic devices of all kinds has exploded since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, as more people work, study and find entertainment at home. Semiconductor manufacturers at times have had to temporarily close their factories due to Covid-19, leaving them struggling to meet global demand and hamstringing industries including automakers. Raimondo has said the chip shortage is both an economic and a national security concern, and called for investments in domestic manufacturing in the European Union and United States. - Containing China - The lengthy communique does not mention China by name, but the world's second-largest economy is omnipresent throughout, notably in the frequent mentions of concerns posed by ""non-market economies."" In addition to semiconductors, the sides are grappling with how to work together to counter what they view as China's unfair trade practices. The Biden administration so far has continued Trump's strong line towards Beijing, keeping in place punitive duties on Chinese goods, while the European Union has taken a less confrontational stance. The ministers pledged to work jointly and through reforms of the World Trade Organization (WTO). ""We stand together in continuing to protect our businesses, consumers, and workers from unfair trade practices, in particular those posed by non-market economies, that are undermining the world trading system,"" the statement said.   But it also highlighted the need to keep tabs on investments in sensitive areas -- something Washington did when it banned Huawei's participation in the US advanced 5G cellular network -- and control sensitive exports that could undermine national security.

1205,Thu Sep 30 01:20:15 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: Britney Spears' Father Removed As Singer's Guardian After Long Battle https://t.co/YDEHWVkP5o https://t.co/J9I1dtI1m5,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/britney-spears-father-removed-as-singers-guardian-after-long-battle-2558463,Britney Spears' Father Removed As Singer's Guardian After Long Battle,"Britney Spears' father was removed from his controversial role as his daughter's guardian on Wednesday by a Los Angeles judge, ending a long and bitter legal battle by the pop princess. Jamie Spears was suspended with immediate effect and replaced with a temporary conservator ""in the best interests"" of the singer, said Judge Brenda Penny. A hearing to fully terminate the guardianship is expected before the end of the year. ""Mr Spears is ordered to turn over all the conservatorship assets,"" said Penny. Spears' father has controlled her life for the past 13 years, under a controversial legal arrangement that the 39-year-old US singer has slammed as ""abusive"" and that her lawyers had demanded be scrapped. Wednesday's move came after a years-long campaign that played out in public, and after the emergence in the last week of two new powerful documentaries that contained allegations Jamie Spears had bugged his daughter's phone calls. Dozens of supporters had gathered outside a Los Angeles courtroom ahead of the hearing, many carrying colorful signs with slogans such as ""Jail Jamie"" and the ubiquitous ""Free Britney"" plea that has been taken up around the world by her supporters on social media. The ruling came after Spears' lawyer Mathew Rosengart filed a motion to have her father removed. ""Every day that goes by with him as conservator -- every day and every hour -- is one in which he causes his daughter anguish and pain,"" the petition says. Those claims were seemingly bolstered by a New York Times documentary released Friday that alleged Jamie Spears had surveillance devices secretly installed in his daughter's bedroom to record her conversations. ""It really reminded me of somebody that was in prison,"" a former security firm employee told the ""Controlling Britney Spears"" filmmakers. The pop star's lawyers this week said the Times' allegations about her father showed ""horrifying and unconscionable invasions of his adult daughter's privacy."" Jamie Spears denies any illegal surveillance took place. Yet another new documentary -- Netflix's ""Britney vs Spears,"" released on Tuesday -- claims the singer twice tried to hire her own lawyer in the early years of the conservatorship, but was denied. In July, Spears was finally successful in appointing her own lawyer -- Rosengart -- and last month, her father filed a petition for the conservatorship to be ended. - 'Never fit to serve' - In their own petition, Spears' lawyers accused her father of seeking to delay the end of the guardianship for his own financial benefit. His efforts are ""a subterfuge, designed to avoid the stigma of being suspended and its consequences, including the likelihood of disgorgement and rejection of outstanding legal fees,"" the petition alleges. ""Disgorgement"" is a legal term meaning the repayment of ill-gotten gains. Spears' representatives and fans have long accused her father of profiting from the guardianship, which was set up after a highly public 2007 breakdown when the shaven-headed star attacked a paparazzo's car at a gas station. Meanwhile, Jamie Spears has objected to his daughter's choice of a new temporary conservator to replace him, saying that certified public accountant John Zabel lacks the necessary experience, US media reported Monday.   In turn, Spears' lawyers say her father was ""never fit to serve,"" citing in their petition allegations of his ""reported alcoholism"" and ""trauma he caused his daughter since her childhood.""

Talks between Pyongyang and Washington have been effectively at a standstill since the collapse of the Hanoi summit between Kim and then-president Donald Trump over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return. Under Biden, the United States has repeatedly offered to meet North Korean representatives anywhere, at any time, without preconditions, while saying it will pursue denuclearisation. But Kim condemned the declarations as ""nothing more than a facade to mask their deception and hostile acts and an extension of hostile policy from past administrations"", the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported. Under the new administration, ""the US military threat and hostile policy against us have not changed at all but have become more cunning"", he said in a lengthy address to the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), the North's one-party parliament. North Korea has been largely biding its time in recent months as it assessed the Biden government and focussed on domestic issues. It has been behind a rigid self-imposed blockade since early last year to protect itself from the coronavirus pandemic, with the economy suffering as a result and trade with key partner China dwindling to a trickle. But Kim's speech was the latest in a series of actions with international ramifications this month. This week, it tested what it said was a hypersonic gliding missile, and earlier this month announced it had successfully fired a long-range cruise missile, after holding a scaled-down military parade. The North's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes are banned under UN Security Council resolutions, and it is subject to multiple international sanctions as a result. The United States condemned this week's launch, but as recently as Wednesday, its North Korea envoy Sung Kim reiterated the offer of dialogue. ""We are strongly committed to finding a diplomatic path to complete the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,"" he told reporters. ""That hasn't changed at all. ""We had made a number of approaches to the DPRK and proposed dialogues on wide ranges of topics, but we haven't heard back and we hope to hear back soon."" The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Thursday on North Korea, at the request of the United States, France and the United Kingdom, diplomatic sources told AFP Wednesday. North Korea has not shown any willingness to give up its arsenal, which it says it needs to defend itself against a US invasion. In his SPA speech, Kim declared: ""The most fundamental crisis tearing down the basic tenets of international peace and stability is the abuse of power and coercion by the US and its followers."" - 'Double standards' - Washington and Seoul are security allies, and the United States stations around 28,500 troops in the South to protect it from its neighbour. Pyongyang has since then repeatedly excoriated the South and its President Moon Jae-in, and blown up a liaison office on its side of the border that Seoul had built. At the UN General Assembly this month, Moon reiterated his call for a formal declaration of the end of the Korean War, where hostilities ceased in 1953 with a ceasefire rather than a peace treaty. But Kim said the South ""still follows the US,"" and that ""mutual respect must be guaranteed and unfair views and double standards attitude dropped"" before an end-of-war declaration could be agreed. Nonetheless, he expressed a willingness to restore North-South communication lines in early October. Seoul is also spending billions on military development as both Koreas build up their weapons capabilities in what could become an arms race on the peninsula, with ramifications for neighbouring Japan, China and the wider region.   This month, the South successfully test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) for the first time, making it one of a handful of nations with the advanced technology, and this week, it held a ceremony to launch its third submarine capable of carrying SLBMs. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

The FAA told the company it had accepted its proposed corrective actions related to the flight, which saw the SpaceShipTwo vehicle drop below its assigned airspace during its descent back to its runway at Spaceport America in New Mexico. Virgin Galactic will update its calculations for future flights and request more airspace, and promised real-time communication with the FAA during flight operations, the company said. ""Our entire approach to spaceflight is guided by a fundamental commitment to safety at every level, including our spaceflight system and our test flight program,"" said CEO Michael Colglazier in a statement. ""We appreciate the FAA's thorough review of this inquiry. Our test flight program is specifically designed to continually improve our processes and procedures."" The FAA grounded Virgin Galactic earlier this month after an investigative report in The New Yorker said the flight experienced irregularities that could have jeopardized the mission. The article said the pilots encountered cockpit warnings indicating the rocket-powered spaceplane's climb was too shallow and the nose was insufficiently vertical. This could have meant that, after taking its crew to the edge of space, it would have lacked sufficient energy to glide back to its runway on Earth. In the end, the vessel did land on the runway, but its altitude fell lower than it should have. An FAA statement confirmed it had closed its ""mishap investigation."" ""The FAA also found Virgin Galactic failed to communicate the deviation to the FAA as required,"" the statement said -- a line that suggests the agency only learned of the irregularity through the article in The New Yorker.   Virgin Galactic is planning its next test flight, with members of the Italian air force, around mid-October.

Konkola Copper Mines (KCM), co-owned by London-listed Vedanta and Zambia's state mining arm, is one of Africa's largest copper producers. KCM has been caught in a two-year tug-of-war between Vedanta and Zambia, which in 2019 placed KCM in liquidation for allegedly failing to pay taxes. The liquidator, Milingo Lungu, 43, was arrested on charges that he abused his role to cash in on $2.2 million. The Drug Enforcement Commission, which investigates money laundering, also accused Lungu of pocketing another $6.8 million, mostly in local currency. ""He has also been charged for money laundering for the said amounts,"" spokesman Mathias Kamanga said in a statement. ""The money is said to have come into his possession by virtue of being the provisional liquidator for Konkola Copper Mines Plc."" Lungu has since been released on police bond and will appear in court soon, it added. In a statement, Lungu dismissed the allegations as ""baseless and untrue"". Zambia's former government handed KCM over for liquidation in May 2019, sparking a legal dispute with Vedanta, the majority shareholder. President Hakainde Hichilema, elected in August, has criticised his predecessor's nationalist mining policy and vowed to woo foreign investors back to Africa's second-largest copper producer after the Democratic Republic of Congo.   Shortly after Hichilema took office, Vedanta said it was open to dialogue with the state and committed to re-investing $1.5 billion into KCM.

Mohib Ullah was talking with other refugee leaders outside his office after attending evening prayers at around 8:00 pm (1400 GMT) when at least four assailants came to the spot and shot him dead, Rafiqul Islam, police spokesman of Cox's Bazar, told AFP. ""Four to five unidentified assailants shot him from close range. He was declared dead at a MSF hospital in the camp,"" he said. He said police and the Armed Police Battalion, which is tasked with ensuring security for the country's 34 Rohingya camps, have stepped up security, deploying hundreds more armed officers. No one has been arrested yet, according to Islam. ""We are conducting raids in the area,"" he said, adding Ullah had not alerted police of any threats from any group. Mohammad Nowkhim, a spokesman of Ullah's Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights (ARPSH), said Ullah was talking to other Rohingya leaders outside the ARPSH office at Kutupalong, the world's largest refugee settlement, when an unidentified assailant shot him at least three time. ""He was in a pool of blood. He was brought dead to the nearby MSF hospital,"" Nowkhim said from a hideout, adding that many Rohingya leaders have gone into hiding after Ullah's killing. No one has claimed responsibility, but a Rohingya leader told AFP that Ullah was killed by the extremist group Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which was behind several attacks on Myanmar security posts in recent years ""It is a work of ARSA,"" he said. - No one like him - Ullah, who was 48, emerged as the main civilian leader of the persecuted Muslim minority community when more than 740,000 Rohingya took refuge in camps in Bangladesh, after a military crackdown by the Myanmar army on their villages in Rakhine province in August 2017. Ullah formed the ARPSH in a Bangladeshi camp months after the influx, and it helped investigate the carnage carried out by the Myanmar armies and the Buddhist militias during the crackdown. In August 2019, he organised a massive rally at Kutupalong camp, the main Rohingya settlement, which some 200,000 Rohingya attended. The rally confirmed his top leadership among the refugees. That year, he was also flown to the United States, where he attended a religious freedom meeting hosted by the US State Department and led by then-US president Donald Trump. But in recent years, Bangladeshi security forces restricted the activities of Ullah's group. ARPSH was not allowed to hold any rallies during the anniversary of the crackdown in 2020 and 2021. An uneasy calm has descended in the camps, Rohingya leaders and rights activists monitoring the settlements said, adding Ullah's killing will have bigger ramifications. ""We do not expect another progressive leader like him in the Bangladesh camps. We are very saddened by his untimely death,"" Rohingya artist Mayyu Khan wrote on Facebook. The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, said it was ""deeply saddened by the killing of Mr Mohib Ullah, a prominent Rohingya refugee representative"".   ""We are in continuous contact with law enforcement authorities in charge of maintaining peace and security in the camps,"" the UNHCR spokesperson in Bangladesh, Regina De La Portilla, told AFP.

The political circle in the state was abuzz with speculation that the legislators have gone to express their support to Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel. However, the MLAs who have reached the national capital said their visit was linked with the proposed tour of former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi to the state. ""Around 15-16 party MLAs have reached Delhi and are staying at different places. Rahul ji's visit to Chhattisgarh is proposed. We wanted to convey a request to Rahul ji through our state in-charge P L Punia ji that he should extend a little the duration of his tour so that all the MLAs could get benefit of it,"" said Brihaspat Singh, the party MLA from Ramanujganj seat of state. ""We have come to Delhi just to make this request and we will speak to Punia sir on Thursday in this regard. Our visit should not be seen in other way,"" he told PTI over phone from Delhi. When asked whether their visit was aimed at expressing support to Mr Baghel, Mr Singh said, ""Our party has 70 MLAs (in the 90-member state assembly), of whom 60 legislators had last time told everything to Punia ji. When there is blessing of the high command, support of the MLAs and the chief minister is working well, then no such issue (of leadership change) exists."" He also denied the alleged tussle between Mr Baghel and state health minister TS Singh Deo and said that both the leaders had recently shared the stage and exchanged sweets. He also said that they respect each other. ""The situation in Chhattisgarh is not similar to Punjab. The high command of any party would not put the entire government at stake just to make one leader happy...,"" he said without naming anyone. Mr Singh, considered as close to Mr Baghel, was embroiled in a controversy in July this year when he alleged that there was a threat to his life from Singh Deo. However, the MLA, who hails from Singh Deo's home turf Sarguja, later withdrew the claim. The demand for a change of guard reared its head after Mr Baghel completed two and a half years as chief minister in June 2021. Singh Deo camp claimed that the high command in 2018 had agreed to hand over the post to him after the government completed half its term. Congress in-charge of the state PL Punia has time and again denied that any such deal was struck in 2018 when the party came to power by dislodging the BJP. The Congress high command summoned both Mr Baghel and Singh Deo to Delhi in August to resolve the feud. It appeared that Mr Baghel had won this round when he told reporters upon return that party leader Rahul Gandhi had agreed to visit the state ''on his invitation'', and those talking about rotating the CM's post were promoting political instability.   As many as 54 out of 70 Congress MLAs had visited Delhi separately when Mr Baghel was in the national capital, in an apparent show of strength on his side. While both Mr Baghel and Singh Deo have desisted from saying anything about the leadership issue since then, the feud has not abated."

""I'm going to find ways for Congress to continue promoting our two countries mutual defence, including working with QUAD members,"" the top Democrat leader said in his address. ""America is a whole lot better off because of the long strong and crucial friendship between India and the United States,"" Schumer said on Wednesday.

""We will create new opportunities in this century to prosper together, and that Indian Americans are given the full benefits of life in America free of discrimination,"" schemer affirmed. Schumer insisted that the two democracies must continue to strengthen and cooperate on the economic ties. ""This means Congress must find opportunities to invest in the industries, critical to both our countries from biotech and semiconductors and information technology. These are good-paying jobs that strengthen both economies, but we also must work to break new grounds on the technologies that will shape life in the 21st century,"" the Democrat leader asserted.

""At a time when the forces of authoritarianism, are making inroads across the world. It's vital that India and the US, the two large prosperous growing democracies, keep working together to stand up and proudly defend the right of all people to freedom and to equality.""

""I was so proud to stand arm in arm with the Indian American community and so many others and I made sure as Majority Leader, to pass the anti-Asian hate crimes bill this year in the Congress. But no matter how you slice it, hate and discrimination or unAmerican bigotry against one is bigotry against all,"" Schumer added.

Kameswari, a former teacher, is shattered. Her husband Ramesh Subramanian, 48, an MBA who worked as a Project Manager, died in June, less than two months after he was allegedly forced to resign by Synamedia Private Ltd, the company he worked for in Chennai. She has a son. She says her nightmare began on April 8. ""The HR connected with Ramesh on Zoom and told him he had to resign as part of their retrenchment drive,"" she said. Mr Subramanian, she added, ""pleaded with them to allow him to serve the mandatory two-month notice period as given in his appointment order so he could find a new job"". A few days later, the company asked him to put in his papers or face termination, which, it said, would jeopardise his career. He handed in his resignation on April 13, and three days later, he was relieved of his duties. Kameswari says her husband, who earned around ₹ 30 lakh a year, was traumatised after losing his job. Things turned worse after he contracted the virus within a month. Though the family spent ₹ 18 lakh for his treatment, he died on June 11. She argues that if he had been allowed to serve notice, he would have received insurance benefits and the family would have got more than ₹ 1.5 crores. She has sent a legal notice to the company demanding fair compensation. Fighting back tears, she said, ""The company sees only money. What do they lose if they let an employee serve the notice period? Situations like this destroy a family. I don't want this to happen to anyone, that is why I am fighting."" The company has so far come forward to pay only a donation of ₹2 lakh, which the family has not accepted. Mr Subramanian's brother Kishore says many corporates defy the government directive asking employers to not sack employees amid the pandemic. He says his brother was forced to resign. ""If he had resigned on his own without serving the two-month notice, wouldn't the company have asked him to pay two months' salary? My brother was crying, how will I pay my EMIs? We are only demanding what he was deprived of. Why didn't Synamedia let him be on their rolls for two months,"" Kishore Subramanian questioned.   Synamedia denies Mr Subramanian was forced to resign and claims it was he who had quit and asked to be released immediately for a ""a better opportunity."" When asked why the company did not make him pay two months' salary, the company's senior HR person Rajesh Kumaraswamy told NDTV, ""We had taken a kind approach amid the pandemic. We, in fact, had paid four-month salary to him. Perhaps he did not let his family know about his decision to resign."" Denying any retrenchment, Mr Kumaraswamy, however, conceded ""there were many voluntary resignations from our company as many great opportunities opened for them.""

Upon his arrival at the Chandigarh Airport, he spoke to the media at length where he said, ""Whatever is happening in Punjab is very unfortunate. It has been reduced to ""tamasha"". People don't know where to go. The Punjab Chief Minister should fulfill the promises made by Captain Amarinder Singh and act against tainted ministers, MLAs, and officers. The mastermind behind the sacrilege incidents of 2015 should be booked. Only AAP can create a stable govt in Punjab."" Amid speculation that Bhagwat Mann could be CM face for the AAP, when asked to comment on who the CM face of Punjab will be, he very distinctly remarked, ""The CM candidate from Punjab will be someone of your own, someone you will feel proud of."" Upon arriving in Ludhiana, the Chief Minister was scheduled to meet traders and industrialists at the Park Plaza Hotel. Around 250 participated at the event amid tight security. At the meeting, the AAP supremo remarked, addressing the industry body, ""I am not here to seek your support to help my party, in fact, I am here with a proposal that you be my partner. You make the decisions, you run the government. We will help you implement them."" Citing that traders in the country have to go through a lot of hassle and adhere to ""gunda raj"", Mr Kejriwal said, ""What does a trader want? He wants peace. He wants law and order. Punjab is a border state. This state deserves peace and law and order.""   While making promises, a significant one he uttered was, ""Aap promises peace, law, and order in Punjab. AAP will stop inspector raj, gunda tax, dhamkibaaz system,"" reflecting on the issue of national security. Today, the second day of his visit, he will be addressing a press conference at 11 am amid what the party calls 'big announcements' expected. Will it be announcing a CM face? Will it be a joining of someone new to the party? No one knows, except giving rise to one question - in the Punjab leadership crisis that only seems to be mounting, will the main opposition - the AAP cash in? With AAP benefit from this?

""To my knowledge, there was not,"" Austin told a US Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. When asked the same question, Milley replied: ""I have no knowledge of any money that transmitted from any element of the United States government to the Taliban."" Austin informed that the US planned to evacuate between 70,000-80,000 people. ""We evacuated more than 124,000."" ""Not a single [military aircraft] sortie was missed for maintenance, fuel, or logistical problems. It was the largest airlift conducted in U.S. history, and it was executed in just 17 days,"" he added. As we consider these tactical issues today, Austin said the US must also ask ourselves some equally tough questions about the wider war itself, and pause to think about the lessons that we have learned over the past 20 years. The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan after entering the capital Kabul on August 15 that led to the collapse of the US-backed government there. Soon after the Taliban takeover of the capital city, US and coalition forces conducted large-scale evacuation operations from the country.   In a matter of few weeks, thousands of people were evacuated from Afghanistan including foreign nationals and vulnerable Afghan citizens.

Brazilian mining company Vale congratulated rescuers in a statement for ""bringing our 39 employees home safe and healthy."" ""This was tremendous news flowing from very difficult circumstances,"" said company chief executive Eduardo Bartolomeo, who met with miners and rescuers in Sudbury, Ontario. The Canadian province's premier Doug Ford also tweeted his relief that the miners emerged ""safely above ground and uninjured."" Kyle Arcand, on his way home after being freed, told public broadcaster CBC that he and fellow miners had suffered ""a lot of anxiety... because you don't know exactly when you're going to come out, or how long you're going to be down there."" According to a statement from their union, the last of four miners who made their way to the surface on Wednesday exited at 4:45 am local time (0845 GMT). The rescue operation started Monday night. Each miner was medically checked after making the long climb to the surface, and their health will continue to be monitored over the coming days, it said. ""Mining is much safer than it once was,"" local union branch boss Marty Warren commented. ""But miners take a great deal of risk every time they go underground. We must never forget that."" The miners became trapped Sunday afternoon after an accident damaged their transport system, cutting off access to the main exit. Vale said a heavy scoop bucket had detached from and collided with the conveyance system at about 650 feet below the surface, rendering it unusable. Officials described a painstakingly slow process using ropes and ladders to help the miners -- who'd had minimal food and sleep -- climb 3,000 feet up a secondary egress. During the operation, rescue crews made up to four trips per shift up and down to the mine bottom, carrying heavy packs of supplies to the miners. All operations at the Totten mine -- which employs 200 people -- have been halted since Sunday, and Vale says it will conduct an assessment before resuming production. Gilpin said the impact to the mine's operations was ""significant.""   The mine had closed in 1972, but Vale completed refit work and reopened it in 2014. In the first six months of 2021, about 3,600 tons of finished nickel were extracted from it.

The proposed £20 billion ($27 billion, 23 billion euros) plant on the Suffolk coast is currently awaiting a formal investment decision. EDF owns 80 percent of the project and China's state-owned nuclear firm CGN holds the remainder. The FT, citing people briefed on the situation, reported on Wednesday that the UK government and EDF want to force CGN to sell or float its 20-percent stake. In response, a government spokesman told AFP that negotiations were ""ongoing"" but no investment decision has yet been made. EDF declined to comment. The business daily added that ministers are also expected to block CGN's plans for another nuclear plant at Bradwell in Essex, southeast England. UK media had reported in July that Britain was exploring ways to bar CGN from all strategic power projects amid chilling relations between London and Beijing. Relations have become increasingly strained on issues ranging from espionage and cyberattacks to alleged human rights against the Uyghur Muslim minority, and repression in Britain's former colony of Hong Kong. London angered Beijing by last year banning Chinese telecoms group Huawei from involvement in its 5G network after the United States raised spying fears.   CGN is already working alongside France's EDF in the construction of a nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point, in southwest England, which is due to be completed in 2025.

The over 12 hours of polling began around 7 am. The votes will be counted on October 3. The election was necessitated due to the resignation of Ms Banerjee's party leader Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay to make way for her. The Chief Minister has had to contest because, despite her own party's tremendous victory in the Assembly polls held this April-May, she could not win from Nandigram. The BJP put up a tough fight there through its Suvendu Adhikari, a confidant-turned-foe of the Chief Minister. The TMC chief had earlier said that being elected from her home seat was her ""destiny"", according to a PTI report. ""My victory is necessary to continue as chief minister as it is only me who will fight against CAA, NRC, demonetisation and the anti-people policies of BJP,"" she said. The contest may not necessarily be a cakewalk for her despite the fact that she lives there -- her Kalighat residence is located in the constituency -- and that she had won the seat twice, in 2011 and 2016. The BJP has put up 41-year-old Priyanka Tibrewal as a candidate against its arch-rival. Although she lost the recent Assembly polls and also the 2015 municipal polls, the Calcutta High Court lawyer has turned high profile, being one of the petitioners in the post-poll violence case against the state government. The CPM, on the other hand, has fielded another lawyer Srijeeb Biswas. Given the kind of political heat the contest has generated in its run-up, a web of security has been laid over Bhabanipur. Prohibitory orders have been placed 200 metres around polling booths since Tuesday evening, banning more than five people from gathering in the area. Up to 35 companies of Central paramilitary forces have been deployed, with three personnel to be present at each of the 270-odd booths all of which have been declared sensitive. Mitra Institution, a state high school where Ms Banerjee casts her vote, is among the 13 booths declared ""very sensitive"". The Election Commission has asked the state Irrigation Department to be on alert, given the potential for inclement weather conditions, PTI reported. All polling stations have been directed to keep pumps ready to drain out floodwaters, it said.   There are 1,11,283 male and 95,209 female voters in Bhabanipur. There are four belonging to the third gender. Besides Bhabanipur, polls will also be held tomorrow in Shamsherganj and Jangipur in Murshidabad district."

As soon the woman notices the leopard, she tries to push it away with her stick. The next few nerve-wracking seconds show the woman falling back as the leopard tries to pounce on her. Moments later, the leopard retreats. The woman has received minor injuries in the incident and is undergoing treatment. A few people were also seen rushing towards the woman, probably after hearing the woman's calls for help.   Two days ago, a 4-year-old boy was attacked by a leopard. The boy was reportedly playing outside his residence when the leopard tried to dragged him away. The boy was saved after locals rushed to his rescue.

Speaking at a high-level UN event on 'Jobs and Social Protection for Poverty Eradication and a Sustainable Recovery'' on Tuesday, Kailash Satyarthi, the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize winner, gave a clarion call for bold and proactive leadership to end child labour and poverty. He said that USD 52 billion can provide social protection for every child and every pregnant woman in low income countries. ""That is not a big amount. This is just two days of COVID-19 relief measures as well as 0.4% of the social protection fund which is spent in rich countries,"" he said at the virtual event. ""We are not so poor. I refuse to accept that the world is so poor when 2,755 billionaires exist in this world. We have made progress when we didn't have enough resources, we helped children and declined child labour,"" he said, adding that the world of today is much more resourceful in technology and other areas. ""We did it in the past and we will do in the future. There is no dearth of bold ideas. But what we need is bold leadership in all spheres of life... compassion in leadership, courage in leadership and proactive leadership with a sense of urgency,"" he said. Mr Satyarthi noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated all the injustices and inequalities prevailing in the society and the worst sufferers have been the most marginalised children, particularly in developing, low-income and middle-income countries. He pointed out that many more children have been pushed into chronic poverty situations due to the pandemic. These children are out of school, denied health care, have no proper adequate access to safe drinking water or safe, clean air. ""They are the children who are sold and bought like animals and sometimes at lesser prices than animals,"" he said in his impassioned remarks. ""They are the children who are exploited as child labourers and are breaking their backs for our economies,"" he said. Underlining that ""these children are our children,"" Mr Satyarthi cautioned that if nations are not able to protect their children, most of the Sustainable Development Goals will not be accomplished. He voiced worry that even during the pre-pandemic years of 2016-2020, about 10,000 children were pushed into child labour every day. ""There is no excuse for that. There is no justification for that because it was the pre-pandemic time. This is not just apathy and insensitivity of the international community and all of us, including me and you. This is a crime against future of humanity,"" he said. He said the 160 million child labourers are ""160 million empty seats in the classrooms"" and these are children who are ""occupying 160 million jobs of adults."" Mr Satyarthi noted that even if the spending on education is adequate, ""nobody can bring these children to school"" untill additional efforts are made in freeing them from the ""clutches of their masters."" He underlined that social protection programmes will be successful especially for the children when ""we take swift and direct measures so that these children could be benefitted directly. Only then they will be freed from these situations."" According to the concept note of event, which was addressed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and several other world leaders and top UN officials, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to serve as a harsh reminder of the perils stemming from global inequities and a reminder of the urgency to redouble efforts towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda. ""The equivalent of an unprecedented 255 million jobs were lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to a sharp increase in poverty and inequalities. Declining labour income has been distributed unevenly between workers, with youth, women and low-skilled workers seeing the sharpest drops in disposable income,"" the concept note said. The High-Level event included a policy discussion to frame the ambitions needed for a socio-economic recovery to advance decent job creation, social protection and poverty eradication.   The event focussed on pressing issues including application of effective economic, social and environmental policies at country level through dialogue with social partners and other stakeholders; global norms and standards underpinning the socio-economic recovery and a just transition and current efforts to achieve just transitions in the context of ambitious climate action and the COVID-19 recovery and solutions that support accelerating and scaling up these efforts, particularly in developing countries.

""Due to the currency price instability at the moment...all Northern Breeze Exchange Service branches are temporarily closed,"" the money changer said on Facebook. Those still operating were quoting a rate of 2,700 kyat per dollar on Tuesday, compared to 1,695 on September 1 and 1,395 back on February 1, when the military overthrew a democratically elected government led by Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. In a report published on Monday, the World Bank predicted the economy would slump by 18% this year, partly due to the pandemic, saying that Myanmar would see the biggest contraction in employment in the region, and that the number of poor people in the country would rise. The increasing economic pressures come amid signs of an upsurge in bloodshed, as armed militias have become bolder in clashes with the army after months of protests and strikes by opponents of the junta. ""The worse the political situation is, the worse the currency rate will be,"" said a senior executive at a Myanmar bank, who declined to be named. Myanmar is also struggling to deal with a second wave of coronavirus cases that started in June with the response by authorities crippled after many health workers joined protests. Reported cases have comes off their highs, though the true extent of the outbreak remains unclear. Stay-at-home orders in some townships have been withdrawn, but are still in effect in some areas. In the immediate months after the February 1 coup, many people queued up to withdraw savings from banks and some bought gold, but a jewellery merchant in Yangon said many desperate people were now trying to sell their gold back. The central bank gave no reason to why it abandoned its managed float strategy earlier this month, but analysts believe its foreign currency reserves must be seriously depleted. Central bank officials did not answer calls seeking comment on how much foreign currency was left, but World Bank data shows it had just $7.67 billion in reserves at the end of 2020. After coming off its managed float, the central bank still spent $65 million, buying kyat at a rate of 1,750 to 1,755 per dollar between Sept 13-27. The bank executive said the central bank's efforts had limited impact in a currency market shorn of confidence. The economic crisis has driven up the price of staples, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said this week that around three million people now require humanitarian assistance in Myanmar, up from one million before the coup. A 48-kilogram bag of rice costs 48,000 kyat, up nearly 40% since the coup, while gasoline prices have nearly doubled to 1,445 kyat per litre. The crisis is also hurting businesses, particularly those needing to import raw materials. A plastic bag manufacturer in Yangon said he had been forced to increase prices and sales had dropped about 30%. Per capita gross domestic product was just $1,400 last year, and Zaw, a resident in Yangon who asked to use only part of his name, was under no illusion about where Myanmar was heading.   ""People will become poorer,"" he stated. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

The long-range FH-97 drone concept unveiled on Wednesday can carry different types of weapons, and has swarm and electronic warfare capabilities, said Wu Wei, a representative of China Aerospace Science Technology Corp's (CASTC) Feihong product line. He did not provide specifics in his presentation at Airshow China in Zhuhai. The United States, Britain, Australia, India and Russia are among the countries developing ""loyal wingman"" drones, which are cheaper and more expendable than crewed fighters. CASTC did not provide technical details of the FH-97 concept, nor say whether it was planned for export, though many foreign observers watched the presentation. The FH-97's appearance is nearly identical to the Kratos XQ-58A, which made its first flight in 2019. The XQ-58A has a maximum speed of Mach 0.85 and a range of about 2,200 nautical miles. Zhang Zhongyang, vice president of CASTC said the plan was to turn Feihong into an ""international top-notch brandnd become a major player at the centre stage of the world arena."" China has exported military drones to countries including the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and Serbia. ""The chief customer is certainly the PLA, but in recent years the Chinese are also aggressively marketing these systems for exports,"" said Collin Koh, a defence research fellow with Singapore's Rajaratnam School of International Studies. China also used the country's biggest air show to display the weapons capability of one of its most advanced stealth attack drone projects, the GJ-11. The Global Times reported that the GJ-11 on display at the show had its two weapons bays open for the first time. Inside each were four unidentified munitions that appeared to be precision air-to-ground glide bombs. Bradley Perrett, a specialist on Asian aerospace and defence, said the GJ-11 was designed to slip undetected through radar coverage and attack heavily defended targets. ""In doing that, it would take the place of a much larger and more expensive fighter with a pilot,"" he said. ""Development won't be easy, but when it's complete the type will present a new threat to Taiwan and potentially Japan.""   Chinese companies have 27 drone exhibits at the Zhuhai show.

Across the country, motorists waited in long lines to fill up their vehicles. One big distributor said it was rationing sales and a number of operators said they were having to close some forecourts, provoking panic-buying. Government ministers and oil companies say there are ample stocks of petrol or diesel and there is no cause for alarm, but the lack of truck drivers is hampering transport of fuel from refineries to gas stations. With retailers also warning of significant disruption to their supplies in the run-up to Christmas, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office has said it is looking at a short-term fix to address the shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers. ""We're looking at temporary measures to avoid any immediate problems, but any measures we introduce will be very strictly time limited,"" a spokeswoman for Johnson's Downing Street office said in a statement. ""Like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary COVID-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country."" The UK's Road Haulage Association (RHA) says Britain is facing a shortage of some 100,000 drivers, a result of workers leaving the industry, Brexit and COVID-19, which put a stop to driver training and testing for about a year. Newspapers have reported that the government would allow up to 5,000 foreign drivers into Britain on short-term visas, a measure that logistics companies and retailers have demanded for months but which the government had previously ruled out. Business leaders and the haulage industry have welcomed the reported plan, but there are also doubts about whether it will go far enough, or if drivers will come to Britain from Europe where countries are also facing labour shortages. ""We'll have to see if we can attract people for a short period of time,"" Huw Merriman, chairman of parliament's transport committee, told BBC TV. Brian Madderson, the chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association which represents independent fuel retailers, said he expected the problem to continue for a ""while longer"". ""I think this situation is going to get worse before it gets better,"" he told Sky News. UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND The issue came to the fore after BP said it had to close some of its outlets due to the driver shortages, with Shell and ExxonMobil's Esso also reporting problems with supplies to gas stations. EG Group, which runs 341 forecourts across Britain, said on Friday it would impose a purchase limit of 30 pounds ($41) per customer for fuel due to the ""unprecedented customer demand"". From early on Saturday, motorists began queuing outside filling stations and some forecourts closed as fuel ran out. ""I was out on my bike ... and came past my BP garage and it was chaos,"" Merriman said. ""As soon as the message gets out there might be a fuel shortage, people understandably react."" Police across the country reported congestion caused by motorists waiting in line, and urged people not to contact them about the problems the traffic was causing. Britain, the world's fifth-largest economy, is also grappling with a spike in European natural gas costs causing soaring energy prices and a potential food supply crunch.   Britain says the long-term solution for the haulage industry is for more British drivers to be hired and for them to be paid better.

The announcement came via the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which proposed to remove the birds, mussels, fish, as well as a plant and fruit bat from Endangered Species Act protections because government scientists have given up on ever finding them again. ""With climate change and natural area loss pushing more and more species to the brink, now is the time to lift up proactive, collaborative, and innovative efforts to save America's wildlife,"" said interior secretary Deb Haaland in a statement. Perhaps the most iconic of the species was the Ivory-billed woodpecker, with the last indisputable evidence of its existence coming in the 1940s. Noted for its striking black-and-white plumage, pointed crest and lemon-yellow eye, it has been something of Holy Grail for birders in recent decades, with numerous unconfirmed sightings over the years in the southeastern US. ""The fundamental thing that drove the woodpecker down to near extinction was the loss of the southeastern first growth forests, which really started taking place after the Civil War,"" John Fitzpatrick, director emeritus of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, told AFP. Fitzpatrick was part of efforts to search for the bird in Arkansas and other regions in the mid-2000s -- but added that, while he agreed with the government about its decision regarding the other bird species, he believed there is still hope for the woodpecker. ""Every decade there have been reasonably credible reports coming out of the US, and in the 1980s out of Cuba, that it still existed,"" he said. The species was revered not just by Alexander Wilson and John James Audobon, considered the founding fathers of ornithology, but also by collectors who hunted them. Its nickname, ""Lord God Bird,"" was said to be derived from the expression ""Lord God, what a bird,"" said Fitzpatrick. Other species declared extinct include Bachman's warbler, a songbird last documented in Cuba in 1981, and eight species of freshwater mussel, which rely on healthy streams and clean reliable water. Eleven species from Hawai'i and Guam are included in the list, including the Kauai akialoa and nukupu'u, known for their long, curved beaks, and Kauai 'o'o that was said to have a haunting call. Also lost was San Marcos gambusia, a freshwater fish from Texas last spotted in 1983. Climate pressure Despite the sad news, Fitzpatrick said there was some cause for optimism. Since it was enacted in 1973, the Endangered Species Act has prevented the extinction of 99 percent of plants and animals under its care. These include bird species like the whooping crane, which numbered as few as 16 individuals in the 1940s but have since recovered to 500 or 600. On the other hand, today's endangered species also have to contend with the pressures of climate change. Saltmarsh sparrows for example live in coastal marshes that are being rapidly disrupted by sea level rise. Tiera Curry, a senior scientist for the Center for Biological Diversity, praised President Joe Biden's administration for requesting a hefty $60 million increase in endangered species protections, but criticized the fact a new FWS director had yet to be appointed.   ""Extinction is not inevitable. It is a political choice. Saving species isn't rocket science. As a country we need to stand up and say we aren't going to lose any more species to extinction,"" she said.

Under the new excise policy of the Delhi government, all the 850 liquor vends, including the 260-odd outlets that run privately, have been given to private firms through open tender. The new licence holders will start retail sale of liquor in the city from November 17. In the transition period of nearly one-and-half months, only government-run liquor vends will remain open. The government vends will close down on November 16. ""There are already problems in getting one's favourite brands since the private liquor store in my neighbourhood has depleted its stock as it is wrapping up business. Permanent closure of private shops means more problems,"" said a Laxmi Nagar resident, Dhiraj Kumar. An excise department official said that the government vends have been asked to stock up in view of an expected surge in demand. ""It's a transition phase and some people may have problems but there will be no shortage as there are adequate number of government vends to cater to the demand,"" the officer said. There are around 720 operating liquor vends, out of which nearly 260 or 40 per cent are privately run, he said. The department has also prepared to check the possibility of illicit liquor entering the city from neighbouring states due to closure of private shops. There are 26 municipal wards in the city where no liquor shop will open after September 30 as they were catered to by private vends only. There are already 80 wards where there are no liquor vends. The Delhi government under its new excise policy divided the city into 32 zones and bid the liquor vends there aiming an equitable distribution of retail liquor business across the city. Each zone comprising 8-10 wards will have around 27 vends.     (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

Its expansion is the need of the hour because people are looking for an alternative, its spokesperson said. This seemingly confident stance came amid the Trinamool's recent ventures into the northeast and Goa, among other states. The party, according to its newest Rajya Sabha MP Sushmita Dev, feels its leader Mamata Banerjee offers a whole bunch of qualities and ideological stands that most of the voters opposed to the BJP are today looking for. ""Mamata Banerjee's face counts. She stands for credibility. She stands for good governance. She stands for inclusive politics. All of which the anti-BJP vote-bank wants,"" Ms Dev, who left the Congress and joined the Trinamool a little over a month ago, told NDTV in an exclusive interview. ""Of course, you can't take electoral politics for granted. Things can go wrong. We are very very optimistic and confident that...we will help in every way to block the Bharatiya Janata Party,"" she said. Ms Dev, daughter of former Congress leader Santosh Mohan Dev, was yesterday declared elected unopposed to the Rajya Sabha from West Bengal. She is a former Lok Sabha MP from Silchar, Assam. The Trinamool leader pointed out two political dynamics: The BJP doesn't have a presence in every state. And then there are some states in which the BJP is in a direct fight with the Congress party. ""On the other hand, there are many states where the Congress is absolutely nowhere. For a few examples...Odisha, they are finished, they are zero. Tripura, they are nowhere. In most of the northeast states, they are nowhere. And the latest addition is Assam,"" Ms Dev said. ""The question is somebody has to fill up that vacuum, for two reasons: It is politically the need of the hour and, two, people want an alternative."" So, she raised the question, how is all of this going to come together and pan out ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election? Answering the question from her party's viewpoint, Ms Dev said it will focus on the state polls in 2022 and 2023 first. ""I can only speak for All India Trinamool Congress. They are going (to some poll-bound states) after doing proper surveys, knowing that wherever they are going, they can block the BJP and not harm the other opposition,"" Ms Dev said.   ""I can't reveal too much. But we have done our homework and we will be a force to reckon with (in Goa). We have been in a dialogue with people for several months,"" she said, fully appreciating the Aam Admi Party also venturing into the coastal state. When asked if the Congress party was still in opposition as a political force, she said a lot depends on who is going to be the face of the opposition in that state."

Amit Shah, the party said, is furious that a Dalit has been chosen as Chief Minister and is keen on revenge on Punjab. Of Mr Singh -- who stepped down from the post of Punjab Chief Minister earlier this month after a long and bitter feud with a section of his MLAs -- nothing overt was said. But the thrust of the message left little doubt about the party's stance regarding the veteran leader, whose meeting with Amit Shah set off speculation about his joining the BJP camp. ""The arrogance of the abbot sitting in power has been hurt,"" senior Congress leader and party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted. ""Because if a Dalit is made the Chief Minister, they ask who is making decisions in the Congress? They do not like the top position being given to a Dalit. The center of anti-Dalit politics is located in Amit Shah's residence,"" read his tweet in Hindi. In another tweet, he added, ""Amit Shah and Modi are vengeful towards Punjab. They want revenge because they have so far failed to serve the interests of their capitalist cronies with the black anti-farmer laws. The BJP's anti-farmer conspiracy will not succeed"". With the tweet, he attached the hashtag #NoFarmersNoFood, which was also used by Amarinder Singh. Amid much speculation this evening, Amarinder Singh had said he discussed farmers' issues with Mr Shah. Under the hashtag #NoFarmersNoFood, he tweeted, ""Met Union Home Minister Amit Shah ji in Delhi. Discussed the prolonged farmers' agitation against Farm Laws and urged him to resolve the crisis urgently with repeal of the laws and guarantee MSP, besides supporting Punjab in crop diversification"". While stepping down earlier this month, Mr Singh – who had been with the Congress for more than four decades and has been its biggest mass leader in Punjab – made it clear that he would look for options. Asked whether he would stay in the Congress or form a new party ahead of next year's state elections, Mr Singh said, ""There is always an option, and I will use that option when the time comes"". He had also said he would decide on his future course of action after discussions with ""friends"".   The turbulence in Punjab had repercussions for the Congress leadership, with dissidents renewing their call for sweeping changes.

Under the agreement, Airbus will deliver the first 16 aircraft in ''fly-away condition from its final assembly line in Seville, Spain, within four years. The subsequent 40 aircraft will be manufactured and assembled by Tata Advanced Systems (TASL) in India under a partnership between the two companies and all the deliveries will be made by 2031."

Congress workers from Chandni Chowk, the constituency that Mr Sibal represented in Lok Sabha in the past, also protested outside his residence holding placards with ""Get well soon"" message. They raised slogans against Mr Sibal alleging that he never bothered to ask about the people who elected him in the past. The ripples of the turmoil in the Congress' Punjab unit reached Delhi as Mr Sibal lashed out at the party leadership and demanded that an immediate meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) be convened. Mr Maken alleged that leaders like Mr Sibal are demoralising the party cadres who have stood by the Congress ideology. He said it was Sonia Gandhi, the current Congress president, who made him a union minister though he did not have any organisational background and experience. ""My appeal to Mr Sibal and others like him is that they should not denigrate the organisation which has given them political identity by rushing to the media every then and now,"" Mr Maken told PTI. ""Such remarks by leaders like Sibal, who have got everything from the organisation and the leadership, demoralise the party cadres and ordinary workers who continue to stand with the Congress ideology and are fighting the fundamental and fascist forces on the streets,"" he said. Earlier, addressing the media, Sibal, who is a part of the ''Group of 23'' that had written to Sonia Gandhi last year demanding an organisational overhaul, wondered who in the party was taking decisions in the absence of a full-time president. He said the grouping is ""not a Jee Huzur 23"" and will continue to put forth the views and will continue to repeat the demands.   Mr Maken rejected Mr Sibal's contention about Congress having no regular president, saying Sonia Gandhi continues to lead the party. ""The meeting of the CWC and that of party general secretaries have been held at least half a dozen times in the last few months, taking important decision of the party, where everyone has been given full opportunity to air their views,"" the former union minister said."

""Our embassy staff in the UAE has been working around the clock to verify the accuracy of the passenger manifest and is coordinating with DHS/Customs and Border Protection on the ground to ensure the passengers are screened and vetted before they are permitted to fly to the United States,"" a State Department spokesperson said. ""We expect the passengers to continue onward travel tomorrow morning,"" the spokesperson added. Bryan Stern, a founder of the nonprofit group Project Dynamo, said late on Tuesday that the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection agency was blocking a charter on an international flight into a U.S. port of entry. Stern spoke to Reuters from aboard a plane that his group chartered from Kam Air, a private Afghan airline, that he said had been sitting for 14 hours at the Abu Dhabi airport in the United Arab Emirates after arriving from Afghanistan's capital Kabul with 117 people, including 59 children, aboard. The group is one of several that emerged from ad hoc networks of U.S. military veterans, current and former U.S. officials and others that formed to bolster last month's U.S. evacuation operation they viewed as chaotic and badly organized. ""All U.S.-bound flights must follow the established safety, security and health protocols before they are cleared for departure,"" a DHS spokesperson said. ""This process requires flight manifests to be verified before departure to the U.S. to ensure all passengers are screened appropriately."" President Joe Biden's administration has said its top priority is repatriating Americans and lawful permanent residents - known as green card holders - who were unable to leave Afghanistan in the U.S. evacuation operation last month. Twenty-eight Americans, 83 green card holders and six people with U.S. Special Immigration Visas granted to Afghans who worked for the U.S. government during the 20-year war in Afghanistan were aboard the Kam Air flight, Stern said. Stern had planned to transfer the passengers to a chartered Ethiopian Airlines plane for an onward flight to the United States that he said the customs agency cleared to land at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The agency then changed the clearance to Dulles International Airport outside Washington before denying the plane landing rights anywhere in the United States, Stern said. ""I have a big, beautiful, giant, humongous Boeing 787 that I can see parked in front of us,"" Stern said. ""I have crew. I have food.""   Stern said intermediaries in Kabul had obtained permission from the Taliban-run Afghan Civil Aviation Authority for the groups to send a charter flight to retrieve the passengers from Kabul airport.

Based on a tip-off about Singh's location, members of the Ahmedabad crime branch team stayed in Vasai near Mumbai for nearly a month and kept a close watch on his movements. The police personnel even worked as watchmen and cleaners at a residential society in three shifts, a release by the crime branch said. Singh, 37, was finally caught on Tuesday and brought to Ahmedabad today, it said. Singh - a ""most wanted"" criminal in Uttar Pradesh - carried a ₹ 50,000 bounty on his head. A native of UP's Varanasi, Singh was on the run and kept evading arrest ever since he escaped from the UP police's custody in 2009, it added. He is wanted in nearly 20 cases in different states, including 15 in UP and three in Gujarat. He was charged for serious offences, like murder, attempt to murder and under the Arms Act for providing firearms to other criminals. In 2014, three FIRs related to murder, criminal conspiracy, and under the Arms Act were registered against Singh in Gujarat. The most sensational case was related to the murder of two persons inside the office of a petrol pump in Gujarat. Bharatsinh Vala and Ranchhod Patel were shot dead by three persons over some old enmity. The police were looking for Singh after investigation revealed that he had provided revolvers and pistols to the three accused in the case, who were arrested by the police at that time.   Singh committed his first criminal offence in 2007 when he fired nearly 12 rounds on a person in Varanasi to establish his dominance. He came under the UP police's lens after the murder of businessman RK Singh. It was alleged that Manish Singh took the contract to kill the businessman from his business rivals, said the release. After his escape in 2009, Singh went to Mumbai and allegedly threatened a bar owner for money. When the bar owner Krishna Shetty refused, Singh and other members of the Subhash Singh Thakur gang fired on Shetty. Singh is wanted in that case too, the release said."

Twenty-two Republican senators on Tuesday introduced the legislation in the Senate to impose sanctions on the Taliban in Afghanistan and on all the foreign governments that support the hardline Islamic group that seized power in Kabul. The ''Afghanistan Counterterrorism, Oversight and Accountability Act'' also seeks a report from the Secretary of State about his assessment of Pakistan's role in supporting the Taliban from 2001-2020, in the offensive that led to the toppling of the Government of Afghanistan and looking into the Pakistan support for Taliban offensive against Panjshir Valley and Afghan resistance. Today, Pakistan said that the reference made towards the country in the legislation introduced in the US congress was ""unwarranted"". In response to media queries about the draft bill introduced by US Senators, the Foreign Office said in Islamabad that the draft legislation seems to be a reaction to the debate that is underway in Washington both in the media and on Capitol Hill to reflect on and examine the circumstances leading to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. ""The legislation includes references to Pakistan that are completely unwarranted. We find all such references inconsistent with the spirit of Pakistan-US cooperation on Afghanistan since 2001, including facilitation of the Afghan peace process and during the recent evacuations of American and other nationals from Afghanistan,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement. It said Pakistan consistently maintained that there was no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and a coercive approach would not work, adding that the only way to achieve long-term sustainable peace in Afghanistan was through engagement and dialogue. Moreover, sustained security cooperation between Pakistan and the United States would remain critical in dealing with any future terrorist threat in the region, said the Pakistan Foreign Office. It went to declare the proposed legislative measures as ""uncalled for and counterproductive"". The Taliban swept across Afghanistan last month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities in the backdrop of withdrawal of the US forces that began on May 1. On August 15, the capital city of Kabul fell to the insurgents. The Taliban claimed victory over opposition forces in the last holdout province of Panjshir on September 6, completing their takeover of Afghanistan three weeks after capturing Kabul.

""I have high levels of antibodies, thank God I got lucky,"" Putin told Erdogan in his palm tree-lined residence. ""So next time you get vaccinated again (use) Sputnik,"" Putin said in remarks broadcast on state television. Erdogan said he had already had a Pfizer booster jab and had an antibody level of 1,100.

Earlier this month the 68-year-old Kremlin chief spent two weeks in self-isolation after dozens of cases were detected in his inner circle. On Wednesday, Russia recorded 857 new coronavirus fatalities, its highest coronavirus deaths for a second day running, as infections rise driven by the Delta variant and slow vaccination rates. The new figure brought the country's total deaths from Covid-19 to 206,388 -- the highest in Europe. Authorities have been accused of downplaying the severity of the outbreak. Several Russian vaccines including Sputnik have been available for months, but authorities have struggled to inoculate a vaccine-sceptic population.   As of Wednesday, just under 30 percent of the Russian population had been fully vaccinated, according to the Gogov website, which tallies Covid data from the regions.

He made the promise alleging that the BJP-led central government is fighting shy of conducting it, fearing that the caste census in the country will lead to the backward classes of people demanding their rights and due respect after this. ""The BJP government at the Centre does not want to conduct caste census as it knows that backwards will demand their right and due respect after it. This is the biggest demand of backwards and Dalits,"" Akhilesh Yadav said in a statement. Promising caste census in Uttar Pradesh if his party is voted to power in 2022 assembly polls, Akhilesh Yadav said, ""We will ensure that backwards get their rights."" Alleging that the crime rate in UP has grown exponentially, Akhilesh Yadav said, ""The chief minister lies on the matter of crime and does not have any information on the NCRB data.” “The highest number of crimes against women is committed in UP,” he asserted. He also reiterated his charge that veteran SP leader Azam Khan is being kept in jail in false cases. ""Azam Khan has been kept in jail in fake cases,” he said, adding maximum custodial deaths in the state have occurred during the present BJP regime. “The CM visits his home district Gorakhpur regularly but crime is rising there,” he alleged, adding police beat up a Kanpur businessman, visiting there, to death. “Even saints are not safe in UP where over 40 sadhu and saints have been killed,"" he said. Terming the governance in UP “a complete failure"", Akhilesh said, ""Common men are not heard. The BJP MLAs and MPs have to face the people's opposition in their own areas."" He said the Centre is on a privatisation spree and if everything will be privatised, there will be no need of implementing reservation. On the Covid vaccination drive, he asked, ""Why do the vaccination certificates not carry the photograph of the national flag?"" He said the government should withdraw three farm laws as it would help business houses take away farmers' land.   ""The farmers will teach a lesson to the BJP in the coming assembly polls,"" he predicted. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

Dr Prathap C Reddy, Chairman of Apollo Hospitals Group, said tools for physicians to understand the probability of their patients developing heart disease are mostly based on Western data sets and don't take regional risk variations into account. ""This impacts their accuracy when applied in an Indian context. The Apollo AI-powered Cardiovascular Disease Risk tool will change that and put the knowledge and the means to predict and prevent heart disease for Indians in the physician's hands,'' Dr Reddy said. Not just Apollo's doctors, the AICVD risk score tool is being made available to all government and private doctors. ""We are happy to share it with the government for its use on a large scale for the country to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in the future,'' said Sangita Reddy, joint managing director of Apollo Hospitals group. Most risk score tools for heart disease take into account information such as blood pressure, diabetes level, dyslipidemia (good and bad fats), smoking history and stress. The tool developed by Apollo Hospitals has also factored in over 20 local parameters. ""For example, chewing tobacco is prevalent only in India and a few other countries such as Malaysia. That has been brought in,"" says Dr Keren Priyadarshini, who looks after Microsoft's healthcare initiatives. Dr J Shiv Kumar, who has headed the effort to develop what he calls an ""atmanirbhar"" tool, said its algorithms are based on 10 years of anonymised data of about 4,00,000 individuals across the country collected by the Apollo Hospitals team. ""We used Microsoft Azure to turn that anonymised data into actionable insights that data scientists and clinicians could use to train machine learning models. The tool has been validated using data from the Maastricht Study, a long-term cohort health study in the Maastricht region and from the Heart+Vascular Center at Maastricht University Medical Center, Netherlands, '' Dr Kumar said. ""The accuracy in predicting disease over 10 years could be to the extent of nearly 90 per cent,'' he added. There are three risk categories -- high, moderate and minimal. The tool also gives insights on risk contributors that can be modified to improve the score. ""If you are in the high-risk category, you could repeat the risk score assessment every 3-6 months to know if the changes you have made have helped you progress or you have regressed,'' Dr Kumar explained. ""You can get your risk assessment done by paying ₹ 200 at Apollo, elsewhere too, the doctor's charges may be added, but we are sharing with them free of cost. They can access it by sending details to infoaicvd@apollohospitals.com,'' Ms Reddy said. Dr Prathap Reddy thanked the Prime Minister for the recently-announced Digital Health Mission and said the nation's economy is intricately linked to the health of the people. Non-communicable diseases are estimated to account for an economic burden of 5% to 10% of GDP and cardiovascular disease tops the list, Dr Reddy said. ""Indians are genetically more predisposed and vulnerable to heart disease; India is the diabetes capital of the world. Though non-modifiable factors cannot be controlled, risk can be reduced by working on modifiable risk factors,"" said Dr Kumar. Prof Rishi Sethi of Lucknow's King George Medical University said that a retrospective study on 1300 -1400 patients under 40, who suffered acute heart disease, showed that applying the AI-powered tool's risk score would have given much greater accuracy in predicting disease than any existing tool.   Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death not just in the Asia Pacific, but across the globe, except in Africa, said Dr Azhar Ali, managing partner of Forth Medical Group, Scotland. He added that the advantage of the new tool was that it could be adapted for any population as per local risk factors. "

Workers of the Youth Congress also raised slogans of ""Leave the party! Come to your senses!"" and ""Rahul Gandhi Zindabad!"" Mr Sibal had earlier called the media and raised a series of questions against the backdrop of the Congress's Punjab meltdown. ""In the Congress there is no elected president now. Who is taking calls? We don't know who is taking decisions in the party,"" he had said. ""We are G-23, definitely not Ji Huzoor-23. We will keep raising issues,"" said Mr Sibal, shooting punches at the Gandhis without naming them. After the protests by his own party workers, Mr Sibal told NDTV: ""I don't get rattled with this drama , I have been very careful in what I have said."" The Gandhis have often been accused of ignoring advice from anyone outside their inner circle, at a huge cost to the party. ""Ji Huzoor (yes, boss)"" was a dig at this alleged coterie. The charge has often been spotlighted by the G-23 or Group of 23 letter writers who had written to Sonia Gandhi calling for sweeping changes in the organization and its leadership. In Punjab, with an election just four months away, a series of disastrous decisions saw Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra backing Navjot Singh Sidhu versus stalwart Amarinder Singh, who subsequently quit as Chief Minister and accused the party of humiliating him thrice. Yesterday, Mr Sidhu stunned his bosses by quitting as Punjab Congress chief, barely two months after taking charge, leaving the party further adrift in a poll-bound state where it was in a strong position even months ago. ""Punjab is a border state. Pakistan exploits the situation,"" said Mr Sibal, echoing Amarinder Singh's criticism of the party for handing the reins of Punjab to Mr Sidhu. Amarinder Singh met with Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday, fuelling massive speculation that he was on the verge of a switch. On record, however, the Captain said the meeting was on the farm law protests. In recent weeks, the Congress has lost leaders like Sushmita Deb and Luizinho Faleiro to the Trinamool Congress. The nosebleed started when Jyotiraditya Scindia, one of Rahul Gandhi's closest confidantes, switched to the BJP last year. Earlier this year, Jitin Prasada followed and is now a minister in the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. In Rajasthan, the party is living with the threat of the Ashok Gehlot versus Sachin Pilot feud exploding any time. Even as Mr Sibal addressed the media this afternoon, Mr Faleiro, a veteran Goa leader, was being welcomed aboard by the Trinamool Congress in Kolkata. ""Why are people leaving? Maybe we should see whether it is our fault? We have to immediately call a CWC (Congress Working Committee), at least so a dialogue can take place. We won't leave the ideology of the party and go anywhere else. The irony of the Congress is that the chosen ones, those who are close to them (Gandhis) have left and those who they think are not close to them are still there,"" Mr Sibal said. ""We won't leave the ideology of the party or go anywhere else. The Congress is the only party that can save this republic because the present dispensation is destroying the foundations of our republic."" The ""G-23"" wrote an unprecedented letter last year to Sonia Gandhi asking for a ""visible and effective leadership"". Since then, various leaders have reminded the Gandhis that nothing has changed on the ground and the Congress down spiral continues in state after state. On Wednesday, a second letter was written by Ghulam Nabi Azad to Mrs Gandhi calling for a CWC to discuss the election of a full-time Congress president. ""I am really very, very upset that I have to come to you. But we have no choice. I can't see the Congress in this situation,"" Mr Sibal told reporters.   Congress leaders said workers went to Mr Sibal's house on their own as they ""were hurt"" by his comments. Youth Congress chief Srinivas BV said on Twitter, ""Listen ''Ji-Huzoor'' :- The ''President'' and ''Leadership'' of the party are the same, who always ensured your entry in Parliament, made you a 'minister' during the good times of the party, when in opposition, ensured your entry into Rajya Sabha, always rewarded with responsibilities in good and bad times.

The disappearance of Sarah Everard during a national lockdown in March was one of Britain's most high-profile missing person investigations and sparked protests and a debate about women's safety on the streets. Wayne Couzens, 48, who served with the elite diplomatic protection unit of London's Metropolitan Police, admitted her kidnapping, rape and murder in July. Everard, who had been visiting a friend in Clapham, south London, was strangled then set on fire, with her remains found in woodland. At a two-day sentencing hearing, prosecutor Tom Little said Couzens targeted the 33-year-old marketing executive on March 3, and accused her of breaking coronavirus rules. Couzens, who was off-duty, kidnapped Everard in a ""false arrest"", by ""handcuffing her and showing his warrant card"", he added. Security camera footage showed him holding up his warrant card and then handcuffing Everard before putting her into a hire car. A couple driving past in a car also witnessed this, and assumed an undercover police officer was making an arrest, the lawyer added. But he said Couzens exploited his knowledge and experience of police patrols enforcing lockdown restrictions and knew what language to use. A former boyfriend had given evidence that Everard was ""savvy and streetwise"" and would not have got into a car with a stranger except ""by force or manipulation"", he added. Couzens sat in the dock at London's Old Bailey with his head bowed, watched by members of Everard's family, as the judge considered whether to hand him a whole-life jail term. The sentence was due to be announced on Thursday. Before the hearing, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement: ""We are sickened, angered and devastated by this man's crimes, which betray everything we stand for."" The force has sacked the officer and said his actions ""raise many questions and concerns"" but it would not comment further until after the sentencing. Demonstrators outside the court held banners with slogans criticising the police such as ""Met Police Blood On Your Hands"" and let off smoke flares. The government has pledged to improve legislation after Everard's murder sparked widespread anger at women's lack of safety in public spaces. In July, the interior ministry said it would increase the currently low numbers of perpetrators brought to justice for offences including rape, domestic abuse, stalking and sexual harassment and work with police to ""more effectively respond to street harassment"".   Yet in another high profile case, primary school teacher Sabina Nessa was murdered earlier this month as she walked through a London park to meet a friend.

Several world leaders expressed their gratitude to India and other nations for the help provided through exports of vaccines and other critical medical supplies in their national statements at the 76th UNGA session's General Debate that ran through September 21-27. Suriname President Chandrikapersad Santokhi, in his address, expressed his sincere gratitude to the countries and organisations ""who expressed solidarity and had provided valuable support to my country and people in the battle against this pandemic, at a very early stage."" ""Our thanks extend especially to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, India, China and also the USA,"" Santokhi said. Nauru President Lionel Rouwen Aingimea said his country's efforts to respond to COVID-19 and vaccinate its people ""would not have been possible without the valuable support provided by our partners. We are truly grateful to our genuine friends Australia, India, Japan and Republic of China (Taiwan), for their ongoing assistance."" Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari said Abuja remains grateful for the assistance received from its partners and friends all over the world. ""Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided,"" Buhari said. Prime Minister of Saint Lucia Philip Pierre said the ""insidious"" nature of the coronavirus has allowed it to sneak across even the most heavily patrolled borders, and Saint Lucia has experienced waves of highs and lows in managing this pandemic. ""We extend our deepest gratitude to international institutions such as the COVAX Facility, and our many bilateral partners such as India and the United States of America, for their commitment to ensuring that we in Saint Lucia and by extension the Caribbean region, were not further disadvantaged by our inability to access vaccines,"" he said. India will resume the export of surplus COVID-19 vaccines in the fourth quarter of 2021 under the 'Vaccine Maitri' programme and meet its commitment to the COVAX global pool. COVAX is a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the World Health Organization. The Indian government had stopped the export of COVID-19 vaccines after the second wave of the pandemic hit the country in April this year. India has exported over 66 million vaccine doses to nearly 100 countries through grants, commercial shipments and the COVAX facility. Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Ralph Gonsalves said it is ""timely to remind all of us that the noblest form of solidarity is to give not from the abundance or surplus that we may have but from the little that we possess; that is the lesson of the proverbial widow's mite."" ""On behalf of the Caribbean, I thank the government of the Republic of India for their early, and meaningful gift of Covishield Astrazeneca vaccines. Sadly, at least one country in the North Atlantic has refused to recognise Covishield for entry of persons into that country,"" Gonsalves said. He was referring to the Serum Institute of India manufactured vaccine that was not included in the list of eligible COVID-19 vaccines recognised under the UK's new international travel norms. Ghana had also termed as ""unfortunate"" the development in ""some countries in Europe"" of not recognising the Covishield vaccine manufactured in India for travellers. ""One unfortunate development appears to be the recent measures on entry into some countries in Europe, which suggest that Covishield, the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India, is not recognised by these countries,"" President of Ghana Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo said. ""What is intriguing is the fact that this vaccine was donated to African countries through the COVAX facility. The use of vaccines as a tool for immigration control will be a truly retrogressive step,"" he had said. Prime Minister of Fiji Josaia Bainimarama said after one full year with zero local COVID cases, the ""insidious"" Delta variant crept into the country and sparked a deadly second outbreak. ""After a slow start, while we scrambled to acquire enough vaccines, we are winning the battle. Over 98 per cent of adults across our 110 populated islands have one jab of the vaccine, and more than 67 per cent are fully vaccinated. We thank India, Australia, New Zealand and the United States for helping us secure the doses we needed,"" he said. Dominica's Minister for Foreign Affairs Kenneth Darroux expressed gratitude for the vaccine doses it received from India and other nations. ""We consider ourselves fortunate and express gratitude for being a recipient of donations of vaccines from the Governments of the Republic of India,"" China, UK, the US and through the COVAX facility. Nepal's Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Khadka said Kathmandu remains grateful to ""our immediate neighbours-India and China for their support in fighting the covid crisis."" He also thanked ""friendly countries"" like the United States, Britain, Japan and others for providing vaccines, critical medical equipment, and medicines in Nepal's fight against the pandemic. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said ""we are investing more than USD 620 million to procure millions of vaccine doses, and providing technical advice, training of health workers, and cold chain support to friends and neighbours. ""Now this includes a USD 100 million contribution to the Quad Vaccine Partnership with our good friends the United States, India and Japan.

""The state government should provide justice to every victim's family and ensure that such incidents do not happen again,"" Priyanka Gandhi Vadra added.

The police had earlier denied the charge and said the businessman suffered a head injury after he fell in an inebriated state. Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati has also attacked the BJP government in the state and said the incident exposed the government's tall claims on law and order. ""The barbaric act against three businessmen during a raid in a hotel in the CM's home district is very said and shameful,"" Mayawati tweeted in Hindi   ""It exposes tall claims of the BJP on law and order.

The Anandpur Sahib MP, whose Lok Sabha constituency includes nine of the legislative ones, also said that such disruption only makes Pakistan and its intelligence agency, the ISI, ""happy"". In the 1980s and 1990s, Punjab had suffered a violent insurgency largely backed by the neighbouring country.   ""Every Congressman will ensure that mandate of the people is respected.

Following the former cricketer's shock move, a few other newly appointed ministers, considered close to him, too, quit their position. ""I am extremely anguished and distressed at the way the things have panned out,"" Mr Tiwari said when asked if Mr Sidhu was ""stable"", something former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has repeatedly doubted. ""My only interest is in the implication of actions. It is up to the Chief Minister to run the government.

Scholz's SPD won 25.7 percent of the vote in Sunday's hard-fought general election, while Merkel's centre-right CDU-CSU bloc slumped to a record-low of 24.1 percent. ""The chancellor congratulated Olaf Scholz on Monday on his election success,"" the statement said. Merkel's would-be conservative successor Armin Laschet has yet to publicly do so. Despite leading the conservative alliance to its worst result in its seven-decade history, the unpopular Laschet has insisted on trying to form the next German coalition government with him as chancellor. But key conservative figures have increasingly distanced themselves from Laschet in recent days, raising doubts about his future. Bavarian premier Markus Soeder, leader of the CSU sister party to the CDU, publicly congratulated Scholz in a press conference on Tuesday, illustrating a growing rift with Laschet. ""Olaf Scholz clearly has the better chance of becoming chancellor at the moment,"" Soeder said, insisting the election result ""must be accepted, it is a basic rule of democracy"". Merkel herself is standing down after 16 years at the helm of Europe's top economy. But the veteran leader will stay on in a caretaker capacity until the new government is formed, expected to take weeks or even months.   With neither the SPD nor the CDU-CSU keen on teaming up again in a so-called grand coalition, the only way either can achieve a parliamentary majority is by partnering with the Greens and the pro-business FDP party.

YouTube said on Tuesday that RT's channels had breached its COVID-19 misinformation policy, a move Russia's Foreign Ministry described as ""unprecedented information aggression"". Russian state communications regulator Roskomnadzor said it had written to Google and demanded that the restrictions be lifted. It said Russia could seek to partially or fully restrict access to YouTube if it failed to comply. Google declined to comment on Wednesday. The Kremlin said it may have to force YouTube to comply with Russian law, saying there could be zero tolerance for breaches.

Moscow has increased pressure on foreign tech firms in the past year, fining social media companies for failing to delete content Russia deems illegal and punitively slowing down the speed of Twitter. That pressure led Google and Apple to remove an anti-government tactical voting app from their stores on the first day of a parliamentary election earlier this month, Kremlin critics said. Berlin denied an allegation by the Russian foreign ministry that YouTube's decision had been made with clear and tacit support from the German authorities and local media.

Nearly half of these patients died during treatment, said Dr Abahy Shukla of the Jan Aarogya Abhiyan, an umbrella group of activists working in the healthcare sector. ""We surveyed the cases of 2,579 patients, spoke to their relatives and audited the hospital bills. Ninety-five per cent of them were admitted to private hospitals,"" he told news agency Press Trust of India. ""We found that 75 per cent were overcharged. On average, the amount that was overcharged ranged between ₹ 10,000 to ₹ 1 lakh,"" said Dr Shukla. Most of these patients were hospitalized during the second wave of the pandemic. There were at least 220 women among these patients who shelled out between ₹ 1 lakh to 2 lakh more than the actual bill, while in 212 cases, the patients or their relatives paid more than ₹ two lakh in excess, Dr Shukla claimed. Though the Maharashtra government had announced that the rates of treatment of COVID-19 at private hospitals will be regulated, the official instructions were not heeded, he said. Many of these patients or their families faced a financial crisis, were forced to sell off jewelry, borrow from relatives or even take out loans from money lenders to settle the bills, he said. As many as 1,460 (56 per cent) of the patients or their relatives faced this situation, as per the survey. Seema Bhagwat, who lost her husband to mucormycosis, a fungal infection which some COVID-19 patients contracted, said he was in hospital for 38 days and they were presented a bill of ₹ 16 lakh. ""Still, I paid three EMIs of the bank. There was insurance cover for the bank loan, but because I approached them late, they are denying my claim. How can they expect me to submit my husband's death certificate the day after he died?"" she asked. ""I am not begging for help. But the hospital bill should be audited and if I have been overcharged, the difference should be refunded to me,"" she said. Shakuntala Bhalerao, convenor of the Abhiyan, said what is lacking is a law to regulate hospitals. A draft of the clinical establishment bill which seeks to create a regulatory mechanism is gathering dust, she added. ""We fought two cases in Pune recently and the hospitals returned ₹ 83,000 and ₹ 90,000. They even admitted that they had overcharged. But we can not fight each and every such case. There has to be some state mechanism to protect patients,"" Ms Bhalerao said.   Mukund Dikshit, a senior activist, recounted that a police complaint had to be filed in Nashik because a hospital refused to hand over a patient's body over unpaid bill. ""After intervention by the police and some activists, the body was handed over, but the hospital faced no action,"" he said.

But he now appears to have become the punchline himself. His latest tantrum could spell the end of his political journey which started after a not-so-glorious cricket career. Sidhu, like his batting, is unidimensional. He refuses to change either his style or his content. This did not bring him great glory in cricket, and is now repeating in politics. He thought he was destined for bigger things - in particular, being Chief Minister of Punjab - and as of this moment, that ambition is navigating disaster. And as always, it's likely that the 57-year-old will blame not himself but others. Sidhu's abrupt resignation as Congress chief in Punjab be a boon in disguise for the party. The world knows Sidhu as temperamental; Captain Amarinder Singh terms him ""not a stable man"". In the last few months, the Congress leadership has bent backwards to accommodate his wishes, making him not only the state party president but effectively sacking its tallest leader in the state, Captain Amarinder Singh. In keeping with Sidhu's wishes and demands, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, the choice of the Congress MLAs for Chief Minister was discarded, and on his advice, Charanjit Singh Channi was appointed to the top job. But when Sidhu tried to act as a ""Super Chief Minister"", the Congress decided to push back. True to his nature, Sidhu acted to his own detriment. Now he seems isolated, and his resignation may not create the big crater he expected. If Sidhu does not withdraw his resignation, a new state Congress chief is likely to be appointed to prove he has exhausted his political capital within the party. In my opinion, the Congress blundered in appointing him chief in the first place. Sidhu is charismatic, honest, a great orator who draws large crowds, but he is neither a team player nor an inspiring leader. He is too temperamental and ambitious. He left the BJP in 2017 because he felt he was not getting his due. He then floated his own outfit which was too small to fulfil his mammoth ambitions. Then he flirted with the Aam Admi Party (AAP). Arvind Kejriwal in a 5 AM meeting realised that Sidhu was too hot to handle and cleverly offered him a deal he had to refuse. Sidhu was told that AAP could field his wife, an MLA, in the elections, and Sidhu would campaign for the party. Sidhu had not bargained for this. He got the message. He then met Rahul Gandhi and joined the Congress Party. One can argue that Sidhu was used to topple Amarinder Singh, and then Sidhu trapped himself and resigned. Those who support the Gandhis can only wish that all this was done by design. Instead, they genuinely believed that it was time to let him take charge. Handing over the entire Punjab Congress to him was naive and immature. The Gandhis will make an equally big mistake if his resignation is not accepted. The Congress is not in a position to honour his ambition to make him Chief Minister and if it does so by removing Charanjit Singh Channi, then the Congress will antagonize the 32 per cent Dalit votes which have reportedly started galvanizing around Channi. It is better if the Congress begins anew with a clean slate in Punjab. Channi should continue as Chief Minister and a new party chief should be appointed and the two should work in tandem. The Congress in Punjab is facing anti-incumbency, though it is not massive. The removal of Captain Amarinder Singh was a move in the right direction to neutralise the anger of the people up to a certain extent. If Channi, with his Dalit support, is able to project himself as an honest crusader in Punjab politics, he could lead the party to re-election, but if Sidhu is retained, the Congress will have seated itself on a time bomb. Any more explosions courtesy Sidhu and the Congress will face total annihilation in the state. Let's accept the new reality in Punjab where politics since the death of Beant Singh have hinged on Prakash Singh Badal and Captain Amarinder Singh. This will be the first election where neither leader is centrally placed. If Badal is too old to run for another term, Amarinder Singh has been marginalized (as of now). And AAP remains hamstrung by not having a leader it can offer as Chief Minister. The Congress should be able to turn this landscape into a significant relief map by choosing a Dalit leader as Chief Minister, a revolutionary step in Punjab. The 32% Dalit vote could become the Congress torch-bearer provided the party shows it is willing to truly empower it. If it tries to weaken Channi or corrode his power as Chief Minister, if he is made to accommodate the whims and egos of senior leaders like Sidhu, if a perception is created that not Channi but someone else runs the government, the Congress could turn its ""master-stroke"" into ""disaster-stroke."" Punjab has recently shown it is more than open to experimenting. The unprecedented support extended to AAP in the 2014 parliamentary election is testimony to that fact. AAP most unexpectedly won four of the state's 13 Lok Sabha seats. In the 2017 assembly election, there was a massive surge for AAP till AAP squandered it all at the last minute. Every opinion poll had predicted a historic win for AAP, but its leadership proved to be incapable of cashing on that goodwill, instead it betrayed their feelings. AAP's naivety in understanding Punjabiyat, the nuances of the Sikh religion and its relationship with politics, proved to be its undoing, and after heading towards a socio-political revolution in Punjab, AAP had to contend with 20 seats and 23.8% votes. I am not sure if AAP has learnt any lesson; this time around, it is again offering neither any vision or leadership. The problem with AAP is that it thinks that people can be won over and over by doling out free water and free electricity. In Punjab, the Congress does not need to do anything spectacular. Channi's appointment is in itself a new beginning and now it only has to create a perception that a new Congress that is willing to approach politics in a new manner. But as usual, the Congress is in danger of destroying its own advantage. That is its biggest enemy.   (Ashutosh is Author and Editor, satyahindi.com.)

On the third day of her visit, she also met doctors and health workers and thanked them for their services during the Covid pandemic. Ms Gandhi Vadra said doctors and health workers served people round the clock during the Covid crisis. ""Several young doctors also remained connected with UP Congress helpline 'Hello Doctor',"" Lalan Kumar said, adding that she discussed several health issues of the people. The Congress leader also appealed to young doctors to give their suggestions on the issues relating to health services in the state, Mr Kumar said.

""The constitutional committee was set up nearly two years back and the process of drafting the Constitution needs to begin. The efforts of the last two years have made it clear that the external influence remains the major impeding factor hampering the progress on the political track, "" said Joint Secretary (UN Economic and Social) Srinivas Gotru at United Nations Security Council during the briefing on Syria. He further ""called on all external actors to desist from adversely influencing the parties concerned."" Mr Gotru said that the ceasefire agreement in Da'raa is a welcome development but highlighted the concerns with the overall situation in Syria. ""On the security front, the ceasefire agreement in Da'raa is a welcome development. However, we remain concerned with the overall situation in Syria, including in the North-East and the North-West. A nation-wide comprehensive ceasefire is paramount to the interests of the Syrian people."" he said. Highlighting the involvement of external actors in Syria which led to the growth of terrorism in the country, he said, ""We have pointed out the involvement of external actors in Syria and its impact on the growth of terrorism in both Syria and in the region. The designated terrorist groups such as ISIL and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham have continued to gain in strength in Syria.""   He further emphasised that long-term security and stability in West Asia can only be achieved by preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria. ""There can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict. We reaffirm our commitment to advancing a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned UN-facilitated political process in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254,"" he said."

Within moments, district fire officer Krishna Shetty left for the spot with a fire tender and a rescue vehicle. Deputy Director, fire and emergency services, Y A Kousar rushed to the spot too. At the building, more than 10 labourers were trying to gather their belongings and valuables before leaving. Realising that the structure can collapse anytime, Krishna Shetty asked them to leave everything behind and run for their lives. ""Gas cylinder, patre mattu batte olage bittu bega banni (leave gas cylinder, utensils and clothing and come out quickly),"" he said. ""Leave everything and come out quickly."" Azmatullah Shariff lives right opposite the Nanjappa building which collapsed. ""Most of the labourers were busy collecting their valuables and were taking time. If fire officers had not forcibly evacuated them, there could have been a big tragedy,"" he said. Thanks to the timely evacuation, no casualties or injuries were reported as the building collapsed. The fire officers also ensured that vehicles parked nearby were removed in time. The building, built in 1962, was vacant for a few years as no one was willing to stay in it due to its dilapidated condition. Then the metro rail project started nearby and contractors rented it to house labourers. About 40 labourers had been staying there and many of them were at work on Monday morning.   Besides saving many lives, fire officer Krishna Shetty also reportedly shot the horrifying video of the building collapse that has now gone viral. "

The Competition and Fair Trade Commission imposed a 2.1-billion-kwacha ($2.6 million) fine on mobile operator Airtel Malawi for engaging in ""unconscionable conduct"" in withholding airtime owed as part of a loyalty programme. Airtel Malawi is part of Bharti Airtel Limited that operates in 18 countries across Asia and Africa. The company describes itself as the largest mobile operator in Africa. The commission's acting executive director Apoche Itimu told a news briefing that the commission launched an investigation into Airtel Malawi on September 16, following several complaints from consumers. ""It was alleged that the Airtel Malawi stopped automatically crediting customer accounts with monthly bonuses"" of airtime, she said. Instead, consumers had to request their free airtime on the 14th of every month. Those who failed to do so lost their bonus. Itimu said the company made a financial gain of about 2.1 billion kwacha by ""engaging in unconscionable conduct in the trade of goods and services"". The commission fined Airtel Malawi the same amount.   Bharti Airtel's annual revenue of $14 billion is almost double the size Malawi's entire economy.

The Additional Director General of Odisha Police crime branch, Sanjeev Panda said the photograph of the woman operative has been obtained along with her video footage from video calls with the accused persons. ""We will establish contact with the Interpol to track down the mysterious lady handler who had been eliciting information from the five accused,"" he said. The probe agency has obtained proof that the ""mysterious woman"" had managed to hack the mobile phone of one of the accused for around eight months and kept tab on his activities. She had also managed to steal vital information about the ITR, Chandipur, Mr Panda said. The Odisha may seek further custody of the five accused persons, who are now in judicial custody, after verification of certain documents, he added. One of the accused has received ₹ 38,000 in two installments from Dubai. ""However, we have to establish whether the money came from the bank account of the woman or from someone else,"" he said. The woman had used a UK SIM card to contact the five employees of the Defense Research and Development Organisation who were arrested on September 14 and 16 for allegedly passing on vital defense related information to foreign agencies in lieu of money and other promises, including that of marriage. The woman posing as a resident of Balasore district spoke to the five accused, unknown to each other and stayed connected with them using seven Facebook accounts under different names, besides WhatsApp, Mr Panda had said earlier. She frequently video-called two of the accused and even gave marriage proposals to them. The woman had also invited one of them to ""her residence"" in Chandipur, he had said on the alleged honey-trap angle to the espionage case.   Meanwhile, the intelligence wing of the Indian Air Force has interrogated the five accused persons during their police remand. Two National Investigating Agency officers had visited the ITR and discussed the issue of security at the DRDO establishment from where major missiles are test fired.

Underscoring that his ""mission"" is to defeat the BJP, he said, ""I have lived as Congressman for last so many years. As a Congressman, I have the same principles and ideology as (the Trinamool Congress)... The Congress family is TMC, Sharad Pawar Congress, YSR Congress, Indira Congress... I will try to see that Congress family is consolidated"". ""I call on all -- YSR Congress etc -- come together as a united Congress family so we can face the BJP. I think the moment has come for everyone to join forces,"" he added. ""I have requested the leader who you lovingly call 'Didi' and protect the state, the habitat... The Congress family... In the congress family Didi has proved she can fight against the BJP. I hope she can fight under the united Congress banner,"" the former Goa Chief Minister said. Ms Banerjee, he said, is the ""only leader who has faced the BJP and their divisive agenda"" and won. ""They could not break Didi's indomitable spirit... We need such street fighters to fight the BJP,"" he added, after accepting the party flag from her nephew Abhishek Banerjee. After 40 years in the Congress, Mr Faleiro quit yesterday, telling party chief Sonia Gandhi in his resignation letter that he saw ""absolutely no hope or will to prevent the collapse of the party"". ""Till now, (no one is) being held accountable for the loss of 13 of our MLAs-- I see absolutely no hope or even the will to prevent the collapse of the party and change for the better,"" he wrote. ""The Congress in Goa is not the same party for which we had sacrificed and fought. It is functioning contrary to every ideal and principle of its founding fathers,"" Mr Faleiro added in his letter. Mr Faleiro, who walked out as the party is trying to cope with a huge crisis in Punjab ahead of an election year, refused today to criticize the Gandhi siblings, who critics say, have been unable to read the situation in Punjab.  The Gandhis had backed Navjot Sidhu after his year-long tug-of-war with Amarinder Singh that led to his exit from the Chief Minister's post earlier this month. But Mr Sidhu – who hoped to succeed Mr Singh -- quit the post of the party's state unit chief yesterday after a two-month stint, prolonging the political crisis. ""If you expect me to criticise Rahul Gandhi, I will not. I have a 40-year association with the party,"" Mr Faleiro told reporters in response to questions on the unrest within the Congress, escalated by a fresh letter from its group of in-house critics.   The 70-year-old's induction in Trinamool is expected to boost its chances in the tiny coastal state, which is drawing prominent national parties ahead of next year's assembly elections. Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party has added to the line-up. Mr Faleiro's inputs are also expected to be of great help to the Trinamool in Tripura, where the party is trying to expand its base and aggressively take on the BJP. Mr Faleiro was the Congress in-charge of Tripura in 2019."

Indonesia is worried that the pact, known as AUKUS, under which Australia will obtain nuclear submarine technology from the United States, would worsen an ""arms race and power projection"" in the region. Malaysia's concerns are similar, while neighbour the Philippines, a U.S. treaty ally, is behind it. ""This will reinforce our ongoing cooperation with key countries like Indonesia to make sure that we have a free and open Indo-Pacific that respects the rule of law,"" U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, Sung Kim, told a virtual forum. Kim said he is not worried about an arms race or nuclear proliferation, calling it a ""forward looking, positive"" initiative that would work in Indonesia's favour. AUKUS is largely seen as a response by Western allies to avert a Chinese hegemony in Southeast Asia and beyond, particularly the South China Sea, a conduit for a third of ship-borne trade, in which Beijing claims historical sovereignty. Indonesia earlier this month increased patrols in response to American and Chinese vessels. ""We are not asking any countries, including Indonesia, to make choices between U.S. and any other country,"" Kim said of AUKUS, adding the three allies have strong respect for the centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc. Kim also praised Indonesia's climate change efforts, particularly reducing greenhouse gas emission and deforestation.

N Alicia, the presiding officer of the Special Court for Hearing Cases Against MPs and MLAs, awarded the sentence after finding the two guilty of offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act. R Indira Kumari switched over to the DMK in 2006. The court also awarded three years' imprisonment to retired Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer P Shanmugam, who had then served as the Director of Rehabilitation of the Disabled and acquitted the ex-minister's former Personal Assistant (PA) Venkatakrishnan, after imposing a fine of ₹ 10,000 on him. R Indira Kumari was the Social Welfare minister during the period of 1991-96 in the J Jayalalithaa-led state cabinet. Immediately after the sentence was pronounced, R Indira Kumari, who was present in the court hall, complained of breathing problems and was admitted to the Government Royapettah Hospital in Chennai. The charges against another IAS officer Kirubakaran, the then Secretary of the Social Welfare department, were abated since he died during the trial.   According to the prosecution, the accused, in connivance with each other, had misappropriated government funds of ₹ 15.45 lakh allotted for floating two trusts - Mercy Mother India Charitable Trust for running a special school for hearing impaired children in the then North Arcot Ambedkar district and an institution for severely orthopedically handicapped children by Bharani Swathi Educational Trust in Chennai. The accused committed criminal misconduct, it was alleged. The case was registered in 1997, a year after the DMK came to power in 1996 and the charge sheet was filed in 2004."

Big Step Expected This Week,"Tata Group will likely get the government's nod to take control of money-losing Air India Ltd. considering the nation's largest conglomerate is capable of pouring large sums into the flag carrier and revamping it. That's according to former Air India director Jitender Bhargava, who said in a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday that Tata Group has the funds and wherewithal to revive it. ""Tatas have been very, very passionate about Air India,"" Bhargava said. ""J.R.D. Tata on record has said that this is his only creation, rest of the Tata companies came to him and he was only managing them. So there was a lot of passion, lot of emotional connection between Tatas and Air India, and that has made them bid for it."" Tata Sons Ltd., the group holding company that controls Jaguar Land Rover and owns a majority stake in AirAsia India, submitted a bid for Air India earlier this month. The other bidder is SpiceJet Ltd. owner Ajay Singh in his personal capacity. A recommendation on which party should be the victor is expected this week, possibly as soon as Wednesday. Air India, originally called Tata Airlines, was established in 1932 by the legendary industrialist and philanthropist J.R.D. Tata, who was also the country's first licensed pilot. It was nationalized around the time of independence in 1947. The government shouldn't hope for a large sum of money and must take a ""pragmatic view"" in selling Air India because keeping the ailing flag carrier would mean straining state finances year after year, Mr Bhargava said. ""When the government acquired Air India, they gave Tatas a pittance. There's no rationale for the government of India to start looking for huge sums of money as compensation,"" he said. Mr Bhargava also predicted that the sale will inevitably meet with political backlash. There will be allegations that the government is ""selling family silver, they're selling it cheap,"" but the best course would be to return the airline to Tata, he said.   Any new owner will have to upgrade the interiors of Air India's fleet and shake up a government-minded culture, Mr Bhargava added. ""If you look at the last 18 years, they've put at the helm of Air India bureaucrats with virtually no knowledge of the aviation industry,"" he said. ""It was just a matter of keeping the airline going rather than ensuring that Air India is injected with new talent and the network is expanded. We have often said stagnancy is the first sign of decay."""

As suggested by the experts, it was decided to consider opening middle school classes 6-8, after the festive season,"" Mr Baijal, who chaired the meeting, said in a tweet. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting was attended by Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain and Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot, Niti Ayog member VK Paul, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria,, ICMR DG Balram Bhargava and other senior officials of departments concerned. ""Even as the experts expressed satisfaction at the prevailing situation and efforts being undertaken by departments and agencies concerned, it was strongly reiterated that guards in terms of Covid-appropriate behaviour and its enforcement cannot be let down, especially in light of the forthcoming festive season,"" a source said. ""As advised by the experts, it was decided to open the remaining classes in schools after the festive season,"" he added. Several private schools have been demanding that the schools reopen now for junior classes. A group of parents and school teachers had last week staged a protest outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal''s residence here, and demanded reopening of schools for students of primary section and classes 6-8. ""Disappointing decision once again by the government. It has been a month since the schools reopened for senior classes and all has been well thankfully so what is the harm in calling other classes as well. The attendance has been less in private schools not because of Covid concerns but because not all schools are providing transport,"" said RC Jain, president, Delhi Schools Association. However, Delhi Parents Association's president Aparajita Gautam hailed the government's decision. ""There have already been predictions about a possible third wave in October-November. Also the festival rush can contribute to a rise in cases so it''s wise to take an informed decision after the festivals,"" Gautam said. Following a marked improvement in the COVID-19 situation in the national capital, the Delhi government had last month announced that schools for classes 9 to 12, colleges and coaching institutions would reopen from September 1. The Delhi government had clarified that no student would be forced to attend physical classes and the consent of parents would be mandatory. Allowing only 50 per cent students per classroom, mandatory thermal screening, staggered lunch breaks, alternate seating arrangement and avoiding routine guest visits were among the guidelines announced by the DDMA for reopening of schools and colleges from September 1. The DDMA had said students, teachers and non-teaching staff living in Covid containment zones would not be allowed to come to schools and colleges. Schools in the national capital were ordered shut last year in March ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.   While several states started partial reopening of schools in October last year, the Delhi government allowed physical classes only for classes 9-12 in January this year, which were again suspended following the exponential rise in COVID-19 cases during the aggressive second wave.

A third charge was taken into consideration against Damandeep Singh, who had managed to evade detection this way at least twice before his own tenancy was terminated, The Straits Times reported. In 2017, Damandeep Singh met Housing and Development Board (HDB) enforcement officer Kalayarasan Karuppaya, 55, while the officer was conducting an inspection on a unit that Damandeep Singh was living in. Later, they became friends and would occasionally contact each other over the phone. Damandeep Singh later moved to another unit, which he illegally sublet to others. Some 12 or 13 people ended up living in the estate, against the set rule for the maximum number of occupants in a residential unit, and about 200 Singaporean dollars were collected monthly from each of the illegal subtenants. The Housing and Development Board, as managers of the housing estate, received complaints from members of the public about suspected overcrowding and noise at the unit. It also received similar information from the police which had raided the unit on complaints from neighbours. But Damandeep Singh received an alert from his friend Karuppaya about surprise checks of the unit planned by HDB for May 8, 2019, and September 10, 2019. Damandeep Singh told the illegal subtenants to quickly move out prior to the inspections, which then found no observable signs of overcrowding or illegal subletting, the report said.   But after HDB enforcement officers informed the unit's owner about the information from the police, Damandeep Singh's tenancy was terminated and the unit was vacated the same month, in September 2019. The offences came to light after the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau received information in January last year about Karuppaya's tip-offs to Damandeep Singh. The HDB officer was also jailed for 25 days last month for offences under the Official Secrets Act. For each Official Secrets Act charge of wrongful communication of information, Damandeep Singh could have been jailed for up to two years and fined 2,000 Singaporean dollars."

""Locked up in my house today yet again for attempting to visit the village in Tral allegedly ransacked by army.

She tweeted that being placed under ""house arrest"" exposed ""fake claims of normalcy"", and posted a similar picture - her locked front gate and an armoured truck parked nearby. ""Government of India expresses concern for the rights of Afghan people but wilfully denies the same to Kashmiris. I've been placed under house arrest today because according to the administration the situation is far from normal in Kashmir. This exposes their fake claims of normalcy,"" she said.

Health authorities reported 45 new cases, all in the biggest city, Auckland, taking the total number of cases in the current outbreak to 1,230. It's much higher than the eight reported on Tuesday, and the highest number of daily cases since Sept 2. COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins urged New Zealanders to stay calm, saying: ""We do expect from time to time there will be blips."" Hipkins said at least 33 of the new cases are known household or close contacts of existing cases and most have been isolating at home or in quarantine facilities while infectious. ""I would encourage people not to read too much into it. We are still aiming to run this into the ground,"" Hipkins said at a news conference. The continuing emergence of daily cases has raised questions whether New Zealand can eliminate the virus. A top health official said last week that the country may never be back to zero cases again. New Zealand eliminated COVID-19 last year and remained largely virus-free until an outbreak of the Delta variant in August led to a nationwide lockdown. Auckland has been in lockdown for over a month. A delayed a vaccine rollout, however, means more people are at risk in the latest outbreak. Ardern is now facing pressure from expatriate Kiwis and their families back home to drop her ""zero tolerance"" strategy and reopen borders. The opposition National Party said on Wednesday that it would end lockdowns and reopen borders before Christmas. ""Delta is here, it may not be possible to eliminate it, and it would almost inevitably arrive into the community again. Whatever happens, we need to reopen to the world and National's plan outlines how we can do that,"" National Party leader Judith Collins said.   Ardern has announced a phased reopening plan for early next year. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

In a special bulletin issued in the afternoon, the IMD said the remnants of cyclonic storm 'Gulab' lay as a well-marked low pressure area over south Gujarat region and the adjoining Gulf of Khambhat at 8:30 am on Wednesday. ""It is very likely to move west-northwestwards, emerge into the northeast Arabian Sea and intensify into a depression by Thursday. It is then very likely to move further west-northwestwards and intensify into a cyclonic storm during the subsequent 24 hours. Thereafter, it is likely to continue to move west-northwestwards towards Pakistan-Makran coast, moving away from the Indian coast,"" it said. The IMD warned fishermen not to venture into the north Arabian Sea off Gujarat coast from Wednesday to Saturday and suggested total suspension of fishing activities there during the period. It also asked fishermen who were out in the sea to return to the coast and move to safer places by Wednesday evening. Gujarat has so far received 90 per cent of its average annual rainfall, the state's Special Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC) said. In the 24-hour period ending at 6 am on Wednesday, Surat's Umarpada taluka received 218 mm rainfall and Palsana got 192 mm rain. Several parts of Dangs, Valsad, Narmada, Ahmedabad, Anand, Tapi and other districts also received very heavy showers on Tuesday, the SEOC said. In six hours since 6 am Wednesday, heavy rainfall was recorded in parts of Bharuch and Navsari districts in south Gujarat, and Amreli and Bhavnagar in Saurashtra, as per the SEOC data.   Bharuch taluka of the district received 95 mm rainfall, Rajula in Amreli recorded 78 mm, and Jafrabad in Amreli district 69 mm rainfall.

1321,Wed Sep 29 09:43:06 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: British Army To Start Driving Tankers As Queues For Fuel Continue https://t.co/J8XbWHsqMH https://t.co/Do34LwY8G5,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/britain-fuel-crisis-british-army-to-start-driving-tankers-as-queues-for-fuel-continue-2557722,British Army To Start Driving Tankers As Queues For Fuel Continue,"British soldiers will start driving tankers to replenish empty pumps, as drivers queued again for fuel after days of shortages, despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying the situation was improving. Britain has been gripped by a rush of panic-buying for almost a week that has left pumps dry across major cities, after oil companies warned they did not have enough tanker drivers to move petrol and diesel from refineries to filling stations. Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said 150 soldiers had been mobilised, and would be driving tankers within a few days. ""The last few days have been difficult, we've seen large queues. But I think the situation is stabilising, we're getting petrol into the forecourts. I think we're going to see our way through this,"" Kwarteng said. Johnson has sought to quell concerns, saying supplies were returning to normal while also urging people not to panic buy. A shortage of around 100,000 drivers has sown chaos through supply chains and raised the spectre of empty shelves and price increases at Christmas. Asked if he could guarantee that there would not be problems in the run-up to the busy retail period, Kwarteng said: ""I'm not guaranteeing anything. All I'm saying is that, I think the situation is stabilising."" By the early morning rush hour there were already long queues of cars in and around London and on the busy M25 orbital motorway circling the capital. Signs were up at some sites announcing no fuel was available. The gridlock has sparked calls for doctors, nurses and other essential workers to be given priority access to fuel, a move Johnson has resisted. Industry groups said the worst of the shortages seemed to be in London, the southeast and other English cities. Fights have broken out as drivers jostled. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents independent retailers who account for about two-thirds of all the 8,380 UK filling stations, said on Tuesday 37% its members' stations were out of fuel. The shortages have added to an air of chaos in the world's fifth-largest economy, leaving gaps on supermarket shelves. A spike in European wholesale natural gas prices has also tipped energy companies into bankruptcy. Britain left the EU single market at the start of this year, preventing hauliers from recruiting drivers in the bloc. To tackle the shortage, the government has said it will issue temporary visas to 5,000 foreign drivers, a measure it had previously ruled out. ""What we want to do is make sure that we have all the preparations necessary to get through until Christmas and beyond, not just in supplying the petrol stations but all parts of our supply chain,"" Johnson said.   Hauliers, petrol stations and retailers say there are no quick fixes as the shortfall of drivers is so acute, and transporting fuel demands training and licensing. European drivers may also be reluctant to take up the visa offer, which only lasts until Dec. 24. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

While Ghosn is at large in Lebanon after fleeing Japan in an audio equipment box, Kelly is the only person to stand trial over claims Nissan tried to hide planned payments to the auto tycoon. In a Tokyo court, prosecutors also demanded that Nissan, standing trial as a firm alongside Kelly, be fined 200 million yen ($1.8 million). The defence will deliver their final arguments on October 27 and the verdict could follow several months later. Prosecutors alleged that the 65-year-old American lawyer and former top Nissan executive played a key role in what they described as a conspiracy to under-report Ghosn's compensation between 2010 and 2018. Falsifying annual securities reports can carry a sentence of up to 10 years under Japanese law. Kelly has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and is living in Tokyo, out on bail and forbidden from leaving Japan while fighting the case. The Nissan scandal erupted in November 2018 when Ghosn and Kelly were arrested in Tokyo, grabbing headlines and sending shockwaves around the corporate world. Ghosn was slapped with a series of financial misconduct charges, including allegations he was to receive payment after retirement that should have been declared but was not. The charges against Kelly involve payments of around 9.2 billion yen ($83 million at current rates) that prosecutors say was promised to his former boss upon retirement. Nissan has pleaded guilty to the charge against it over the alleged payments. But both Kelly and Ghosn say no final agreement was made on any post-retirement pay, and therefore no disclosure was legally required. - Vast fallout - Ghosn, a French, Lebanese and Brazilian national, jumped bail and fled to Lebanon in December 2019, where he remains a fugitive. He says he fled for fear he would not receive a fair trial, and claims the charges against him were cooked up by Nissan executives opposed to his plans to more closely integrate the firm with French partner Renault. The fallout from Ghosn's arrest has been vast, with Nissan's CEO forced out after his own financial irregularities were uncovered in a subsequent probe. And Ghosn's audacious escape has also prompted legal fallout around the globe. In July, a Japanese court sentenced an American father-son duo who helped Ghosn flee the country to two years in prison after the pair was extradited from the United States. Former US special forces operative Michael Taylor and his son Peter were convicted of helping smuggle a disguised Ghosn onto a private jet in a box. Two pilots and another employee of a small private airline in Turkey, where Ghosn switched planes before heading to Lebanon, have also been sentenced to four years and two months for their role in the escape. Ghosn was questioned by French investigators in Lebanon in May over a series of alleged financial improprieties. But he was only heard as a witness, and would need to be in France to be formally indicted. The Ghosn saga has continued to stalk Nissan as it battles weak demand during the pandemic and a global shortage of microchips.   But earlier this year, the Japanese carmaker told shareholders it projected a return to the black in the current financial year as the industry recovers.

Baby Dianna was born on 28 July, 2021 in Mauritius with a cyanosis (bluish or grey-ish colour of the skin, nails, lips or around the eyes) and was diagnosed with valvular pulmonary atresia, a defect of the heart found at birth where the valve that controls blood flow from the heart to the lungs doesn't open at all. She was surviving on the patent ductus arteriosus & was being taken care of in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). With the help of the government and a local doctor, she was brought to Mumbai on 12 August, 2021. Dianna was immediately stabilized and, in less than 24 hours, was taken to a catheterization lab for a cardiac procedure. Before starting the procedure, Baby Dianna developed a severe cardiac arrest, which needed immediate shock treatment (4 to 6 shocks were delivered), along with multiple emergency cardiac medicines. In the last 16 months, Apollo Hospitals, Navi Mumbai has treated over 60 children from Mauritius. The lead doctor of this case, Dr Bhushan Chavan, Consultant, Interventional Paediatric Cardiology at Apollo Hospitals Navi Mumbai, explains, ""As her condition deteriorated, she was referred for further clinical management by a flight to Apollo Hospitals, Navi Mumbai, by the Mauritius government. The condition of Baby Dianna was grim, with no response to these treatments, so a temporary pacemaker was inserted as a last resort and it kept the heart beating, at the rate of 150/min. CPR was still continued and the procedure was abandoned."" Post the shock treatment, in the next couple of minutes, Dianna's heart regained its own rhythm and as a result, the pacemaker was removed. Baby Dianna was shifted to NICU for stabilization. In the next 10 days, the baby overcame all the neonatal problems (including acute kidney failure) and successfully extubated. She was also coming back to normal neurological functioning, as per a paediatric neurologist, which was another miracle, given the long duration of CPR and cardiac arrest she experienced. Once Dianna stabilised, Dr Chavan went ahead with the interventional procedure, where perforation and a balloon pulmonary valvotomy (which is the widening of a narrowed pulmonary valve by using a balloon catheter inside the valve) was performed to open up the defective pulmonary valve that had caused the cardiac arrest in the first place. Santosh Marathe, COO & Unit Head, Apollo Hospitals, Navi Mumbai, said, ""Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common congenital disorder in newborns and affects around 8 in every 1000 babies. The successful treatment of Baby Dianna is a proud moment for our institution. Our team of world class experts have made sure Apollo Hospitals Navi Mumbai is recognised as one of the most advanced centres in Western India for paediatric cardiac care. The rising number of heart diseases in India has become a major concern now, and with the growing pandemic, there is even bigger threat to people who are at risk of cardiovascular diseases.""   He further added, ""Till date Apollo Hospitals Navi Mumbai have treated over 350 paediatric children and are equipped with state of the art NICU and PICU facilities, backed by good intensive care, paediatric cardiologists and paediatric heart surgery team."" The case highlights how complex a critical congenital heart problem can be if not treated on time. The excellence and the dedication of the team of doctors at Apollo Hospitals is a perfect example to this, which gave a new lease of life for the baby and the entire family."

Here's Why,"China's vast Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is in danger of losing momentum as opposition in targeted countries rises and debts mount, paving the way for rival schemes to squeeze Beijing out, a new study showed on Wednesday. President Xi Jinping launched BRI in 2013 to use China's strengths in financing and infrastructure construction to ""build a broad community of shared interests"" throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America. But Xi's ""project of the century"" is now facing major challenges and significant backlashes abroad, according to a study by AidData, a research lab at the College of William and Mary in the United States. ""A growing number of policy makers in low- and middle-income countries are mothballing high profile BRI projects because of overpricing, corruption and debt sustainability concerns,"" said Brad Parks, one of the study's authors. AidData said $11.58 billion in projects in Malaysia have been cancelled over 2013-2021, with nearly $1.5 billion cancelled in Kazakhstan and more than a $1 billion in Bolivia. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. He Lingxiao, spokesperson for the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which is closely linked to the BRI, said ""we believe the overarching principles of BRI are sound"". ""How these principles will be translated into operational reality is where we advocate for high international standards,"" He said. The AidData study looked at 13,427 Chinese-backed projects in 165 countries over 18 years, worth $843 billion in total, and noted that Beijing's annual international development finance commitments are now double those of the United States. But major changes in public sentiment made it difficult for participating countries to maintain close relations with Beijing, Parks said. The study said an increasing number of China-backed projects have been suspended or cancelled since BRI's 2013 launch, with evidence of ""buyer's remorse"" in countries as far afield as Kazakhstan, Costa Rica and Cameroon. Credit risks have also increased, with the exposure to Chinese debt now exceeding 10% of GDP in many low- and middle-income countries. The survey found that 35% of Belt and Road projects were struggling with corruption, labour violations, environmental pollution and public protests. In June this year, the United States announced a rival G7 initiative known as Build Back Better World (B3W) to provide financial support for developing nations to build infrastructure. ""B3W is going to increase choice in the infrastructure financing market, which could lead to some high-profile BRI defections,"" Parks said. AidData's study received funding from a diverse group of private and public organizations, including the Ford Foundation and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).   It said its research is independent and transparent and not guided or determined by its funders. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

The long-range FH-97 drone concept unveiled on Wednesday can carry different types of weapons, and has swarm and electronic warfare capabilities, said Wu Wei, a representative of China Aerospace Science Technology Corp's (CASTC) Feihong product line. He did not provide specifics in his presentation at Airshow China in Zhuhai. The United States, Britain, Australia, India and Russia are among the countries developing ""loyal wingman"" drones, which are cheaper and more expendable than crewed fighters. CASTC did not provide technical details of the FH-97 concept, nor say whether it was planned for export, though many foreign observers watched the presentation. The FH-97's appearance is nearly identical to the Kratos XQ-58A, which made its first flight in 2019. The XQ-58A has a maximum speed of Mach 0.85 and a range of about 2,200 nautical miles. Zhang Zhongyang, vice president of CASTC said the plan was to turn Feihong into an ""international top-notch brandnd become a major player at the centre stage of the world arena."" China has exported military drones to countries including the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and Serbia. ""The chief customer is certainly the PLA, but in recent years the Chinese are also aggressively marketing these systems for exports,"" said Collin Koh, a defence research fellow with Singapore's Rajaratnam School of International Studies. China also used the country's biggest air show to display the weapons capability of one of its most advanced stealth attack drone projects, the GJ-11. The Global Times reported that the GJ-11 on display at the show had its two weapons bays open for the first time. Inside each were four unidentified munitions that appeared to be precision air-to-ground glide bombs. Bradley Perrett, a specialist on Asian aerospace and defence, said the GJ-11 was designed to slip undetected through radar coverage and attack heavily defended targets. ""In doing that, it would take the place of a much larger and more expensive fighter with a pilot,"" he said. ""Development won't be easy, but when it's complete the type will present a new threat to Taiwan and potentially Japan.""   Chinese companies have 27 drone exhibits at the Zhuhai show.

""This will rattle the generals as they are quite obsessed with the kyat rate as a broader barometer of the economy, and therefore a reflection on them,"" Richard Horsey, a Myanmar expert at the International Crisis Group, said. In August, the Central Bank of Myanmar tried tethering the kyat 0.8% on either side of its reference rate against the dollar, but gave up on Sept 10 as pressure on the exchange rate mounted. The shortage of dollars has become so bad that some money changers have pulled down their shutters. ""Due to the currency price instability at the moment...all Northern Breeze Exchange Service branches are temporarily closed,"" the money changer said on Facebook. Those still operating were quoting a rate of 2,700 kyat per dollar on Tuesday, compared to 1,695 on September 1 and 1,395 back on February 1, when the military overthrew a democratically elected government led by Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. In a report published on Monday, the World Bank predicted the economy would slump by 18% this year, partly due to the pandemic, saying that Myanmar would see the biggest contraction in employment in the region, and that the number of poor people in the country would rise. The increasing economic pressures come amid signs of an upsurge in bloodshed, as armed militias have become bolder in clashes with the army after months of protests and strikes by opponents of the junta. ""The worse the political situation is, the worse the currency rate will be,"" said a senior executive at a Myanmar bank, who declined to be named. Myanmar is also struggling to deal with a second wave of coronavirus cases that started in June with the response by authorities crippled after many health workers joined protests. Reported cases have comes off their highs, though the true extent of the outbreak remains unclear. Stay-at-home orders in some townships have been withdrawn, but are still in effect in some areas. In the immediate months after the February 1 coup, many people queued up to withdraw savings from banks and some bought gold, but a jewellery merchant in Yangon said many desperate people were now trying to sell their gold back. The central bank gave no reason to why it abandoned its managed float strategy earlier this month, but analysts believe its foreign currency reserves must be seriously depleted. Central bank officials did not answer calls seeking comment on how much foreign currency was left, but World Bank data shows it had just $7.67 billion in reserves at the end of 2020. After coming off its managed float, the central bank still spent $65 million, buying kyat at a rate of 1,750 to 1,755 per dollar between Sept 13-27. The bank executive said the central bank's efforts had limited impact in a currency market shorn of confidence. The economic crisis has driven up the price of staples, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said this week that around three million people now require humanitarian assistance in Myanmar, up from one million before the coup. A 48-kilogram bag of rice costs 48,000 kyat, up nearly 40% since the coup, while gasoline prices have nearly doubled to 1,445 kyat per litre. The crisis is also hurting businesses, particularly those needing to import raw materials. A plastic bag manufacturer in Yangon said he had been forced to increase prices and sales had dropped about 30%. Per capita gross domestic product was just $1,400 last year, and Zaw, a resident in Yangon who asked to use only part of his name, was under no illusion about where Myanmar was heading.   ""People will become poorer,"" he stated. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"
1334,Wed Sep 29 08:46:42 +0000 2021,RT @ndtvfeed: Britney Spears' Lawyers Push For End To Father's Control Ahead Of Hearing https://t.co/HNYWKANL6D https://t.co/cOumz0ZMqd,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/britney-spears-lawyers-push-for-end-to-fathers-control-ahead-of-hearing-2557645,Britney Spears' Lawyers Push For End To Father's Control Ahead Of Hearing,"After weeks of twists and turns -- and two major new documentaries -- Britney Spears' highly public bid to end her father's guardianship could reach its conclusion at a court hearing Wednesday. Britney's father has controlled her life for the past 13 years, under a controversial legal arrangement that the US pop singer has slammed as ""abusive"" and that her lawyers have demanded be scrapped. Jamie Spears ""must be suspended on September 29th; followed by the prompt termination of the conservatorship,"" her lawyer Mathew Rosengart wrote in a filing this week. ""Every day that goes by with him as conservator -- every day and every hour -- is one in which he causes his daughter anguish and pain,"" the petition says. Those claims were seemingly bolstered by a New York Times documentary released Friday that alleged Jamie Spears had surveillance devices secretly installed in Britney's bedroom to record her conversations. ""It really reminded me of somebody that was in prison,"" a former security firm employee told the ""Controlling Britney Spears"" filmmakers. Britney's lawyers this week said the Times' allegations about Jamie Spears showed ""horrifying and unconscionable invasions of his adult daughter's privacy."" Jamie Spears denies any illegal surveillance took place. Yet another new documentary -- Netflix's ""Britney vs Spears,"" released on Tuesday -- claims Britney twice tried to hire her own lawyer in the early years of the conservatorship, but was denied. In July, Britney was finally successful in appointing her own lawyer -- Rosengart -- and last month Jamie Spears himself filed a petition for Britney's conservatorship to be ended. But while he acknowledged his daughter ""believes that she can handle her own life,"" he remains in place. 'Never fit to serve' In the petition this week, Britney's lawyers accuse Jamie Spears of seeking to delay the end of the guardianship for his own financial benefit. His efforts are ""a subterfuge, designed to avoid the stigma of being suspended and its consequences, including the likelihood of disgorgement and rejection of outstanding legal fees,"" the petition alleges. ""Disgorgement"" is a legal term meaning the repayment of ill-gotten gains. Britney's representatives and fans have long accused her father of profiting from the guardianship, which was set up after a highly public 2007 breakdown when the shaven-headed star attacked a paparazzo's car at a gas station. Meanwhile, Jamie Spears has objected to Britney's choice of a new temporary conservator to replace him, saying that certified public accountant John Zabel lacks the necessary experience, US media reported Monday. In turn, Britney's lawyers say her father was ""never fit to serve,"" citing in their petition allegations of Jamie Spears' ""reported alcoholism"" and ""trauma he caused his daughter since her childhood.""   Many of those barbs are likely to resurface on Wednesday afternoon, when a total of 15 petitions are listed to be heard by Judge Brenda Penny at a downtown Los Angeles courthouse.

The move makes CNN, which is owned by AT&T Inc, the first major news organisation to pull its Facebook presence in Australia since the country's High Court ruled this month that publishers were legally responsible for comments posted below stories - even if the stories themselves were not defamatory. CNN does not feature prominently in Australian media consumption, but the decision could have reverberations across the industry if other outlets follow suit. A host of global mastheads have boosted their Australian operations in recent years after identifying the country as a growth market. ""This is the first domino to fall,"" said Michael Bradley, managing partner of Marque Lawyers, which works on defamation cases. ""Others will follow for sure...mainly media entities who feel they can happily live without the Australian Facebook audience."" CNN said that Facebook declined a request to help it and other publishers disable public comments in the country following the ruling, which was made during the course of an ongoing defamation lawsuit. CNN's main Facebook page showed an error message when accessed from Australia on Wednesday. ""We are disappointed that Facebook, once again, has failed to ensure its platform is a place for credible journalism and productive dialogue around current events among its users,"" a CNN spokeswoman said in a statement. A Facebook spokesperson said recent court decisions had shown the need for reform in Australian defamation law and the company looked forward to ""greater clarity and certainty in this area"". ""While it's not our place to provide legal guidance to CNN, we have provided them with the latest information on tools we make available to help publishers manage comments,"" the spokesperson said. Facebook says it has several features available for publishers and other users to restrict who can comment on posts. Facebook and CNN did not give details of the discussions that led to CNN's decision. Social media is a central channel for distributing content in Australia, with about two-thirds of the country's 25 million population on Facebook, according to industry figures. About a third of the country's population used Facebook to source news in 2021, a University of Canberra report said. But that has coincided with an explosion in defamation lawsuits, prompting reviews by several state and federal governments to determine if existing laws are appropriate for the internet age. ""The fact that a foreign outlet like CNN are pulling out shows the degree of concern that Australia's laws have not kept up with the pace of technological change,"" said Matt Collins, a prominent defamation lawyer. CNN would have no equivalent exposure in the United States and relatively little exposure in Britain or other English-speaking countries like New Zealand, he added.   ""Australia is among Western democracies an outlier, in relation to the circumstances in which media organisations and any user of social media can be liable for content they didn't they themselves write or approve of.""

The preliminary examination consists of two papers of objective type (multiple choice) questions and carries a maximum of 400 marks. This stage is meant to serve as a screening test only, and the marks obtained in it by the candidates who are declared qualified for admission to the main examination are not counted for determining their final order of merit. The merit is determined out of the total of 2,025 marks - written or main exam is of 1,750 marks and the interview is of 275. Shubham Kumar got a total of 1,054 marks - 878 in the written and 176 in the personality test (or interview), according to UPSC data. Jagrati Awasthi scored 1,052 - 859 in written and 193 in interview, it showed.

""Nothing has been done intentionally. If anybody has objection on any appointment, then I am not rigid on that... I don't have ego tussles... I told him party is supreme, let's talk,"" Mr Channi told reporters today, recounting their telephonic conversation. Mr Sidhu resigned in a fit of pique without any consultation with the party after Mr Channi named his cabinet where he, apparently, was not consulted. He is upset about several appointments, where the candidates were temporarily linked to corruption cases or happen to be a political rival. Earlier today, Mr Sidhu released a video message, saying he could not compromise on ethics or ""moral authority"". ""I will make any sacrifice to stand by principles... I broke the system where tainted ministers and officers were accommodated. Now tainted ministers and officers can't be appointed again. I oppose such appointments,"" Mr Sidhu said in what apparently was a reference to Rana Gurjit Singh, who quit the Amarinder Singh cabinet in 2018 after being linked to a sand mining scam. He was later cleared by an inquiry panel. He is also upset about the key home ministry being assigned to political rival and Deputy Chief Minister SS Randhawa. He also has reservations about the appointment of senior IPS officer Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, who has been given additional charge as Punjab Police chief. Mr Sahota was the head of a Special Investigation Team to probe the incidents linked to the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib in 2015. The biggest sore point has been the appointment of APS Deol as Advocate General. Mr Deol was counsel for a former police chief accused in a case related to the 2015 sacrilege cases and police firing on protesters.   The Amarinder Singh government's alleged non-action in the sacrilege cases has been one of the biggest grouses of the Congress rebels, including Mr Sidhu. The rebellion, simmering for over a year, led to the resignation of Mr  Singh earlier this month. But Mr Sidhu, who hoped to step into his shoes, remained disappointed as the party high command chose Mr Channi for the job."

Some industry officials said low demand and the extremely cold storage temperatures required have spurred at least three big hospitals to cancel orders for Sputnik V, which is sold only on the private market in the world's biggest producer of vaccines. ""With storage and everything, we have cancelled our order for 2,500 doses,"" said Jitendra Oswal, a senior medical official at Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical College and Hospital in the western city of Pune.  ""Demand is also not great. There is a class of people, barely 1%, that wanted to go for Sputnik. For the rest, anything would do."" From May until last week, private hospitals doled out just about 6% of all vaccines administered in India, although the government had freed them to buy up to a quarter of domestic output, Health Ministry data shows. India is a major production centre of Sputnik V, with planned capacity of about 850 million shots a year, and low domestic uptake could mean higher exports instead, a step backers are already pushing for. The health ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since a June launch event by Indian distributor Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd, only 943,000 doses of Sputnik V have been administered by hospitals, a fraction of the national total of more than 876 million. Dr Reddy's declined to comment. The mainstay of India's inoculation drive is the AstraZeneca vaccine, which can be stored in regular refrigerators, unlike Sputnik V, which needs temperatures of -18 degrees Celsius (-0.4 degrees Farhenheit), impossible to guarantee in most of India. The vaccine is also as much as 47% more expensive than AstraZeneca on the private market. Avis Hospitals, which runs eight vaccination centres in the southern city of Hyderabad, has also cancelled an order for 10,000 Sputnik V doses, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter who sought anonymity in discussing business matters. Avis did not respond to an email seeking comment. Another Pune hospital, which declined to be identified in order to keep intact its ties to Dr Reddy's, which is also a major drug supplier, said it had also cancelled its Sputnik V orders. Sputnik V is just one of the vaccines suffering from a sharp fall in private sales. Pune's Bharati Hospital will end its COVID-19 vaccination programme when it runs out of AstraZeneca doses, as daily inoculations have fallen about 90% to 100, since private sales picked up in May and June, Oswal said. Just 9,000 doses remain of stocks of 62,000 it ordered. Avis's COVID-19 vaccine sales have shrunk 40% with existing stocks expected to last until December, instead of October, said the source. India's monthly production of vaccine, mainly of the AstraZeneca shot known domestically as Covishield, has quadrupled to 300 million doses from April, when a dramatic surge in infections and deaths prompted a halt in exports. Overseas sales are to resume in October.   Covishield accounts for 88% of India's inoculations, followed by Bharat Biotech's domestically developed Covaxin, and both have been administered free, mainly at government centres, since mid-January.

A letter from the hardline group was sent to the DGCA earlier this month, and is under review by the Civil Aviation Ministry. Addressed to DGCA chief Arun Kumar, the letter says the Kabul airport - ""left damaged and dysfunctional by American troops before their withdrawal"" - had become operational with help from Qatar, and that a NOTAM (notice to airmen) in this regard had been issued on September 6. ""The intention of this letter is to keep smooth passenger movement between the two countries based on signed MoU and our National Carriers (Ariana Afghan Airline & Kam Air) aimed to commence scheduled flights. Therefore, Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority requests you to facilitate commercial flights,"" acting Aviation Minister Alhaj Hameedullah Akhunzada wrote. India had stopped all commercial flight operations to Kabul after August 15, when the Taliban swept into the Afghan capital and took effective control of the war-torn country. So far only a limited number of aid and passenger flights have been operating out of Kabul. On September 13 an international commercial flight - a Pakistan International Airlines plane - became the first passenger jet to fly in and out of Kabul in over a month. Since then, a few others have begun flying but with ticket prices remain high, Reuters said. Last week the Taliban appealed to other airlines as well, promising its co-operation and saying that all problems - including ""damages"" caused by withdrawing Western forces - had been resolved. Taliban spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi told news agency Reuters suspension of international flights had left Afghans stranded abroad and prevented people from travelling for work or study. ""As problems at Kabul International Airport have been resolved and the airport is fully operational for domestic and international flights, the IEA assures all airlines of its full cooperation,"" he said. Repairs have been carried out with the assistance of technical teams from Qatar and Turkey, he said. The IEA is the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan - the Taliban's term for their new government. Earlier this month Afghan police also returned, operating checkpoints alongside Taliban forces. A police officer told news agency AFP he had been called back to work by the Taliban, who claim to have granted a general amnesty to everyone who worked for the previous regime. After the Taliban's takeover, Kabul airport was flooded by tens of thousands of Afghan nationals desperately looking to flee, as well as foreign nationals and aid workers waiting to be evacuated. The Indian government operated several such flights - in co-ordination with the Air Force and commercial airlines - bringing back hundreds of citizens, as well as refugees and foreigners. Heart-breaking scenes were witnessed at the height of the evacuation process, including the sight of a US Marine lifting a baby over a razor wire-topped wall at the airport. The airport was also attacked by suicide bombers who struck at one of its gates, killing at least 60; video shot by locals showed dozens of bodies strewn around a canal on the edge of the facility.   ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. With input from AFP, ANI, Reuters"

Now, Granted Asylum In Canada","Four Sri Lankan refugees who hid Edward Snowden in their tiny Hong Kong apartments when he was on the run after exposing NSA spying landed in Canada on Tuesday where they were granted asylum, ending years in limbo. Supun Thilina Kellapatha and Nadeeka Dilrukshi Nonis touched down in Toronto with their children Sethumdi and Dinath and were due to go on to Montreal to ""start their new lives,"" non-profit For the Refugees said in a statement. The family were part of a group of seven poverty-stricken refugees from Sri Lanka and the Philippines living in Hong Kong who nonetheless agreed to shelter Snowden after his bombshell revelations in 2013. Vanessa Rodel, from the Philippines, and her daughter Keana were granted asylum in Canada in 2019 with the help of For the Refugees, who have lobbied Canada to take in the others, arguing they faced persecution both in their homeland and in Hong Kong because they helped Snowden. Kellapatha's family had faced deportation after their initial refugee claims in Hong Kong were rejected. He spoke of his relief at finally finding a place of permanent sanctuary. ""I'm so happy this is over. I'm so happy to be going to Canada,"" the South China Morning Post quoted him as saying before he and his family boarded a plane in Hong Kong. ""We have a new life, our children now have a future. We're so grateful right now. Really, I am speechless... The kids are so happy. I'm so grateful.""  'One more' Snowden welcomed the news of the family's arrival in Canada. ""This is the best news I've heard in a long, long time,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""We need to bring one more home before we can say we're done, but I cannot thank you enough for bringing us this far,"" he added. A seventh member of the group, Sri Lankan army deserter Ajith Pushpakumara, remains in Hong Kong, where ""his safety is still at risk,"" according to For the Refugees, which renewed its call for Ottawa to expedite his asylum claim. ""We are happy with the end result -- at least for six of the seven,"" For the Refugees president Marc-Andre Seguin told AFP. ""Although we welcome the arrival and start of a new chapter in the lives of this family of four, we cannot ignore that Ajith has stayed behind,"" he said. ""We are asking that Canada (again) do the right thing and admit the last of Snowden's Guardian Angels before it's too late."" 'All alone' Robert Tibbo, Pushpakumara's lawyer in Canada, said his client has a pending application with Canadian immigration. ""The difficulty here is that Ajith is all alone right now and he's questioning why his case is taking so long,"" he told AFP. Tibbo himself left Hong Kong in 2017, saying he feared for his safety after representing the Snowden refugees in the Chinese business hub. Snowden revealed thousands of classified documents exposing vast US surveillance put in place after the September 11, 2001 attacks. He ended up stranded in Hong Kong as media published his findings, initially in a hotel, surrounded by journalists from around the globe. The group of refugees agreed to shelter him for about two weeks until he could fly to Russia, where he now lives. Their role in the saga was only revealed in a 2016 Oliver Stone film about Snowden, which left them in ""constant fear and worry"" in Hong Kong, said For the Refugees. It also highlighted the plight of refugees in Hong Kong, which has one of the lowest asylum approval rates in the world. Only around one percent of claims are granted and the tiny fraction of claimants that are approved must get ultimate sanctuary in a third country.

Speaking at a high-level UN event on 'Jobs and Social Protection for Poverty Eradication and a Sustainable Recovery'' on Tuesday, Kailash Satyarthi, the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize winner, gave a clarion call for bold and proactive leadership to end child labour and poverty. He said that USD 52 billion can provide social protection for every child and every pregnant woman in low income countries. ""That is not a big amount. This is just two days of COVID-19 relief measures as well as 0.4% of the social protection fund which is spent in rich countries,"" he said at the virtual event. ""We are not so poor. I refuse to accept that the world is so poor when 2,755 billionaires exist in this world. We have made progress when we didn't have enough resources, we helped children and declined child labour,"" he said, adding that the world of today is much more resourceful in technology and other areas. ""We did it in the past and we will do in the future. There is no dearth of bold ideas. But what we need is bold leadership in all spheres of life... compassion in leadership, courage in leadership and proactive leadership with a sense of urgency,"" he said. Mr Satyarthi noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated all the injustices and inequalities prevailing in the society and the worst sufferers have been the most marginalised children, particularly in developing, low-income and middle-income countries. He pointed out that many more children have been pushed into chronic poverty situations due to the pandemic. These children are out of school, denied health care, have no proper adequate access to safe drinking water or safe, clean air. ""They are the children who are sold and bought like animals and sometimes at lesser prices than animals,"" he said in his impassioned remarks. ""They are the children who are exploited as child labourers and are breaking their backs for our economies,"" he said. Underlining that ""these children are our children,"" Mr Satyarthi cautioned that if nations are not able to protect their children, most of the Sustainable Development Goals will not be accomplished. He voiced worry that even during the pre-pandemic years of 2016-2020, about 10,000 children were pushed into child labour every day. ""There is no excuse for that. There is no justification for that because it was the pre-pandemic time. This is not just apathy and insensitivity of the international community and all of us, including me and you. This is a crime against future of humanity,"" he said. He said the 160 million child labourers are ""160 million empty seats in the classrooms"" and these are children who are ""occupying 160 million jobs of adults."" Mr Satyarthi noted that even if the spending on education is adequate, ""nobody can bring these children to school"" untill additional efforts are made in freeing them from the ""clutches of their masters."" He underlined that social protection programmes will be successful especially for the children when ""we take swift and direct measures so that these children could be benefitted directly. Only then they will be freed from these situations."" According to the concept note of event, which was addressed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and several other world leaders and top UN officials, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to serve as a harsh reminder of the perils stemming from global inequities and a reminder of the urgency to redouble efforts towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda. ""The equivalent of an unprecedented 255 million jobs were lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to a sharp increase in poverty and inequalities. Declining labour income has been distributed unevenly between workers, with youth, women and low-skilled workers seeing the sharpest drops in disposable income,"" the concept note said. The High-Level event included a policy discussion to frame the ambitions needed for a socio-economic recovery to advance decent job creation, social protection and poverty eradication.   The event focussed on pressing issues including application of effective economic, social and environmental policies at country level through dialogue with social partners and other stakeholders; global norms and standards underpinning the socio-economic recovery and a just transition and current efforts to achieve just transitions in the context of ambitious climate action and the COVID-19 recovery and solutions that support accelerating and scaling up these efforts, particularly in developing countries.

The eight-division world champion and senator, who has his sights set on a high-stakes rumble to replace President Rodrigo Duterte, said quitting the sport that had lifted him out of poverty was the ""hardest decision"" of his life. ""It is difficult for me to accept that my time for me as a boxer is over,"" Pacquiao, 42, said in a video message on Twitter that quickly went viral. ""Today I am announcing my retirement."" It comes weeks after Pacquiao, considered one of the best boxers of all time, lost what turned out to be his last professional fight, against Cuban Yordenis Ugas in Las Vegas. Pacquiao, who entered politics in 2010 as a congressman before being elected to the Senate, said last week that he will make a tilt for the country's highest office. Pacquiao, a married father of five, thanked his millions of fans around the world, and paid special tribute to his long-time trainer Freddie Roach who he described as ""my family, a brother and a friend"". The decision ends weeks of speculation that Pacquiao was planning to retire after 26 years as a professional boxer. He ended with a 62-8 win-loss record and two draws. ""He's gonna go down as a legend of not just boxing but of the sporting world,"" Ted Lerner, a US-born sports journalist in the Philippines, told AFP. ""In the future... his name will be sort of synonymous with greatness, in the level of Michael Jordan or people who have transcended their sport and become like mythical legends."" In the video message, Pacquiao said boxing had given him ""the chance to fight my way out of poverty"" and ""the courage to change more lives"". ""I will never forget what I have done and accomplished in my life. I can't imagine I just heard the final bell,"" said Pacquiao, who retired briefly in 2016 before reversing the decision. Stopping traffic Pacquiao is idolised by many in the Philippines both for his punching power and rise from desperate street kid to the peak of boxing. He dropped out of high school at 14, sold doughnuts on the roadside and became a grocery stacker to help his mother support two younger siblings. Within a few years, the diminutive southpaw was a pro boxer. News of his retirement was greeted with mixed feelings in his southern hometown of General Santos, where support for the boxer runs deep. ""I am both happy and sad,"" Anna Rodriguez, 24, told AFP. ""I am happy because he will be able to spend more time with his family, but I'm also sad because he will no longer bring pride to General Santos."" As he prepares to register as a presidential candidate, Pacquiao has vowed to tackle poverty and corruption in a bid to win over voters with his rags-to-riches story. After two terms as a congressman and one as a senator, Pacquiao's ambition is not unrealistic in a country famed for its celebrity-obsessed politics. But victory is far from assured. Fans see Pacquiao as living proof that success is possible for anyone who works hard, no matter their origins. In his heyday, his fights stopped traffic and crime. But Pacquiao has stirred controversy as a politician, earning him plenty of detractors. Critics accuse the high-school dropout of lacking intellect and being a frequent no-show in the Senate, raising questions about his ability to run the country of 110 million people. Less than a year out from the elections, Pacquiao has risked political capital in a public battle with Duterte, who rivals the boxer for the affections of many Filipinos and previously mentioned him as a possible successor.   He has also stirred controversy by backing Duterte's deadly drug war, which rights groups say has killed tens of thousands of mostly poor men and sparked an investigation by the International Criminal Court.

Britain has been gripped by a rush of panic-buying for almost a week that has left pumps dry across major cities, after oil companies warned they did not have enough truck drivers to move petrol and diesel from refineries to filling stations. Johnson has sought to quell public concerns, saying supplies were returning to normal while also urging people not to panic buy. But in many regions, hundreds of forecourts remained closed and motorists were still snarled in queues waiting to fill their tanks. Reuters reporters saw lengthy queues outside gas stations from 0600 in north London and on the busy M25 orbital motorway circling the British capital along with warnings that no fuel was available at some sites. The gridlock has sparked calls for doctors, nurses and other essential workers to be given priority in filling their cars to keep hospitals and social care services running, a move Johnson has resisted. The government has put 150 British army tanker drivers on standby, and media reports suggested they could be deployed in the next few days. Industry groups said the worst of the fuel shortages seemed to be in London, the southeast and other English cities. Fights have broken out at some forecourts as drivers jostled for fuel and pictures on social media showed some people filling up old water bottles with fuel. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents independent fuel retailers who account for about two-thirds of all the 8,380 UK forecourts, said on Tuesday 37% of its members' gas stations were out of fuel. The shortages have added to an air of chaos in the world's fifth-largest economy after a dearth of truck drivers throughout the economy left gaps on supermarket shelves, while a spike in European wholesale natural gas prices has tipped energy companies into bankruptcy.   ""What we want to do is make sure that we have all the preparations necessary to get through until Christmas and beyond, not just in supplying the petrol stations but all parts of our supply chain,"" Johnson said.

The 64-year-old won the ruling party's leadership vote on Wednesday, beating popular vaccine chief Taro Kono to finally clinch a job he has long targeted. It was second time lucky for the experienced politician: he lost out in 2020 to Yoshihide Suga, who is stepping down after just a year as prime minister. Kishida is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands, despite a low-key presence that has sometimes been characterised as a lack of charisma. He has pledged to spend big on new pandemic stimulus while vowing to tackle income inequality and move away from the neo-liberal economics that have dominated Japanese politics for the past two decades. And seeking to set himself apart from the unpopular pandemic response of Suga's government, he has emphasised the lessons learned from his failure to win the leadership last time around. ""I wasn't good enough. I think I didn't have enough conviction,"" he admitted when he launched his campaign earlier this month. ""It's different this time. I'm standing here with a strong conviction that I am the leader needed at this time."" Kishida previously served as LDP policy chief and was foreign minister between 2012-17, during which he negotiated accords with Russia and South Korea, with whom Japan's relations are often frosty. He has called abolishing nuclear weapons ""my life's work"", and in 2016 helped bring then-US president Barack Obama to Hiroshima on a historic visit. But despite his liberal reputation, he has been less direct than Kono on social hot-button issues like gay marriage. Vaccine chief Kono said he backed same-sex marriage and called for it to be discussed in parliament. Kishida, however, said he had ""not reached the point for accepting same-sex marriage"", and took a softer stance than Kono on allowing married couples to keep separate surnames, another controversial issue. 'Politics of generosity' Tobias Harris, senior fellow for Asia at the Center for American Progress, said Kishida had been ""more flexible"" than Kono, ""certainly on foreign policy and security policy"". ""There are all sorts of things in his past that suggest that (Kishida's) conservative leanings are stronger than maybe he appeared,"" he added. Following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, Kishida entered politics in 1993, having previously worked at a bank as the Japanese economy boomed. As a child, his family lived for several years in New York where he suffered racism at school, an experience he says gave him a strong sense of justice, according to Harris. He is a big fan of the Hiroshima Carp baseball team, and is said to enjoy a drink -- unlike Suga, who is teetotal -- while his wife hails from a wealthy sake-brewing family. A keen baseball player at school, Kishida failed three times to pass the law entrance exam for Tokyo University, much to his parents' disappointment. He studied instead at Waseda, a prestigious private university in the capital that he reportedly chose for its serious, non-pretentious atmosphere. The father-of-three has touted his listening skills and says Japan's public wants a ""politics of generosity"". He has invited voters to leave him messages in a suggestion box and carried a notebook to events in which to scribble down ideas from the public.   But he hasn't always connected with the population and found himself roundly mocked during last year's leadership vote when he posted an awkwardly posed picture on Twitter of his wife serving him dinner in an apron.

A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said the chairperson of NGO, Suraz India Trust, Rajiv Daiya has been ""throwing mud"" at all and sundry including the court, administrative staff and the state government. ""The power to punish for contempt is a constitutional power vested with this court which cannot be taken away even by a legislative enactment,"" the court said.

The Supreme Court had issued contempt notice to Mr Daiya as to why he should not be proceeded against and sentenced for his endeavour to scandalise the court. Mr Daiya had told the bench that he did not have the resources to pay the costs imposed by the Supreme Court and would approach the President of India with a mercy plea.   The Supreme Court was hearing an application filed by Rajiv Daiya seeking recall of the Supreme Court's 2017 judgement by which it had imposed costs of ₹ 25 lakh on it for filing 64 PILs over the years without any success and ""repeatedly misusing"" the jurisdiction of the top court.

While fans can't wait to watch the movie, which features actor Daniel Craig in the lead, every piece of news about the film is keeping them on their toes. Amid all the excitement, the cast and several other A-listers arrived for the world premiere of the film at London's Royal Albert Hall on Tuesday. The official Instagram account of James Bond 007 shared pictures from the red carpet with celebrities bringing their fashion A-game to the event. Craig walked the red carpet for the last time as popular spy James Bond for the world premiere. The actor looked dapper sporting a berry-coloured velvet jacket for the star-studded event. Also in attendance were a duo of duchesses and a pair of princes, who brought royal glamour to the red carpet. Kate Middleton and Prince William joined Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall as guests of honour at the world premiere of the latest Bond movie. For the premiere, Middleton pulled out all the sartorial stops. The Duchess of Cambridge hit the red carpet in a glittering gold cape gown by Jenny Packham adorned with sequins and beadwork. Matching metallic pumps, gold circular statement earrings and an elegant updo completed Middleton's look for the night. Prince William went classic in a sharp black tux and bowtie. Prince Charles also sported a black tux and bowtie, while Camilla opted for a long-sleeved pale blue gown with scattered embellishments. Oscar-winning actor Rami Malek, who plays Bond villain Safin in the upcoming installment of the 007 franchise, arrived on the red carpet in a black tuxedo and we bet his female fandom is going weak in the knees! Actors Lashana Lynch, Lea Seydoux and Ana de Armas, who also feature in the Bond movie, glammed up for the starry premiere, as did Billie Eilish and brother Finneas O'Connell, who wrote and perform the ""No Time to Die"" theme song. One of the film's writers, Phoebe Waller-Bridge was also captured attending the event. The star looked stunning in an Azzaro sequin jumpsuit and ivory cape. Several other celebrities including Naomie Harris, Jason Momoa, Judi Dench, Stormzy, Michelle Yeoh, were also spotted in attendance for the premiere. Craig has played the iconic spy in four films so far - ""Casino Royale"", ""Quantum of Solace"", ""Skyfall"" and ""Spectre"", with the delayed ""No Time To Die"" wrapping up his time as James Bond, reported Variety. The film, helmed by Cary Fukanaga, will follow Bond who has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica. His peace is short-lived when his old friend Felix Leiter from the CIA turns up asking for help.   The mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology. ""No Time To Die"" will release in India on September 30."

The Thai tourism industry expects Indians to resume travel in large numbers next month during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, said Somsong Sachaphimukh, vice president of the Thai Tourism Council. That should help spark a tourism revival as it coincides with the planned waiver of quarantine for vaccinated visitors from Nov. 1, she said.    With the outbound Chinese travel not expected to resume anytime soon, Thailand is betting on travelers from other origins to take advantage of its relaxed rules for tourists. Indians, who made up the third-largest group of visitors to Thailand before the pandemic, may head again to Thai beaches for holidays, conferences and destination weddings, Somsong said.  ""If Thailand plans to reopen the country and many of our tourism hubs in November, this year's Diwali may be a great opportunity,"" Somsong told an online briefing on Tuesday. ""Indian travelers have a lot of spending power and a lot of potential."" Indian travelers may spend between 27,000 baht ($800) and 76,000 baht each during trips to Thailand, and each destination wedding could generate between 10 million to 120 million baht in revenue for the hotel and services industry, Somsong said. Almost 2 million Indians visited Thailand in 2019, generating 80 billion baht in tourism-related revenue, according to official data. They were the largest group behind Chinese and Malaysians that year when the nation saw almost 40 million tourists generating more than $60 billion in revenue. ""Even though it will be difficult to match the number of visitors and revenue generated by Chinese travelers, Indian tourists can help support Thailand's tourism industry during this time,"" Somsong said.    Thailand saw foreign tourist arrivals plunge to 73,932 in the first eight months of the year with the nation reeling under the worst Covid-19 outbreak that triggered widespread travel and business curbs. The pandemic has led to 3 million job losses in tourism sector, the council said, while slashing its tourist arrival forecast to 280,000 this year from 500,000 earlier.

Sales crashed last year in the second-biggest consumer after a nationwide lockdown shuttered stores across the country. But it also led to a bump in India's nascent market for online gold sales. That's pushed jewelers such as Tata Group's Tanishq, Kalyan Jewellers India Ltd., PC Jeweller Ltd. and Senco Gold and Diamonds to launch offers to sell gold for as little as 100 rupees ($1.35) either directly on their websites or through tie-ups with digital gold platforms. Consumers can take delivery once they have invested enough for at least 1 gram of gold. Digital gold sales aren't new to India, with mobile wallets and platforms like Augmont Gold For All, and World Gold Council-backed SafeGold offering the product. Jewelers had so far shied away from selling such products online, restricting them to their stores as the bulk of purchases in India are still made in person. ""Covid, obviously, has changed the mindset of a lot of jewelers and they have also been proactive in selling jewelry online. So this is just the extension of the whole mindset,"" said Ketan Kothari, director at Augmont Gold, which has more than 4,000 jewelers as partners. Festive Demand The jewelers have launched the offers just as the festive season begins in India, when gold demand peaks. Digital purchases are rising as more Indians warm up to buying via the internet. That, along with a more technology-friendly, younger generation of consumers is expected to boost the sector. ""We have been witnessing a renewed interest among consumers, especially youngsters, who are looking to make systematic investments in the yellow metal,"" according to Ramesh Kalyanaraman, executive director at Kalyan Jewellers. While online gold purchases, which includes the sale of ornaments on jewelers' websites, accounted for only about 2% of the overall sales value in 2019, the bulk of these transactions were made by people under the age of 45, according to a World Gold Council report last year.   A drop in gold prices has also boosted volumes on the platforms, said Gaurav Mathur, founder of SafeGold. said. People perceive the current gold prices to be low and they are more used to transacting digitally across categories and not just gold, he said. ""Since February last year, we have seen a 200% rise in sales on our platform with most consumers snapping up coins and bars in the range of 3,000 to 4,000 rupees,"" Augmont's Kothari said. ""During the pandemic, buying gold in the digital form has gained immense popularity and we expect sales to increase by 20%-30% this festive season compared with last year."""

Mr Gandhi - a Lok Sabha MP from the southern state - is on a pre-scheduled one-day visit to Kozhikode and Malappuram, during which he will interact with constituents and inaugurate projects. Source said he is scheduled to return to the national capital Thursday morning. Mr Gandhi's Kerala visit comes amid a (continuing) leadership crisis in Punjab - one of the few states the party still holds and one of seven that will vote for a new government next year. Questions have been raised over the timing of Mr Gandhi's visit, particularly since both Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were also away from Delhi when Mr Sidhu dropped his bombshell. The Congress leadership, though, has insisted that ""all is well"" in Punjab, despite the turmoil caused by the resignation of Mr Sidhu and Razia Sultana, one of the new cabinet ministers. The cabinet met Tuesday evening in Chandigarh and is expected to meet this morning too, and Punjab Congress General Secretary Pargat Singh has reportedly been tasked with pacifying Mr Sidhu. ""Nothing to worry, everything will be all right,"" senior leader KC Venugopal had said. If Navjot Sidhu cannot be persuaded to take his resignation back, a 'plan B' is already in motion. Reports indicate one of either Kuljit Singh Nagra (the Fatehgarh Sahib MLA) or Ravneet Singh Bittu (the Ludhiana MP) will be selected as Mr Sidhu's replacement. The Congress' dwindling sway over state-level politics is concerning ahead of the 2024 general election, and the party had hoped Mr Sidhu's appointment - after the Gandhi family overruled Amarinder Singh's objections - would steady the ship ahead of the Assembly election. Veteran Congress leader Amarinder Singh quit as Chief Minister 10 days ago, after a prolonged and bitter feud with Mr Sidhu over several issues. Mr Singh declared himself ""humiliated"" and warned the Congress about backing Navjot Sidhu; he called him ""dangerous for the state"" and said he would ""make any sacrifice"" to stop him. He also pulled no punches in his criticism of the Gandhi family. ""I was ready to leave after the victory but never after a loss... If she (Sonia Gandhi) had just called me and asked me to step down, I would have. As a soldier, I know how to do my task..."" he said. The ""Gandhi children"" - a reference to Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra - were ""quite inexperienced"" and their advisors were clearly misguiding them, the Captain also said.

Research from international development research lab AidData said that opaque deals with state banks and companies under President Xi Jinping's flagship investment drive -- the Belt and Road Initiative -- has left dozens of lower income governments strapped with debt that isn't on their balance sheets. China has invested more than $843 billion to build roads, bridges, ports and hospitals in some 163 nations since the programme was announced in 2013, including many countries across Africa and Central Asia. Nearly 70 percent of this money has been lent to state banks or joint ventures between Chinese businesses and local partners in countries that were already deeply indebted to Beijing, AidData executive director Brad Parks told AFP. ""Many poor governments could not take on any more loans,"" Parks said. ""So (China) got creative."" He said loans were given to a ""constellation of actors other than central governments"" but often backed by a government guarantee to pay up if the other party couldn't. ""The contracts are murky, and governments themselves don't know the exact monetary values they owe to China,"" he said. These under-reported debts are worth about $385 billion, the study found. AidData, which is based at the College of William and Mary in Virginia, listed 45 lower and middle income countries which now have levels of debt exposure to China higher than 10 percent of their national gross domestic product. Resentment has been fuelled about high levels of Chinese money flowing into places such as Balochistan in southwest Pakistan, where locals say they get little benefit and militants have launched a string of attacks aimed at undermining Chinese investment. ""What we're seeing right now with the Belt and Road Initiative is buyers' remorse,"" Parks said. ""Many foreign leaders who were initially eager to jump on the BRI bandwagon are now suspending or cancelling Chinese infrastructure projects because of debt sustainability concerns."" Beijing's lending spree has slowed over the past two years due to pushback from borrowers, the study said. The Group of Seven wealthy nations also announced a rival scheme to counter Beijing's dominance in global lending this year. Beijing's loans demanded higher interest rates with shorter repayment periods, AidData found.   Parks said their research concluded the BRI was ""not a grand scheme to build alliances"", as is sometimes portrayed by Beijing, but rather China ""hunting for the most profitable project.""

The Munich-based luxury electric vehicle unit had in 2019 rolled out a prototype of its 1,900-horsepower Battista, which had a top speed of 350 km/hour and a range up to 500 km in a single charge. Mahindra's options include a merger with a blank-check company and a potential overseas listing of the EV supercar business. It could seek to value the unit at around $500 million in any deal, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The company declined to comment on the report, while Automobili Pininfarina did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment outside business hours. Automobili Pininfarina originally planned to build 150 cars beginning 2020, but now deliveries are due to start early in 2022, the report said, citing a spokesperson for Automobili Pininfarina. Mahindra bought a 76.06% stake in Turin-based Pininfarina, the designer of some of the most iconic Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and Maserati models, in 2015 for $28 million.   As part of its push to become a key player in the high-end electric vehicles segment, it set up Munich-based Automobili Pininfarina in 2018.

The towers house over 900 flats and were ordered to be demolished over the violation of construction by-laws. ""Demolish only one tower,"" petitioned Supertech, arguing that it will save crores of rupees. The real estate giant in its plea informed the court that it has decided to modify the project which will also be ""beneficial for the environment"". ""If the modifications are allowed, it would save crores of resources from going to waste in as much as the applicant has already put materials worth crores of rupees in the construction of the two towers. The construction of the two towers has consumed steel and cement in huge quantities apart from various other materials, including human labour amounting to several crores of rupees which shall be rendered complete waste in the form of scrap,"" the developer stated in  its plea. The developer said demolition would leave a massive quantity of debris that will have to be dumped at a landfill site that is already overburdened. ""The same will add to the existing environmental issues which are already being faced by the said landfill sites, thus, further increasing the existing carbon footprint,"" stated Supertech. Earlier, slamming the towers' illegal construction, the top court had ruled that there was collusion and an ""unholy nexus"" between Noida (New Okhla Industrial Development Area) authorities and the builders. The top court had further ruled that the people who had bought homes in these projects must be refunded in two months, and the cost of demolition be borne by Supertech.   The court also demanded to know why and how the Noida authorities, in their ""eternal wisdom"", permitted large construction projects such as this in a designated 'green area'. The two towers - Apex and Ceyane - of Supertech's Emerald Court Project - together have 915 apartments and 21 shops. Of these, initially, 633 flats were booked."

Mr Gandhi - a Lok Sabha MP from the southern state - is on a pre-scheduled one-day visit to Kozhikode and Malappuram, during which he will interact with constituents and inaugurate projects. Source said he is scheduled to return to the national capital Thursday morning. Mr Gandhi's Kerala visit comes amid a (continuing) leadership crisis in Punjab - one of the few states the party still holds and one of seven that will vote for a new government next year. Questions have been raised over the timing of Mr Gandhi's visit, particularly since both Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were also away from Delhi when Mr Sidhu dropped his bombshell. The Congress leadership, though, has insisted that ""all is well"" in Punjab, despite the turmoil caused by the resignation of Mr Sidhu and Razia Sultana, one of the new cabinet ministers. The cabinet met Tuesday evening in Chandigarh and is expected to meet this morning too, and Punjab Congress General Secretary Pargat Singh has reportedly been tasked with pacifying Mr Sidhu. ""Nothing to worry, everything will be all right,"" senior leader KC Venugopal had said. If Navjot Sidhu cannot be persuaded to take his resignation back, a 'plan B' is already in motion. Reports indicate one of either Kuljit Singh Nagra (the Fatehgarh Sahib MLA) or Ravneet Singh Bittu (the Ludhiana MP) will be selected as Mr Sidhu's replacement. The Congress' dwindling sway over state-level politics is concerning ahead of the 2024 general election, and the party had hoped Mr Sidhu's appointment - after the Gandhi family overruled Amarinder Singh's objections - would steady the ship ahead of the Assembly election. Veteran Congress leader Amarinder Singh quit as Chief Minister 10 days ago, after a prolonged and bitter feud with Mr Sidhu over several issues. Mr Singh declared himself ""humiliated"" and warned the Congress about backing Navjot Sidhu; he called him ""dangerous for the state"" and said he would ""make any sacrifice"" to stop him. He also pulled no punches in his criticism of the Gandhi family. ""I was ready to leave after the victory but never after a loss... If she (Sonia Gandhi) had just called me and asked me to step down, I would have. As a soldier, I know how to do my task..."" he said. The ""Gandhi children"" - a reference to Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra - were ""quite inexperienced"" and their advisors were clearly misguiding them, the Captain also said.   After the Sidhu shocker, Mr Singh lost no time in saying ""I told you so...""; he tweeted: ""I told you so...he is not a stable man and not fit for the border state of Punjab."" Mr Singh is currently in Delhi on a ""personal"" visit; reports he had lined up a meeting with BJP chief JP Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah were dismissed yesterday by his media advisor."

""My fight is issue-based and I have stood by it for a long time. I cannot compromise with my ethics, my moral authority. What I witness is a compromise with issues, agenda in Punjab. I cannot misguide the high command nor can I let them be misguided,"" Mr Sidhu said in Punjabi, defending a move that has raised questions about the Gandhis' decisions and their faith in him. He added in the four-minute video: ""I have no personal rivalry with anyone. Seventeen years of my political career has been for a purpose, to make a difference, to take a stand and to make people's lives better. This is my only religion."" Backed by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Mr Sidhu set the stage for Amarinder Singh's resignation as Punjab Chief Minister on September 18 and Charanjit Singh Channi's takeover, just four months before the state election. But Mr Channi's decisions on the appointment of ministers and other officials nettled Mr Sidhu, who found that his hold on the new government was not a vast improvement on what it had been under Amarinder Singh. ""I will make any sacrifice to stand by principles. I don't need to think much for it. I broke the system where tainted ministers and officers were accommodated. Now tainted ministers and officers can't be appointed again. I oppose such appointments,"" Mr Sidhu said. Apparently referring to senior IPS officer Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, who has been given additional charge as Punjab Police chief, Mr Sidhu said, ""When I see those who gave clean chit to Badals six years back...such people have been given the responsibility for delivering justice."" Mr Sahota was the head of a Special Investigation Team formed in 2015 by the then Akali government to probe the sacrilege incidents or the desecration of the Sikh religious text Guru Granth Sahib. Mr Sidhu also apparently questioned the appointment of APS Deol as the state's new Advocate General. ""Those who secured blanket bails are advocate general,"" he said. Mr Deol has been a counsel for former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini, an accused in cases involving police firing on protesters in 2015. The cricketer-turned-politician is also upset at Rana Gurjit Singh being included in the cabinet again. Mr Singh had been accused of a role in a sand mining scam and quit the Amarinder Singh cabinet in 2018. He was later cleared by an inquiry panel.   Mr Sidhu was reportedly also against the key home ministry being assigned to Deputy Chief Minister SS Randhawa, his rival. He has reportedly refused to reconsider his resignation, forcing the party to look for options to replace him."

You Could End Up Paying More Than You Ever Did,"Cotton futures raced past $1 a pound for the first time in nearly a decade as adverse weather and shipping snags threaten supplies, driving up costs for clothing around the world.  Crops in several key-growing countries are seeing problems, from rain-drenched fields in the U.S. to bollworm-infested ones in India. At the same time, cotton buyers need more of the fiber. Mexico and China are buying record amounts. Also causing trouble for supplies are high freight rates and geopolitics, with international backlash about labor violations in Xinjiang, China's biggest producing region. The U.S. banned imports earlier this year.  All of this is coming together to drive up prices, which means the cost of making clothing will be on the rise. That will squeeze margins for apparel makers like Levi Strauss & Co., and result in inflation for everything from T-shirts to jeans if retailers try to pass on the expense to consumers.   In New York, the contract for December delivery climbed as much as 3.6% to $1.0155 a pound, the highest since November 2011. The price has surged 28% this year. Gains are being intensified by traders rushing to cover short positions. With cotton projected to see a second year of global supply deficits, traders are focusing on an updated figure for the shortfall that is due this week from researcher Cotlook.  While the spike to $1 is psychologically significant, the rally likely won't surpass the $2 level reached in 2011, said Louis Rose, a director of research for Rose Commodity Group in Tennessee.  ""Ten years prior, China was virtually out of cotton -- not so this time,"" said Rose, who previously worked for Cargill Inc.   The fundamentals aren't in place for a doubling in cotton prices, said John Robinson, an economist at Texas A&M's AgriLife Extension in College Station. While supply chain disruptions are hurting cotton, U.S. production fears are overhyped, he said.    ""Since Friday this run-up has been from speculator buying, and that can turn around as fast as it started,"" he said.

Investors who are male, over the age of 45, married or consider themselves as having ""excellent investment experience"" are more likely to ""freak out"" and dump their portfolio during a downturn, according to a paper published last month that analyzed more than 600,000 brokerage accounts. The researchers say their work can be used to create predictive models, which would help identify individuals at risk of panic selling. ""Financial advisors have long advised their clients to stay calm and weather any passing financial storm in their portfolios,"" wrote Daniel Elkind, Kathryn Kaminski, Andrew Lo and colleagues. ""Despite this, a percentage of investors tend to freak out and sell off a large portion of their risky assets."" The extreme emotional swings of being a stock-market investor has long fascinated behavioral scientists. While the MIT study didn't explore why exactly investors panic sell, the intense fear and desire to give up and get out of the market is well-known to any trader. Countless studies have shown that people are better off staying put in a broad diversified portfolio, yet the promise of big riches and the terror of losing it all continues to drive frenetic trading patterns.  In the study, the researchers defined a panic sale as a plunge of 90% of a household account's equity assets over the course of one month, of which 50% or more is due to trades. ""Panic sales are not random events,"" the researchers wrote, saying its possible to identify clear trends in the data. They found that specific types of investors, such as those with less than $20,000 in their portfolio, also tend to liquidate more often.   ""Subtle patterns in portfolio history, past market movements, and demographic profile can be exploited by deep neural networks to accurately predict if an investor will panic sell in the near future,"" they added.

Former Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha said ""someone in Delhi needs to be sacked"" for the tumultuous turns of events in the party's Punjab unit. BJP spokesperson Gaurav Goel said the Congress is now a party ""with no leader"". The Aam Aadmi Party (AAM) in Punjab said the Indian National Congress has become ""Indian National Circus"". On a lighter vein, another user called for a Netflix web series to break down what exactly was happening in Punjab politics. Hundreds of memes too did the rounds online. People joked about how Mr Sidhu might return to the 'The Kapil Sharma Show'' and take back his position. They also shared memes about actor and TV personality Archana Puran Singh and imagined her funny reaction to the news.  Mr Sidhu, 57, announced his resignation shortly after the allocation of portfolios to the new ministers in Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi's cabinet. He was appointed the party's state unit president on July 18 amid a bitter power tussle with Amarinder Singh, who stepped down as the Chief Minister 10 days ago while accusing the party high command of humiliating him.

Stern spoke to Reuters from aboard a plane his group chartered from Kam Air, a private Afghan airline, that he said had been sitting for 14 hours at Abu Dhabi airport after arriving from Kabul with 117 people, including 59 children. His group is one of several that emerged from ad hoc networks of U.S. military veterans, current and former U.S. officials and others that formed to bolster last month's U.S. evacuation operation they saw as chaotic and badly organized. DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were unfamiliar with the matter, but that the U.S. government typically takes time to verify the manifests of charter planes before clearing them to land in the United States. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has said its top priority is repatriating Americans and green card holders unable to leave Afghanistan in the U.S. evacuation operation last month. A senior State Department official on Monday said the United States was aware of about 100 American citizens and legal permanent residents ready to leave Afghanistan. Six Americans, 83 green card holders and six people with U.S. Special Immigration Visas granted to Afghans who worked for the U.S. government during the 20-year war in Afghanistan were aboard the Kam Air flight, Stern said. He had planned to transfer the passengers to a chartered Ethiopian Airlines plane for an onward flight to the United States that he said the Customs cleared to land at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. Customs then changed the clearance to Dulles International Airport outside Washington before denying the plane landing rights anywhere in the United States, he said.

Navjot Sidhu's resignation within two months of taking over the vital post was ""sheer drama"" and suggests that he is preparing to quit the Congress and join hands with another party ahead of polls early next year, the former Punjab Chief Minister said on Tuesday. Earlier, he had tweeted: ""I told you so...he is not a stable man and not fit for the border state of Punjab."" He called Mr Sidhu a ""shifty character"", typical of someone who had ""deserted the Indian team in 1996 in England"". ""That's what his real character is.

""I had been saying all along that this man is unstable and dangerous, and cannot be entrusted with the task of running Punjab,"" said the Captain, repeating that Mr Sidhu had been ""absolutely incompetent"" during his stint as a minister in his government. Punjab is a sensitive state sharing over 600 km of border with a hostile Pakistan, said Mr Singh, adding that ""Sidhu's close links with his cricketer friend Imran Khan (Pakistan Prime Minister) and ISI chief Qamar Javed Bajwa are a serious threat to India's national security"". Describing Mr Sidhu as a ""flamboyant"" speaker, the former Chief Minister said his entertaining talk at public meetings was all froth and no substance. ""People don't vote for buffoonery"", he said, adding that no one takes him (Mr Sidhu) seriously. Mr Sidhu is believed to have quit because he was upset with the decisions on ministers taken by new Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, ironically seen to be his man.  ""What nonsense is this! Cabinet formation is the prerogative of the chief minister, so why should Sidhu interfere in it,"" Amarinder Singh reacted.   On Mr Sidhu's asserting that he was quitting on matters of principle, the Captain remarked: ""What principles is he talking about? He's only making grounds to quit the Congress. You wait and see, he will join hands with some other party very soon"".  Mr Singh is in Delhi for the first time since he resigned as Chief Minister, complaining to the Congress leadership about being humiliated, and there is intense speculation that he will meet with BJP leaders.

""I told you so... he is not a stable man and not fit for the border state of Punjab,"" tweeted the 79-year-old, whose exit as Chief Minister was ascribed to Navjot Sidhu. Navjot Sidhu's shocker coincided with Amarinder Singh's trip to Delhi and furious speculation that he would meet with BJP leaders Amit Shah and JP Nadda. The Captain, however, told reporters he had come to the city only to vacate the Kapurthala Home for Charanjit Singh Channi, his successor. ""I will go home, collect my belongings, and return to Punjab tomorrow. I won't meet any politician, I am just here to vacate my home,"" he told reporters. Mr Singh's aide had also tweeted a denial. ""Too much being read into Captain Amarinder's visit to Delhi. He's on a personal visit, during which he'll meet some friends and also vacate Kapurthala house for the new Chief Minister. No need for any unnecessary speculation,"" tweeted Raveen Thukral. For the Captain, who resigned on September 18 citing repeated humiliation by the party, vindication came much sooner than he may have expected. Just two days after he quit, the Congress replaced him with Charanjit Singh Channi, who was seen to be close to Navjot Sidhu. After being forced out, Mr Singh gave a flurry of interviews calling Navjot Sidhu a ""drama master"" and ""dangerous for Punjab"". He also criticised Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, calling them ""inexperienced and misguided"" for backing Mr Sidhu.   ""I would not have taken MLAs on a flight to Goa or some place. That is not how I operate. I don't do gimmicks, and the Gandhi siblings know that is not my way... Priyanka and Rahul are like my children... this should not have ended like this. I am hurt,"" he had said. Questioning Mr Sidhu's competence, he had accused him of not clearing a single file as state minister."

The snarl-ups at Vietnam's factories are part of a broader crisis around the planet that is sending inflation surging and raising concerns about the pace of recovery in the global economy. At a fabric mill east of Hanoi, Claudia Anselmi -- the Italian director of Hung Yen Knitting & Dyeing, a key cog in the supply chain of several European and US clothing giants -- worries daily if the factory can keep the lights on. Its output plunged by 50 percent when Vietnam's latest devastating virus wave first struck in spring, and it faces perpetual problems securing the yarn it needs for its synthetic material. ""At first we were lacking people (to work) because everyone was stuck at home,"" said Anselmi, whose company's fabric is later used in swimwear and sportswear for customers including Nike, Adidas and Gap. Now, ""travel restrictions have jeopardised all logistics in and out... this has created long, long delays,"" she told AFP. ""We only survive if we have the stock."" While lockdowns are gradually loosening across the country as infections steadily decline, millions of Vietnamese have been under stay-at-home orders for months. And a complex web of checkpoints and confusing travel permit regulations have made life impossible for truck drivers and businesses trying to move goods across, as well and in and out of, the country. Hamza Harti, managing director at FM Logistic Vietnam, said several drivers in the Mekong Delta had been forced to wait three days and nights in their vehicle to enter the city of Can Tho. ""They were without food, without anything,"" he told a French Chamber of Commerce panel discussion in Hanoi. Shifting production The delays and restrictions are a major headache for foreign businesses, many of which have pivoted to Southeast Asia from China in recent years -- a trend accelerated by the bruising trade war between Washington and Beijing. In the south -- the epicentre of Vietnam's fight against Covid-19 -- up to 90 percent of supply chains in the garment sector were broken, the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association (Vitas) said in August, according to state media. Nike -- which warned last week it was struggling with shortages of its athletic gear and cut its sales forecasts -- pointed the finger at Vietnam, among others, saying 80 percent of its factories in the south and nearly half of its apparel plants in the country had shut their doors. The sports colossus sources around half of its footwear from the communist country. Although some factories were able to set up a system where staff could eat, work and sleep on site to get around lockdown restrictions, Vitas said that the cost was prohibitive for many. Japan's Fast retailing, which owns the popular Uniqlo brand, also blamed the situation in Vietnam for hold-ups on sweaters, sweatpants, hoodies and dresses, while Adidas said supply chain issues -- including in the country -- could cost it as much as 500 million euros ($585 million) in sales by the end of the year. Even with the prospect of lockdowns easing, many are fretting over the long-term impact on Vietnamese manufacturing, with Nike and Adidas admitting they were looking to temporarily produce elsewhere. In a letter to Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, leading business associations representing the United States, the European Union, South Korea and Southeast Asian nations sounded the alarm over production shifting away from Vietnam, warning 20 percent of its manufacturing members had already left. ""Once production shifts, it is difficult to return,"" they wrote. Nguyen Thi Anh Tuyet, deputy general director of Maxport Vietnam, whose 6,000 workers churn out activewear for the likes of Lululemon, Asics and Nike, told AFP the firm had ""been very worried"" about clients withdrawing orders -- even though it was one of the lucky few to have navigated recent brutal months largely unscathed. Without foreign customers ""our workers would become jobless"", she said. Coffee, cars The pandemic has not only hit the country's textile industry but is also threatening global coffee supplies, with Vietnam the world's largest producer of robusta beans -- the variety used in instant coffee. Prices for the commodity are now sitting at a four-year high. Car companies have not escaped either -- Toyota slashed production for September and October owing partly to virus issues, telling AFP ""the impact has been big in Vietnam"", as well as Malaysia. Shortages have been made worse by a rise in demand in the West after a virus-induced slump. Back at her textile mill near Hanoi, Anselmi believes companies will stick with Vietnam if it can return to some kind of normality in October.   ""If we can allow the factories to work then I think the trust (in Vietnam) is still there."" (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

In a tweet this morning, the Gorakhpur police said an FIR has been filed against the suspended policemen based on a complaint by the wife of the dead businessman. The police have confirmed that a murder case has been filed against the six cops. Rs 10 lakh will be paid as compensation to the businessman's family as directed by the Chief Minister, said police. Condemning the tragic turn of events, former Chief Minister and opposition leader Akhilesh Yadav blamed it on the ""culture of encounters"" - a practice, he claims, started by the BJP in the state. The victim's family has alleged that the businessman was assaulted while the police maintain the man's death was an 'accident'. He fell inside the hotel room, say police. The dead man has been identified as Manish Kumar Gupta, a resident of Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur. He and two other people from different cities were in the hotel room at the time of the raid that took place Monday midnight. The people with the victim told media that they were business associates and had come to Gorakhpur to meet a common friend. ""The three of us were sleeping in our room. Around 12:30 am, the doorbell rang. I opened the door and there were 5-7 policemen there and the boy from the reception. They came inside the room and started asking us for IDs. I showed my ID and then woke up Manish. He asked the cops why we were being troubled this late at night. The cops then started threatening us,"" Harveer Singh, one of the men who was inside the hotel room, said to reporters. Mr Singh told the media he lives in Haryana's Gurgaon. ""They appeared drunk. I was slapped by one of the policemen. Some of the policemen had guns. The cops then took me outside. A while later, I saw Manish was being dragged out of the room by the cops and there was blood all over his face,"" he added. The Gorakhpur Police claim they had received information about 'suspicious' men staying at the hotel. ""The men were from different cities. The police team found this suspicious, so they went up to the room along with the hotel manager. One of the men died in an accident inside the room in an unfortunate manner. Our team immediately shifted him to a hospital,"" Vipin Tada, the police chief of Gorakhpur said in a statement. It is not clear if late night raids at city hotels are part of regular policing in the city The victim's wife told the media she was not convinced with the police's explanation.   ""Just 10 minutes before his death, he was speaking to me and then he cut the call saying the cops are here. I believe he later called another relative saying the police were harassing and threatening him and asking him to accompany them to the police station. I want answers to how he died,"" Meenakshi Gupta, the wife of the dead property dealer, said in a statement. "

Mr Singh had refused to answer questions about joining BJP -- but while resigning as the Chief Minister earlier this month, had spoken of exploring options. Earlier in the day, Navjot Singh Sidhu has resigned as Punjab Congress chief, delivering a big shock to the Gandhis, who may have hoped that changing Chief Ministers would help end the turmoil in the state before elections early next year. In a video message tweeted this morning, a day after his shock resignation as Punjab Congress Chief, Mr Sidhu said that he will not compromise on ethics and would ""fight for truth until my last breath."" ""My fight is issue-based and I have stood by it for a long time. I cannot compromise with my ethics, my moral authority. What I witness is a compromise with issues, agenda in Punjab. I cannot misguide the high command nor can I let them be misguided,"" Mr Sidhu said in Punjabi. The cricketer-turned-politician tweeted a resignation letter that hinted at his unhappiness at the ongoing changes to the Punjab cabinet. ""The collapse of a man's character stems from the compromise corner. I can never compromise on Punjab's future and the agenda for the welfare of Punjab. Therefore, I hereby resign as the President of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. I will continue to serve the Congress,"" Navjot Sidhu, 57, wrote in his letter to Sonia Gandhi, which he posted on social media. He had taken charge of the party in Punjab in July. Navjot Sidhu, say sources, was also unhappy about his rival SS Randhawa being assigned a key ministry. The double use of the word ""compromise"" in Mr Sidhu's resignation letter was read as a clue that he was asked to accept some unpleasant choices in the cabinet shuffle."

Milley, 63, was unshaken as Republicans called for his resignation during an already contentious hearing that was meant to focus on the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan - but repeatedly swerved into questions regarding the general. When asked, Milley acknowledged talking to Washington Post author Bob Woodward for a book that showcased Milley's role trying to avert a crisis over apparent Chinese fears that Trump might attack Beijing in his final months in office. The book detailed supposedly ""secret"" calls with General Li Zuocheng of the People's Liberation Army on Oct. 30, 2020 and again on Jan. 8, and said Milley had promised to warn China first if he were ordered to attack. Milley confirmed the calls but said they were not secret to U.S. government officials and that he was acting on instructions from some of Trump's top aides to de-escalate tensions. He acknowledged trying to send a message that ""we are not going to attack you"" following U.S. intelligence indicating Beijing feared an attack. Republican Senator Dan Sullivan challenged Milley, insinuating he would be executed for that kind of behavior in China. ""If the head of the PLA called you and said, 'Hey, we're getting ready to invade Taiwan' and (Chinese President) Xi Jinping found out about it, he'd be shot,"" Sullivan said, referring to China's People's Liberation Army. Milley said the calls were part of his mandate to ensure strategic stability. ""I know, I am certain, President Trump did not intend on attacking the Chinese and it is my directed responsibility to convey presidential orders and intent,"" Milley told the Senate Armed Services Committee. Trump, who has said Milley should be fired if the acounts were true, issued a statement after the hearing ridiculing the Army general. ""No wonder the Afghanistan withdrawal was such a disaster. 'General' Milley spent all of his time talking to these Fake Book writers,"" Trump said. Senator Angus King, an independent committee member who caucuses with Democrats, praised Milley. ""I think he was rendering the country a significant service,"" King told reporters on a conference call after the hearing. The committee's Democratic chairman, Senator Jack Reed, also told reporters that de-escalating international tensions was part of Milley's job. 'HE'S CRAZY' Milley acknowledged that he also spoke on Jan. 8 with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who, according to the Washington Post, had asked the general what safeguards were in place to prevent an ""unstable president"" from launching a nuclear strike. ""He's crazy. You know he's crazy,"" Pelosi told Milley, the newspaper reported, citing a transcript of the call. Milley, in his remarks to Congress, said Pelosi had asked him on Jan. 8 about whether Trump's actions might lead to an accidental nuclear missile launch. He responded by assuring her of safeguards and added: ""I am not qualified to determine the mental health of the President of the United States."" Milley told the Armed Services Committee: ""At no time was I attempting to change or influence the process, usurp authority, or insert myself into the chain of command."" President Joe Biden has supported Milley throughout the controversy surrounding the calls, saying he had ""great confidence"" in him. But it is not the first time the top U.S. military officer has been caught in the spotlight. Last year, Milley caused an uproar after accompanying Trump toward a church for a photo opportunity just after authorities cracked down on civil rights protesters. He later said he regretted it, saying the incident created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics. In one exchange on Tuesday, Milley acknowledged also speaking with two other sets of book authors. Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn lashed out at him.   ""In order to get your name in a book... all you have managed to do is to politicize the U.S. military, to downgrade our reputation with our allies,"" Blackburn said.

The regional government of the Spanish archipelago had already declared an exclusion zone of two nautical miles around where the lava was expected to enter the Atlantic and asked nearby residents to stay at home. ""The lava flow has reached the sea at Playa Nueva,"" the Canary Islands Volcanic Institute (Involcan) said on Twitter Tuesday night. La Cumbre Vieja volcano, which straddles a southern ridge in La Palma, an island with 85,000 inhabitants, erupted on September 19, spewing out rivers of lava that have slowly crept towards the sea. Residents of several areas of Tazacorte, a village near the coast, were told Monday to stay at home to avoid harm from the release of toxic gases that can take place due to a reaction between molten lava and water. On Tuesday afternoon, the slow-moving lava flow, which has varied in speed over the past few days, even halting at one point, was still around 800 metres (half a mile) from the coast, making it impossible to predict when it would reach the ocean. Residents were warned to stay home due to ""the possibility that there will be a small shock when the magma enters the sea water, and that this small shock causes vapours which can be toxic,"" stressed Miguel Angel Morcuende, technical director of the Canary Islands Volcanic Emergency Plan (Pevolca). Experts say the entry of lava into the seawater will send clouds of toxic gas into the air, causing explosions and a fragmentation of the molten rock like gunshots. ""Inhalation or contact with acid gases and liquids can irritate the skin, eyes and respiratory tract, and may cause breathing difficulties, especially in people with pre-existing respiratory diseases,"" Involcan warned. A state of natural disaster has been declared on the island, where the molten rock has so far scorched its way across more than 258 hectares (640 acres) of land and destroyed 589 properties -- not all of them homes, according to the European Union's Copernicus Earth Observation Programme. The government earlier Tuesday released 10.5 million euros ($12.3 million) in aid for victims of the eruption, in particular to buy housing for those whose homes were engulfed in lava. The eruption has forced the evacuation of more than 6,000 people from their homes but has not killed or injured anyone so far.   The island of La Palma lives mainly from the cultivation of bananas and tourism. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

The report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) came from more than 22,000 people who signed up to a vaccine safety smartphone app and who received a booster shot between August 12 and September 19. During this time, third doses were authorized for people who are immunocompromised, but not the wider population. ""The frequency and type of side effects were similar to those seen after the second vaccine doses, and were mostly mild or moderate and short lived,"" CDC director Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing. Frequently reported side effects included injection site pain (71 percent of study participants), fatigue (56 percent), and headache (43 percent). Some 28 percent reported being unable to perform normal daily activities, usually the next day. Medical care was sought by around two percent of participants, and 0.1 percent, that is 13 people, were hospitalized. A subset of almost 21,700 who received the same mRNA vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer) for all three of their doses was further analyzed. Among those who received Moderna, localized reactions -- such as arm pain -- were reported to be slightly more common after the third dose compared to the second. Systemic reactions -- meaning those that occurred outside the injection site -- were slightly less frequent after the third dose compared to the second. The same pattern occurred for Pfizer, and in both cases, the first shots resulted in significantly less frequent side effects, especially systemic, compared to shots two and three. Last week, US health agencies expanded authorization of Pfizer booster doses to those aged over 65, those 18-64 with an underlying medical condition such as diabetes or obesity, and those who are especially exposed to the virus because of their work or where they live. The CDC cautioned that there were certain limitations to its report. These include the fact that signing up to the smartphone app called ""v-safe"" was voluntary and the participants skewed more heavily white than the national population.   During the study period, some non-immune compromised may have also received a booster outside of recommendations because they were worried about waning immunity, and so the findings can't reliably be linked to immune compromised people only.

Biden had been meant to address his Covid-19 vaccination policy in the Midwestern city, but his two signature legislative policies -- a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and an even bigger social spending package -- risk failing in the divided legislature. ""He will now remain at the White House tomorrow to continue working on advancing these two pieces of legislation to create jobs,"" an administration official said late Tuesday. Lawmakers were also scrambling to break a deadlock over the prospect of a first-ever US debt default that would plunge the economy into a downwards spiral, alarming investors as the cliff edge draws closer. The government is likely to run out of cash on October 18, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned, unless Congress raises the federal borrowing cap. After that date, Treasury's funds ""would be depleted quickly"" and ""it is uncertain whether we could continue to meet all the nation's commitments after that date,"" she said in a letter to congressional leaders. The impasse fueled a selloff on Wall Street, with the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 1.6 percent lower after Yellen warned of dire consequences including debt default if lawmakers fail to act quickly. But Republicans say they won't help raise or suspend the debt limit, despite having pressed for it under Donald Trump, because they want no part in Democrats' spending plans, including a historically large $3.5 trillion package of social reforms. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, whose Democrats occupy half the 100 seats in the upper chamber, attempted to raise the borrowing cap until December 2022 without any Republican votes. He asked for the unanimous consent of the Senate to bypass the usual 60-vote threshold required for most bills to be debated and instead move straight to a vote. - 'Partisan socialism' - ""Republicans said they want to get it done with only Democratic votes. Democrats are ready to do it and let's have that vote today,"" Schumer said. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell refused, insisting there was ""no chance the Republican conference will go out of our way to help Democrats conserve their time and energy so they can resume ramming through partisan socialism as fast as possible."" The cap was reinstated on August 1 with the country's debt at $28.4 trillion. McConnell has repeatedly argued that the political burden of raising or suspending it again should fall to Democrats because they control the House, Senate and White House. But Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee the debt limit increase was a ""shared responsibility"" that both parties should support. Without an increase, the government would be unable to pay salaries of public workers or service the nation's debt while confidence in the dollar as a reserve currency would be undermined, she said. With no sign of a way out of the impasse, the debt crisis may now be kicked into next week, with lawmakers facing a more immediate deadline on funding the government past Thursday, when the fiscal year ends. Failure would shut down the government, which typically leads to hundreds of thousands of workers being sent home as public services are closed. - 'Serious harm' - The House has passed a ""continuing resolution"" to keep the lights on until December 3. But the Senate shot down the plan on Monday, with Republicans objecting to a debt ceiling hike that was included in the wording. Raising the debt limit does not increase spending, but simply allows Treasury to finance projects already approved by Congress, including trillions of dollars in aid rolled out during the pandemic. In her latest letter to lawmakers, Yellen said prompt approval is critical since ""waiting until the last minute can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise borrowing costs for taxpayers and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States for years to come.""

Purchases of Iranian oil by Chinese companies are believed to have helped keep Iran's economy afloat despite U.S. sanctions that are designed to choke off such sales to put pressure on Iran to curb its nuclear program. ""We are aware of the purchases that Chinese companies are making of Iranian oil,"" said a senior U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""We have used our sanctions authorities to respond to Iranian sanctions evasion, including those doing business with China, and will continue to do so if necessary,"" he added. ""However, we have been approaching this diplomatically with the Chinese as part of our dialogue on Iran policy and think that, in general, this is a more effective path forward to address our concerns,"" the official said. Separately, a European official said this was one of the issues raised by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman when she visited China in late July. The European official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the nuclear diplomacy, said China has been protecting Iran and suggested one of the main issues for the West is how much oil China is buying from Iran. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the statements by the U.S. and European officials. Commodity analytics firm Kpler estimates that year-to-date Chinese oil imports from Iran have averaged 553,000 barrels per day through August. Indirect U.S.-Iranian talks about reviving the 2015 deal that began in April adjourned in June two days after hardliner Ebrahim Raisi was elected president of Iran, replacing Hassan Rouhani whose administration had negotiated the agreement. Under the deal, Iran agreed to place limits on its uranium enrichment program, which is one possible pathway to develop the fissile material for a nuclear weapon, in exchange for the easing of U.S., U.N. and European Union economic sanctions. Iran has denied seeking a nuclear bomb. In 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the agreement and reimposed harsh economic sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy, though Tehran has continued to make illicit oil sales to customers, including Chinese companies. After waiting for about a year, Iran responded to Trump's abrogation of the deal by starting to carry out some of the nuclear activities that it had agreed to curb under the pact, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Trump's successor President Joe Biden has said he was putting ""diplomacy first"" with Iran but if negotiations fail he would be prepared to turn to other unspecified options. A French presidency official told reporters on Tuesday that Iran must return to the Vienna talks on the United States and Iran resuming compliance with the deal in order to avoid a diplomatic escalation that could jeopardize the negotiations. ""We need, in this phase, to stay in close contact and closely united with all of the members of the JCPOA, including the Russians and the Chinese,"" the French official said. ""In particular, we expect the Chinese to express themselves and act in a more determined way. We need to exert pressure, which is indispensable, on Iran,"" the French official added. Iran's foreign minister said as recently as Friday that it will return to talks on resuming compliance with the nuclear deal ""very soon,"" but he gave no specific date. It is unclear how receptive China may be to any U.S. diplomatic overture on Iran. U.S.-Sino relations have sunk to their worst state in decades this year, with scant progress on issues ranging from human rights to transparency over the origins of COVID-19. In a Sept. 24 briefing, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson put the onus on the United States rather than on Iran.   ""As the one that started the new round of tensions in the Iranian nuclear situation, the US should redress its wrong policy of maximum pressure on Iran, lift all illegal sanctions on Iran and measures of long-arm jurisdiction on third parties, and work to resume negotiations and achieve outcomes at an early date,"" the spokesperson said according to a ministry transcript.

Tuesday's launch was of ""great strategic significance"", the official Korean Central News Agency said, as the North seeks to increase its defence capabilities a ""thousand-fold"". Hypersonic missiles move far faster and are more nimble than ordinary ones, making them much harder for missile defence systems -- on which the US is spending billions -- to intercept. The launch from Jagang province ""confirmed the navigational control and stability of the missile"", along with its ""guiding manoeuverability and the gliding flight characteristics of the detached hypersonic gliding warhead"" and the engine, according to KCNA. ""The test results proved that all the technical specifications met the design requirements"", it added. The South's military had announced the launch shortly after it happened on Tuesday, but it did not officially reveal the missile's maximum altitude and flight distance afterwards, information that it normally makes available within less than an hour. South Korean media reports cited unidentified sources saying the device showed ""different flight features"" from previous launches and President Moon Jae-in called for ""comprehensive analysis"" of the event. Both Koreas are building up their weapons capabilities in what could become an arms race on the divided peninsula. The nuclear-armed North, which invaded the South in 1950, is under multiple international sanctions over its banned nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, and earlier this month said it tested a long-range cruise missile. Seoul is also spending billions on military development and this month successfully test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) for the first time, making it one of a handful of nations with the advanced technology.   On Tuesday, it held a ceremony to launch its third SLBM submarine. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

The far-right leader, one of the leading international allies of Donald Trump, has warned that Brazil could see scenes reminiscent of the January 6 mob violence in Washington by supporters of the former US president's false claims of election fraud. In a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, four Democratic senators said that disruption in Brazil's democracy ""would jeopardize the very foundation"" of relations between the Western Hemisphere's two most populous nations. ""We urge you to make clear that the United States supports Brazil's democratic institutions, and that any undemocratic break with the current constitutional order will have serious consequences,"" said the senators including Dick Durbin, the chamber's number two Democrat, and Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The senators voiced alarm at Bolsonaro's claims without evidence that the voting system is mired in fraud and his suggestions that he would not concede defeat. ""This type of reckless language is dangerous for any democracy, but it is especially unmerited in a democracy of Brazil's caliber, which for decades has shown itself capable of facilitating peaceful transfers of power."" The Biden administration has been low-key in public statements on Bolsonaro, and Blinken met last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly with Brazilian Foreign Minister Carlos Franca. A State Department official said the meeting was largely to encourage the climate-skeptic Bolsonaro to raise ambitions ahead of a high-stakes UN climate conference in Glasgow in November, with Brazil a crucial player for the planet due to the Amazon's role as a carbon sink.   Bolsonaro, whose approval rating has tanked in part due to Brazil's severe Covid-19 outbreak, has said he will not stage a coup although some supporters have called on the military to intervene to keep him in power.

A third of the 89 places of worship ""suspected of being radical"" and flagged by the intelligence services had been checked since November 2020, he told Le Figaro newspaper. Of those, action to shut down six -- in five different departments across France -- had been launched, he said. The authorities would also request the dissolution of the Islamist publishers Nawa and the Black African Defence League (LDNA). Nawa, based in the southern French town of Ariege, ""incites the extermination of the Jews and legitimises the stoning of homosexuals"", Darmanin said. The LDNA, the organisers of a protest against police violence in front of the US embassy in Paris in June last year, ""calls for hate and discrimination"", he said. ""In the coming year, 10 other associations are going to be the object of a dissolution procedure, four them next month,"" he said. Last week, the Council of State, France's highest administrative court, approved the government's move to dissolve the Collective against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) and Baraka City. The government acted after the October 2020 murder of teacher Samuel Paty. Paty was targeted following an online campaign against him for having shown controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed published by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo during a civics class.   Darmanin also said he had called on regional prefects to refuse any residence permits to imam's sent by a foreign country.

The probe, called Lucy after an ancient fossil that provided insights into the evolution of human species, will launch on October 16 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Its mission is to investigate the group of rocky bodies circling the Sun in two swarms, one preceding Jupiter in its orbital path and the other trailing behind it. After receiving boosts from Earth's gravity, Lucy will embark on a 12-year journey to eight different asteroids - one in the Main Belt between Mars and Jupiter and then seven Trojans. ""Despite the fact that they really are in a very small region of space, they're very physically different from one another,"" Hal Levison, the mission's principal scientist told reporters, about the Trojan asteroids, which number more than 7,000 in total. ""For example, they have very different colors, some are grey, some are red,"" he added, with the differences indicating how far away from the Sun they might have formed before assuming their present trajectory. ""Whatever Lucy finds will give us vital clues about the formation of our solar system,"" added Lori Glaze, director of NASA's planetary science division. Lucy will fly by its target objects within 250 miles (400 kilometers) of their surfaces, and use its onboard instruments and large antenna to investigate their geology, including composition, mass, density and volume. The ship was built by Lockheed Martin and includes over two miles of wire and solar panels that, placed end-to-end, would be as tall as a five-story building. It will be the first solar-powered to venture this far from the Sun, and will observe more asteroids than any other spacecraft before it. The total mission cost is $981 million. The researchers who discovered Lucy the fossil in Ethiopia in 1974 named her after the Beatles' song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" which they were playing loudly at the expedition camp.   In a nod to this heritage, the official logo of the NASA mission is diamond shaped. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

French fisherman have become increasingly angry over how Britain has controlled access for EU boats into its waters after it exited the bloc. London says it has pursued a ""reasonable approach"", issuing nearly 1,700 licences to EU boats to fish in Britain's exclusive economic zone, which is defined as being 12-200 nautical miles from the coast. A total of 117 have been issued for the 6-12 mile zone. ""As regards the 6-12 mile zone..., EU vessels must provide evidence of a track record of fishing activity in those waters,"" the government said in a statement Tuesday. ""We have been considering applications for vessels of under 12 metres in length to fish in this zone and, on the basis of the evidence available, we are able to grant licences for 12 of the 47 applications made."" But French Maritime Minister Annick Girardin called it ""a new British refusal to apply the conditions of the Brexit accord"". Her only remaining priority was to get the licences for French fishermen, ""as provided for by the agreement"", she added. ""French fishing must not be held hostage by the British for political ends."" - Channel Islands dispute - Britain said the other applications had been rejected because of insufficient evidence the boats had fished in the area between 2012 and 2016, as stipulated in the post-Brexit agreement reached last year between London and Brussels. London insisted its ""approach has been reasonable and fully in line with our commitments in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA)"". The list of successful vessels is due to be published on Wednesday. France said 87 applications have been made, with the discrepancy revolving around licences for vessels that replaced older boats that had previously fished in the area. Britain and France are also at loggerheads over fishing rights in the British Channel islands of Jersey and Guernsey. In May, as tensions over access to the self-governing crown dependencies boiled over, French trawlers briefly encircled Jersey's main port. Tuesday's news comes 48 hours before dozens of French fishermen's licences were due to expire for fishing there. Jersey has offered to extend some of those licences on a provisional basis until the end of January 2022, while those concerned sort out the paperwork. Guernsey meanwhile has simply renewed licences on a month-to-month basis. Paris said it was waiting for definitive answers on 169 licence requests from the Jersey authorities, and 168 requests from Guernsey.   But there is increasing anger among French fishermen's groups, with some calling for retaliatory measures against British boats.

He listed, as examples, measures to fight climate change, further boost Canada's Covid vaccination rates -- already among the highest in the world -- and bolster Canada's economic recovery. He also said to expect a decision ""in the coming weeks"" on whether to ban Huawei equipment from Canada's 5G wireless networks, after the United States and other key allies did so.

General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Kenneth McKenzie, commander of US Central Command, said they had personally recommended that the United States maintain about 2,500 troops on the ground in Afghanistan. President Joe Biden, in April, ordered a complete pullout of forces from Afghanistan by September 11, following through on an agreement reached with the Taliban by former president Donald Trump to end the US troop presence there. Milley, McKenzie and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee to address the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Milley was asked whether the pullout and chaotic evacuation from Kabul had damaged US credibility. ""I think that our credibility with allies and partners around the world and with adversaries is being intensely reviewed by them to see which way this is going to go and I think 'damage' is one word that could be used, yes,"" he said. Milley said the Taliban ""was and remains a terrorist organization and they still have not broken ties with Al-Qaeda,"" which used Afghanistan as a base to plot the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. ""It remains to be seen whether or not the Taliban can consolidate power or if the country will fracture into further civil war,"" he said. ""But we must continue to protect the American people from terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan,"" Milley said. A reconstituted Al Qaeda or Islamic State with aspirations to attack America remains ""a very real possibility,"" he added, but ""it's too early to determine their capability."" - 'Took us all by surprise' - Austin said the United States ""did not fully comprehend the depth of corruption and poor leadership"" in the Afghan armed forces. ""We helped build a state, but we could not forge a nation,"" he said. ""The fact that the Afghan army we and our partners trained simply melted away -- in many cases without firing a shot -- took us all by surprise,"" the Pentagon chief said. ""It would be dishonest to claim otherwise."" Austin said the United States had provided the Afghan military ""with equipment and aircraft and the skills to use them"" but ""in the end, we couldn't provide them with the will to win."" - 'Deescalate' - Milley also testified about calls he made to his Chinese counterpart in the waning months of the Trump presidency. He said they were intended to ""deescalate"" tensions and the former president had no aim of attacking China. ""I know, I am certain, President Trump did not intend to attack the Chinese,"" Milley said. ""My task at that time was to deescalate. My message again was consistent: stay calm and steady and deescalate. We are not going to attack you,"" he said. The calls between Milley and his Chinese counterpart, General Li Zuocheng, were first revealed in the book ""Peril"" by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. The first call was on October 30, four days before the US presidential election, and the second was on January 8, two days after supporters of Trump stormed the US Capitol in an effort to prevent certification of Biden's victory. Some Republican lawmakers have accused Milley of overstepping his authority and called for him to resign. Milley defended his actions and said the calls were coordinated with the then-secretaries of defense. ""The specific purpose of the October and January calls was generated by concerning intelligence which caused us to believe the Chinese were worried about an attack by the US,"" Milley said. ""These military-to-military communications at the highest levels are critical to the security of the United States in order to deconflict military actions, manage crisis, and prevent war between great powers armed with nuclear weapons,"" he said. ""At no time was I attempting to change or influence the process, usurp authority, or insert myself into the chain of command,"" Milley added.   ""I firmly believe in civilian control of the military as a bedrock principle essential to this Republic and I am committed to ensuring the military stays clear of domestic politics.""

A Bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar, was informed by the DCW that it will ensure holistic rehabilitation and legal support to a 19-year-old woman who was allegedly sexually assaulted by her father when she was a minor. The DCW said rehabilitation provided by them to such survivors includes providing financial help, access to education, skill development and facilitating job opportunities. The top court today said that the first issue is of providing immediate comfort and security to the woman. Noting that the DCW is willing to provide help to the woman, the top court then asked the counsel appearing for the petitioner to interact with the officials of the DCW in this regard and tell all things so that they can take appropriate steps. The Bench was told by the petitioner's counsel that the accused father has not been arrested yet and he is sending threatening messages and calls to the woman. The Bench asked them to meet the DCW officials and said it would hear the matter on Wednesday. The top court was hearing the plea of the woman seeking direction to transfer the case registered on her complaint from Ambala to Delhi. The petition, drawn by advocate Akshita Goyal, has claimed that her father had sexually assaulted her when she was a minor. It said that as her mother had passed away in 2016, there is no one to look after her in the family. She also sought direction to the DCW to look after the protection and basic necessities of her as she fears for her safety. On September 24, the top court had asked the DCW to inform it about steps it would take to provide relief to the woman. It had also asked the Delhi Police to apprise it whether it has any objection in taking over the investigation in the case. Filing its affidavit, the DCW said the woman had approached it on July 23 with a complaint of alleged sexual assault by her father which took place when she was a minor and a senior member of the commission interacted with her and held detailed counselling. It has contacted the woman for a detailed interaction so that a plan can be chalked out for her rehabilitation as per her aspirations. The DCW further stated that based on the interest of the woman, the commission can facilitate to place her in a shelter home and arrange for her further education and enrol her in probable skill development courses so that she can become self-independent and lead a normal life. As per the petition, the woman had left her home on July 22 and went to one of her relative's house and the next day, she had approached the DCW. The plea said the woman had ""escaped the clutches of her father"" and mustered the courage to inform about her ordeal and sexual exploitation to the DCW and Delhi Police in July this year.   In the case, a zero FIR was lodged at Delhi in July and was subsequently transferred to Ambala. A zero FIR can be filed in any police station and it is then forwarded to the concerned police station under whose jurisdiction the alleged offence has been committed for necessary action.

Mr Sidhu's resignation came just before former Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh's visit to the national capital, who was visiting Delhi after he resigned on September 18. The tussle in Punjab Congress escalated after the party's central leadership sought to bury the hatchet by appointing Navjot Singh Sidhu as the Congress chief apparently against the desire of the Chief Minister."

At the launch event held at Chhatrasal Stadium on the birth anniversary of revolutionary freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, the chief minister remarked that nowadays people feel patriotic only while raising the Tricolour or singing the national anthem. But patriotism has to be a continually evolving feeling within everyone, he said. ""In the last 74 years, we taught physics, chemistry and maths in our schools but did not teach ''deshbhakti'' to the children. Patriotism is within all of us but it needs a push. Every child in Delhi will be a patriot in the truest sense. The ''Deshbhakti Curriculum'' will prove to be instrumental in the country's development and will take India forward rapidly."" ""Today we only feel patriotic while raising the Tricolour or singing the national anthem. The problem is it only props up when we do something of this sort,"" Mr Kejriwal said. Raising the slogans ''Bharat Mata ki Jai'', ''Inquilab Zindabad'' and ''Vande Matram'', the chief minister said, ""We need to develop an environment wherein we all and our children constantly feel patriotic at every step we take. Patriotism has to be a continually evolving feeling within all of us."" Mr Kejriwal said all kinds of professionals are coming up ''deshbhakt professionals'' are not being developed. ""It doesn't mean we won't promote professions. We will continue to support all kinds of education but we will add a touch of patriotic values to them. We will develop ''deshbhakt'' doctors, lawyers, engineers, actors, singers, artists, journalists and so on. ""A ''deshbhakt'' doctor would look to help maximum people and not just collect the highest fees. ''Deshbhakt'' professionals would return from work thinking how they can further contribute to society and not how to rake in more money from under the table. A patriotic officer won't think about bribes but about clearing the most number of files to help the people,"" he said. The ''Deshbhakti Curriculum'' will be rolled out from nursery to Class 12 as and when schools reopen for the respective grades. The curriculum won't have any textbooks. Facilitator's handbooks have been designed for three cohorts -- nursery to class five; classes six to eight and classes nine to 12 -- and these will be used to inculcate patriotism among the students through simple activities. The facilitator's handbooks for two cohorts -- classes 6 to 8 and 9-12 -- and 100 stories of freedom fighters and patriots were also unveiled at the launch event. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said, ""We talk about Bhagat Singh, Hemu Kalani, Jhansi Ki Rani and Tantia Tope's battles but we never discuss what led them onto the battles, how they fought those battles."" The ''Deshbhakti Curriculum'' will bridge this knowledge gap, he said, while underlining that the students will not be asked to memorise historical facts and the curriculum will not preach moral values. ""It will not just talk about patriotism, but inculcate a passion for it. It will not preach moral values. We will not expect students to memorise historical facts, but will expect them to retrospect about their patriotism,"" Mr Sisodia said. Knowing that Bhagat Singh sacrificed his life at 23 years and comparing themselves at that age, students will introspect about that level of commitment, passion, and embody it, he said. ""We should learn how Babasaheb (Ambedkar) surpassed the definitions of political independence and vowed for social and mental independence and how he laid a strong constitution for us."" ""We will teach the children the importance of this struggle and make sure they realize what it was like to experience such disparities. We will include 100 stories every year in this curriculum,"" he said. According to officials, the topics include taking responsibility towards the country and its progress, constructive criticism, respect for and harmonious coexistence with others, critically thinking about issues confronting the country, comprehensive conception of patriotism, linking patriotism to the lived realities and everyday actions of students and working for the country's development with pride and honesty. Some of the chapters are: ''My India is glorious but why not developed'', ''Deshbhakti: My country my pride'', ''Who is a Deshbhakt'' and ''India of my dreams."" The teaching method would be activities-based such as maintaining a ''Deshbhakti diary'', participating in ''Deshbhakti dhyan'', ''Flag day'' activity and group discussion, among others. Mr Sisodia said that every class would begin with a ''Deshbhakti Dhyan'' of five minutes where students will talk about five new patriots each day. ""Since this is the first year (of the curriculum) and we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of Independence, we are including 100 patriots.""   ""Next year onwards, we will include 100 more and then another hundred after that. This would go on and on. Right from nursery to class 12, a child will be able to witness at least 700-800 stories and 500-600 patriotic songs and poems,"" he said. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced the plan for Deshbhakti Curriculum on the 73rd Independence Day celebrations in 2019. The curriculum has been prepared by the Delhi Government school teachers, with inputs from NGO partners and experts."

Speaking at the high-level plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly to commemorate the ‘International Day for The Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons', Mr Shringla expressed confidence that the meeting will provide further impetus to global collective efforts through a synthesis of various proposals and ideas. ""India believes that the goal of nuclear disarmament can be achieved through a step by step process underwritten by universal commitment and an agreed, multilateral framework that is global and non-discriminatory,” he said. He highlighted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has indicated India's openness to new ideas as manifest in the ancient text of the Rig Veda, as he quoted that, 'Let noble thoughts come to us from all sides'. “It is in this spirit of openness that India will engage with all Member States towards realising a nuclear weapons-free world,” Mr Shringla said. He voiced India's commitment to the goal of universal, non-discriminatory, and verifiable nuclear disarmament, leading to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, consistent with the highest priority accorded to nuclear disarmament by the Final Document of the First Special Session of the UN General Assembly on Disarmament (SSOD-1). ""India, as a responsible nuclear weapon State, has a nuclear doctrine outlining credible minimum deterrence with the posture of no-first-use and non-use against non-nuclear-weapon States,” he said. India's approach is outlined in its Working Paper submitted to the UNGA First Committee in 2006 and to the Conference on Disarmament in 2007, which has an “enduring relevance”, Mr Shringla said. He pointed out that as the world's sole multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, the Conference on Disarmament is “well placed” to commence negotiations on a Comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Convention. ""Without diminishing the priority we attach to disarmament, India has supported the immediate commencement of negotiations in the CD on a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT) on the basis of CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein, which remains the most suitable basis for negotiations,” he said. As per the CD/1299, the Conference on Disarmament decides to establish an ad hoc committee on a ""ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices”. The Conference directs the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.   Mr Shringla said India's annual resolution in the UN General Assembly on the ‘Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons' tabled since 1982 enjoys wide support of the membership and calls on the Conference on Disarmament to commence negotiations in order to reach an agreement on an international convention prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances.

The company said it would focus instead on another type of jab it is developing with British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline and which is in the final phase of human trials. Sanofi's mRNA vaccine -- the ground-breaking technology used by rivals Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna -- had positive results in phase one and two of clinical trials, the firm said. But Sanofi said it will not take it into the third and final phase, arguing that it would arrive too late to market with 12 billion Covid doses due to be produced by the end of the year. Instead, the company will use the mRNA technology for vaccines against other pathogens, including the flu. ""The need is not to create new Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, but to equip France and Europe with an arsenal of messenger RNA vaccines for the next pandemic, for new pathologies,"" Sanofi's vice-president for vaccines, Thomas Triomphe, told AFP. ""There is no public health need for another messenger RNA vaccine"" against Covid-19, he added. Results from phase three trials of the other vaccine developed with GlaxoSmithKline are expected before the end of 2021. The firms are combining a Sanofi-developed antigen, which stimulates the production of germ-killing antibodies, with GSK's adjuvant technology, a substance that bolsters the immune response triggered by a vaccine. Fighting flu and malaria Messenger RNA works by providing human cells with the genetic instructions to make a surface protein of the coronavirus, which trains the immune system to recognise the real virus. Sanofi said initial results for the mRNA product showed antibodies were created by 91-100 percent of test participants two weeks after a second injection. No side effects were observed and tolerance of the jab was comparable to other mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. The immune response from the Sanofi mRNA vaccine ""is strong"", Triomphe said. Sanofi had been working since March 2020 with Translate Bio, a US firm specialising in mRNA technology, and had even bought the biotech company for 2.7 billions euros ($3.2 billion) at the start of August. Sanofi has already launched new tests for a seasonal flu vaccine and intends to start clinical trials next year. The results from the Covid mRNA vaccine ""will clearly help inform the path forward for our mRNA development programs,"" said Sanofi's global head of research and development, Jean-Francois Toussaint. ""Today, we have a promising mRNA platform, which we're taking to the next level in development, including moving to modified mRNA, and against other diseases, including flu.""   Germany's BioNTech, which developed its coronavirus mRNA vaccine with US giant Pfizer, announced in July that it aimed to start trialling a malaria vaccine using mRNA technology.

US officials have identified Pakistan as a base of operations or target for numerous armed and non-state terrorist groups, some of which have existed since the 1980s, the independent Congressional Research Service (CRS) said in the report. The report, 'Terrorist and Other Militant Groups in Pakistan', released by the bipartisan research wing of US Congress on the eve of the historic Quad summit hosted by US President Joe Biden at the White House last week, said that these groups operating in Pakistan can be broadly categorised into five types -- globally-oriented, Afghanistan oriented, India- and Kashmir-oriented, domestically oriented, and Sectarian (anti-Shia). The Lashkar-e-Taiba (LET) was formed in the late 1980s in Pakistan and designated as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) in 2001. “LET was responsible for major 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India, as well as numerous other high-profile attacks,” the CRS said. Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) was founded in 2000 by Kashmiri terrorist leader Masood Azhar and was designated as an FTO in 2001. Along with LET, it was responsible for the 2001 attack on the Indian parliament, among other attacks, it said. JEM also has openly declared war on the United States, it noted. Harakat-ul Jihad Islami (HUJI) was formed in 1980 in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet army and was designated as an FTO in 2010. After 1989, it redirected its efforts toward India, although it did supply fighters to the Afghan Taliban. “With an unknown strength, HUJI today operates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India, and seeks annexation of Kashmir into Pakistan,” the report said, adding that HUM was designated as an FTO in 1997 and operates mainly from Pak-Occupied Kashmir and from some Pakistani cities. Finally, Hizb-ul Mujahideen (HM) was formed in 1989— reportedly as the terrorist wing of Pakistan's largest Islamist political party—and designated as an FTO in 2017. It is one of the largest and oldest terrorist groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir. Among other terrorist groups operating from Pakistan are Al Qaeda, CRS said, adding that it has operated primarily from the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas and in the megacity of Karachi, as well as in Afghanistan. It has since 2011 been led by Ayman al-Zawahiri and reportedly maintains supportive ties with many of the groups inside the country. CRS said according to the US State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2019, Pakistan has “continued to serve as a safe haven for certain regionally focused terrorist groups,” and has “allowed groups targeting Afghanistan ... as well as groups targeting India ...to operate from its territory”. Pakistan's neighbours, including Afghanistan and India, and the US have long accused Islamabad of providing safe haven and support to terrorists. The US State Department also noted “modest steps” taken by Pakistan's government to counter terrorism financing and to “restrain” some India-focused terrorist groups following an early 2019 terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir. It assessed, however, that “Islamabad has yet to take decisive actions against India- and Afghanistan-focused terrorists,” and that “progress on the most difficult aspects of its 2015 National Action Plan to counter terrorism remains unfulfilled—specifically its pledge to dismantle all terrorist organisations without delay and discrimination”.   On the topic of “terrorist safe havens,” the Department concluded that Pakistan's government and military “acted inconsistently with respect to terrorist safe havens throughout the country. Authorities did not take sufficient action to stop certain terrorist groups and individuals from openly operating in the country”. Other terrorist groups inside Pakistan are Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent(AQIS), Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP or IS-K); the Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), Jundallah (aka Jaysh al-Adl), Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LEJ)."

He inducted at the All India Congress Committee headquarters in New Delhi in the presence of party leader Rahul Gandhi. At the event, Gujarat Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani, too, extended his support to the outfit, though he couldn't join the party formally due to technical reasons. ""I am joining the Congress because it's not just a party, it's an idea. It's the country's oldest and most democratic party, and I am emphasising on 'democratic'...Not just me, but many think the country can't survive without Congress,"" Mr Kumar said at a press meet after joining Congress. ""Congress party is like a big ship. If it's saved, I believe many people's aspirations, Mahatma Gandhi's oneness, Bhagat Singh's courage, and BR Ambedkar's idea of equality will be protected, too. This is why I have joined it."" He felt that a particular ideology was trying to ruin India's values, culture, history, and future. He also claimed that ""crores of youngsters"" feel that the country ""can't be saved without saving the Congress"". Mr Kumar was earlier with the Communist Party of India (CPI) which he joined ahead of the 2019 general election. He then contested from his hometown Begusarai in Bihar against the BJP's Giriraj Singh of the BJP but failed to win. Posters welcoming him to the party were put up outside the Congress office hours ahead of his switch. He reportedly met Mr Gandhi twice recently over two weeks. He also met Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. A former president of the JNU Students' Union, Mr Kumar was jailed over alleged ""anti-national slogans"" raised at an event in 2016 to mark the death anniversary of Parliament attack mastermind Afzal Guru. The BJP, however, brushed aside the significance of Kanhaiya's move. Saying that Begusarai had rejected him, Bihar Minister Mangal Pandey told ANI that Mr Kumar was only demonstrating his ""political ambition"". ""Begusarai rejected Kanhiya Kumar's ideology earlier. Now he's changing his ideology and party for political ambition but public doesn't vote for anyone's political ambition. He's going to a party that has been rejected by Bihar and is a sinking boat now,"" Mr Pandey told ANI. Mr Mevani, on the other hand, is a legislator representing Gujarat's Vadgam constituency. He is key to the Congress's poll arithmetic ahead of next year's Assembly election in that state. A lawyer and former journalist, the Dalit leader's expression of support for the Congress comes at a time when the party is reaching out to the community -- it recently replaced Amarinder Singh as Punjab Chief Minister with Charanjit Singh Channi, a member of a Scheduled Caste. ""I could not join the Congress formally due to technical reasons. I am an independent MLA, if I join a party, I may not continue as an MLA...I am part of the Congress ideologically but I will fight the upcoming Gujarat polls from Congress symbol,"" Mr Mewani said. ""To save democracy and the idea of India, I have to be with a party that led the Independence struggle and dragged the British out of the country. This is why I am here with the Congress today."" Welcoming Mr Kumar, Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal said his party was looking forward to working with him and Mr Mevani to defeat ""fascist forces"" ruling this country. ""Kanhaiya Kumar is a symbol of the fight for freedom of expression in this country. He fought against fundamentalism as a student leader. The joining of kind of dynamic personality will fill the entire cadre of Congress with enthusiasm,"" Mr Venugopal said.   The moves by Mr Kumar and Mr Mevani have come at a time when some prominent leaders have left the Congress in recent months. While former Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev joined the Trinamool Congress, former Union Minister Jitin Prasada is now with the BJP. Veteran Goa Congress leader Luizinho Faleiro resigned from the party yesterday."

https://t.co/xTHsXfbFmy https://t.co/2FycPwNzq3",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/explained-what-is-dengue-type-2-virus-why-is-it-a-serious-challenge-2556441,DENV2 Explained: What You Should Know About Dangerous Dengue Strain,"A potent dengue virus is sweeping parts of the country as the monsoon season is coming to an end. Earlier this month, the central government asked 11 states reporting DENV-2 virus infections to ensure early detection of cases and prevent further spread of this virus. States have been asked to start helplines to educate people and stock an adequate number of testing kits and medicines. As people are still recovering from the trauma of COVID-19, this new viral spread could pose a serious health challenge for authorities in the upcoming festival season. Health experts fear the combined impact of these two diseases can result in devastating consequences. What Is DENV-2? Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection and the virus that causes the disease is called the dengue virus (DENV). Female mosquitoes mainly of the species Aedesaegypti and, to a lesser extent, Ae. Albopictus, transmit the virus. These mosquitoes also carry chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika viruses. There are four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4), meaning that it is possible to be infected four times. While most infections produce only mild illness, dengue virus can cause an acute flu-like illness. Sometimes this develops into severe dengue, which is blamed on the DENV-2 type. The DENV-2 type is considered the most severe. In addition to fever, it can cause two or more other symptoms of typical dengue infection and can be fatal.  Symptoms     The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme lists the symptoms for two categories of dengue infection: dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. They are listed below:  For dengue fever:  For hemorrhagic fever: Apart from symptoms similar to dengue fever, this infection may accompany severe and continuous stomach pain, cause skin to turn pale, cold, or clammy. There could be bleeding from the nose, frequent vomiting, and the mouth could become dry and the patient may feel thirsty and experience difficulty in breathing.         World Health Organization (WHO) says dengue-produced flu-like symptoms can last for 2-7 days and the incubation period can be 4-10 days. Which States Are Reporting DENV-2? Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh (Firozabad is one of the worst-hit places), Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana are reporting DENV-2, according to the Ministry of Health and FamilyWelfare.         Diagnosis Several methods can be used to diagnose DENV infection such as virological tests and serological tests. Patient samples collected during the first week of illness should be tested by both serological and virological methods (RT-PCR). Treatment No specific treatment has been found for dengue fever so far. Pills to reduce fever and painkillers can be taken to control the symptoms. Patients should immediately consult a physician. They should maintain a healthy ratio of body fluid volume for severe dengue care, according to WHO. Global Burden   According to WHO, 390 million people get infected with dengue every year. And 3.9 billion people are at risk of infection with dengue viruses. Though the risk of infection exists in 19 countries, 70 percent of the actual burden is reported from Asia. Over the last two decades, the number of dengue cases reported to WHO jumped 8 fold – from 505,430 cases in 2000 to over 2.4 million in2010, and 5.2 million in 2019. Reported deaths increased from 960 in the year 2000 to 4,032 in 2015."

Sunil Jakhar, who was Punjab Congress chief before Mr Sidhu, indicted his colleague of nothing short of outright betrayal by quitting from the post despite the leadership deciding to trust him at a chaotic time for the party's Punjab unit. ""It's just not cricket! What stands compromised in this entire 'episode' is the faith reposed in the (outgoing?) PCC President by the Congress leadership. No amount of grandstanding can justify this breach of trust placing his benefactors in a peculiar predicament,"" Mr Jakhar tweeted, referring to Pradesh Congress Committee or PCC, a formal term the party uses for its state units. Mr Sidhu was among the country's celebrated cricketers before he announced his retirement in 1999. A match fixing scandal in 2000 involving former cricketer Mohammed Azharuddin had put a stain on a generation of cricketers to which Mr Sidhu belonged. Mr Sidhu has often said match-fixing is a treason and fixers should be punished harshly. The allusion to cricket in the tweet by Mr Jakhar was seen as a swipe at the controversies that brushed past Mr Sidhu, who later joined politics in 2004, when he contested the Lok Sabha election on a BJP ticket and won from Amritsar. Mr Sidhu's rival and chief critic Captain Amarinder Singh made an even stronger criticism of his younger colleague on Tuesday. ""I told you so... he is not a stable man and not fit for the border state of Punjab,"" tweeted Mr Singh, whose exit as Chief Minister was ascribed to Mr Sidhu. Mr Sidhu joined Congress ahead of the assembly election in Punjab in 2017. The Congress won the state election then and Mr Singh became the Chief Minister, while Mr Sidhu was made Punjab's Tourism and Local Bodies Minister. In 2019, Mr Sidhu accused Mr Singh of singling him out for the Congress's poor performance in the Lok Sabha election. Though the Congress won eight out of 13 parliamentary seats in Punjab, it won only 52 overall. Mr Singh hit back at his younger colleague, saying he wanted to replace him as Chief Minister.   In July this year, after much war of words between Mr Sidhu and Mr Singh, the Congress appointed the former cricketer as Punjab Congress chief. Two months later, Mr Singh resigned as Chief Minister and Charanjit Singh Channi took over the top post. Mr Sidhu's missed opportunity of becoming Chief Minister, something that he was seen to be angling for since 2017 when he joined Congress, could be a factor for his resentment, political analysts say."

Speaking at the UN's high-level discussion on jobs and social protection for poverty eradication, Ms Sitharaman also said that the UN's proposed accelerated action on jobs and social protection should have digitalisation at the core of the design. She further said that insights from behavioural economics can be leveraged in onboarding those workers who are currently not covered under the formal security net. ""One key principle underpinning the post-pandemic recovery with policies integrating health and social protection is the institutional recognition of mental wellbeing of vulnerable sections through psychosocial support. Future policies must adequately provide for this imperative,"" she said in her virtual address. She listed out measures taken by the Indian government to ameliorate immediate distress, and provide necessary protection to the vulnerable section of the population and said that India's free vaccination programme is globally one of the biggest and the country has covered 875 billion vaccine doses as of today. ""India launched a comprehensive economic package under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat to combat the impact of the pandemic and to revive economic growth. The financial package of USD 366 billion amounting to more than 13 per cent of India's GDP was deployed to create employment opportunities for the unorganised sector, strengthening MSMEs and for promoting rural economy,"" she said. To mitigate the impact of the crisis, over 4 million migrant workers were given assistance, while construction workers were given in situ support to sail through the trying times, she said. More than 100 million rural and unorganised workers received wages amounting to more than ₹ 1 trillion, she said. ""The comprehensive social protection system envisaged to be created under the proposed global accelerator for jobs and social protection should have digitalisation of public financial management systems at the core of the design. In India, the DBT method enabled Jandhan, the Aadhar biometric identification and mobile trinity helped during the pandemic in rolling out social protection measures without any delays,"" Ms Sitharaman added.

In an interaction with students of the IIT, Mr Naidu also stressed on the need for value-based politics while citing declining standards in Parliament and state legislatures. The youth should join politics but not ""politricks"", Mr Naidu said. Join party of your choice, work as a team, inculcate a spirit of competitiveness and do value-based politics, he said. ""We see people frequently changing parties like children change their clothes. Nothing wrong in changing parties but you should not change the parties for the sake of power. This is what is happening and this is a matter of concern,"" he said. For politics, 4Cs--character, capacity, conduct and caliber-are required, he said. Unfortunately, in our political system, some people have replaced these 4Cs with cast, community cash and criminality, he said. He called upon the youth to select a candidate on his character, caliber, capability and conduct and not simply because he belongs to a certain community. ""No leader can serve one community. There are so many communities and you should aspire to become a leader of the people not a community,"" he said. Describing nationalism, the Vice-President said it is not a mere slogan. We must develop a national outlook, which means people's welfare irrespective of caste, creed, sex and religion, he said. Later in the day, Mr Naidu laid the foundation stone of an ""artificial intelligence of things laboratory"" at the IIT and also inaugurated the Jodhpur City Knowledge and Innovation Cluster (JCKIC) there. ""The objective of science and technology is to improve the lifestyle of people and this should also be the sole objective of the AI,"" he said. Terming the AI as the most important necessity of future, Naidu said such transitional technologies should be employed in public welfare and improving the life of the common man. While talking about the JCKIC, he said educational institutions should become centres for innovation and called upon the IIT administration to share their experiences and best practices with other institutions. Earlier in the day, Mr Naidu unveiled Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra's book ""Sanvidhan, Sanskriti aur Rashtra"". Mr Naidu called upon everyone to abide by the Constitution and create awareness among the masses about it, according to a release. Terming the Constitution supreme, the vice-president said it gives the people rights and also teaches about duty.   He described the Constitution as sacred as the scriptures and stressed upon all to be loyal to it. He said the Indian culture is diverse with no distinction based on caste, creed, language and religion."

The hardliners have increasingly excluded women from public life since sweeping to power in mid-August, pushing many female entrepreneurs to flee the country or go into hiding. Many fear a return to their brutally oppressive rule from 1996 to 2001 when women were effectively banned from going to school or work, and only allowed to leave the house with a male relative. ""We will raise our voice so that it reaches their ears,"" said Shafiqeh Attai, who started her saffron company in the western city of Herat in 2007. ""No matter what happens we won't just sit at home, because we have worked very hard."" 'We will not remain silent' Attai's business, the Pashton Zarghon Saffron Women's Company, produces, processes, packages and exports the world's most expensive spice with an almost exclusively female workforce. More than 1,000 women pick the brightly coloured crocuses across the company's 25 hectares (60 acres) of land in the Pashton Zarghon district of Herat Province, which borders Iran. Another 55 hectares are independently owned and operate under the collective that Attai set up for women saffron pickers, who are represented by union leaders. Employing women allows them to be breadwinners for their families, Attai said, enabling them to send their children to school, and to buy them clothing and other essentials. ""I worked hard to establish my business,"" the 40-year-old said. ""We don't want to sit quietly and be ignored. Even if they ignore us, we will not remain silent."" Alternative to opium The ousted, Western-backed government encouraged farmers to grow the spice -- used in dishes from biryani to paella -- in a bid to wean them away from Afghanistan's huge and problematic poppy industry. Still, the country remains by far the world's biggest producer of opium and heroin, supplying between 80 and 90 per cent of global output. During their previous stint in power, the Taliban -- who used the sale of opium to fund their insurgency -- destroyed much of the crop ostensibly to eradicate it, though critics said it was to drive up the value of their huge stockpiles. The cultivation of poppies has again surged in recent years, as poverty and instability increased. Afghanistan's production area is now roughly four times larger now than in 2002, according to the United Nations. 'Red gold' Herat Province produces the vast majority of Afghanistan's saffron. At more than $5,000 per kilogram (2.2 pounds), saffron is the world's most expensive spice, and Attai's company produces between 200 and 500 kilos each year. The pistil of the flower has for centuries been used around the world in cooking, perfumes, medicines, tea and even as an aphrodisiac -- and because of its high price has been dubbed ""red gold"" by those who rely on its cultivation. Best grown in the baking hot sun, the bright purple saffron flowers are harvested in October and November by armies of workers, many of them women in their fifties and sixties, who start picking at dawn before the plants wilt later in the day. Labourers then prise apart the delicate lilac leaves, vivid red stigmas and pale yellow stamens -- painstaking work that demands concentration and skill. 'Hard work' Attai is concerned not just about the future of her business, but also for women across Afghanistan who are living in limbo, uncertain about jobs, education and representation in government. ""Now that the government of the Islamic Emirate is here we are very worried that they will block our work,"" she said. ""They haven't given girls the permission to go back to school and university, and they haven't given any women posts in the government -- I am worried about what will happen,"" she added. ""I'm not just thinking about myself, I'm thinking about all those that this business supports to run their homes,"" she said, noting that some of her employees are the sole breadwinners in their families. ""I am worried that 20 years of hard work by these women will go to waste."" 'Cannot be ignored' In the 20 years between the US-led ouster of the Taliban in 2001 and the Islamists' return, many women became business leaders, particularly in cities like Herat. Long a key commercial hub near Iran and Turkmenistan's borders, the city has in recent months suffered from the flight of many businesswomen. Younes Qazizadeh, head of the city's chamber of commerce, told AFP that he hoped the Taliban would make an official announcement to indicate that ""women could come back and do business under this government as well"". For now, the fate of businesses like Attai's hangs on a thread. ""It is our hope to start women's businesses again in our country,"" Qazizadeh added. Attai said that for now, she is staying in her homeland because she has ""some hope"" that her business can survive. Ahead of the US pullout, a mammoth airlift saw 124,000 people evacuated from Kabul airport. ""I could have left as well. But I didn't leave because all the hard work and effort that we put in should not be ignored,"" Attai said. ""I don't think they will block our work,"" she added, referring to the Taliban. ""We are a company which is completely run by women and employs women -- not a single man is brave enough to stop that. A woman who has shovelled her fields day and night cannot be ignored.""

Dubbing Congress leader Amarinder Singh's allegation that Mr Sidhu may move to another party speculation, the cricketer-turned-politician's advisor Surinder Dalla told NDTV that the former Chief Minister ""must have been confused"" while making the comment. ""Mr Sidhu's fight is one of principles,"" Mr Dalla said. ""People should understand that for any political party or elected representative, the prime issue is the issue of one's own state."" When asked if Mr Sidhu had opposed legislator SS Randhawa being made a minister in Punjab, Mr Dalla said, ""The issue was not about 'which individual must get which ministry'. The principle in question was whether there was any forward movement, from day one, on the 18 points that had been agreed upon?"" He insisted that the state Congress President had no personal issues with Captain Amarinder Singh, who quit a few days ago as Chief Minister after battling severe inner-party criticism for months. When a few issues - like the one involving sacrilege or certain government appointments - that had rankled Mr Sidhu during Mr Singh's term were listed out, Mr Dalla said the question was whether the new government was setting up a team that would handle them. ""The party and the government should have followed the same line. If Captain Saab himself had followed that line, then what was the problem?"" Mr Dalla said. ""If even after the change (in leadership), the new government doesn't follow that line from day one, then 'people' are bound to get angry, and it did happen."" Will a situation arise now where Mr Sidhu withdraws his resignation?   ""I am not in a position to say anything on this matter right now. If we don't work on the party's line, then what will the state party's chief tell the people?"" ""It is my opinion that before any decision is taken, the people's sentiments need to be considered."""

The 345-page charge sheet was filed before the sessions court in Dindoshi. The woman was allegedly raped and assaulted inside a stationary vehicle on September 10 by a 45-year-old man. She died at the civic-run Rajawadi Hospital the next day due to heavy blood loss. The incident, which brought back the memories of the 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder, caused a huge outrage. The Opposition had accused the Shiv Sena-led state government of failing to protect the women in the state, triggering a letter war between Governor BS Koshyari and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. In the wake of the incident, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to complete the probe in one month.   An FIR was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against the arrested accused.

Social media users alleged the videos were filmed in UP's Kanpur town. Mr Iftikharuddin is a 1985 batch officer who was posted in Kanpur between 2007 and 2018 in various positions. He is now in Lucknow as chief of the state's Road Transport Corporation and has said he has been ""misinterpreted"". The videos in question were shared among others by the verified Twitter account of Neeraj Jain, who is the Deputy Mayor of the municipal corporation in Rajasthan's Ajmer.

The same video was also shared by the Twitter account of Sudharshan News, which , in the past, has been accused of peddling hate via TV and social media.

The videos shared on social media appear to show Mr Iftikharuddin seated on a chair in a room with 10-15 other people, all of whom are sitting on the ground.

Two other videos show other men taking to the same group while Mr Iftikharuddin remains seated in his chair.

""The February 2020 riots were a conspiracy, planned and executed. They evidently did not take place in a spur of the moment,"" the Delhi High Court said in strong remarks on the three-day violence that left over 50 dead and 200 injured. The court said in the video footage submitted by the prosecution, it was clear from the conduct of the protesters that the riots were a planned attempt to disrupt normal life and the functioning of the government. ""The systematic disconnection and destruction of the CCTV cameras also confirms the existence of a pre-planned and pre-meditated conspiracy to disturb law and order in the city,"" said Justice Subramonium Prasad. ""This is also evident from the fact that innumerable rioters ruthlessly descended with sticks, dandas, bats etc. upon a hopelessly outnumbered cohort of police officials."" Justice Prasad made the comments while denying the bail request of an accused, Mohammad Ibrahim, who was arrested in December. Another accused, Mohammad Saleem Khan, was granted bail. ""Individual liberty"" cannot be used to threaten the fabric of civilised society, the High Court said, adding that Ibrahim was seen on CCTV clips threatening the crowds with a sword. Ibrahim has been linked to the killing of Head Constable Ratan Lal on February 24 by a mob of protesters. His lawyer had argued that Ratan Lal's death was not caused by a sword. Ibrahim also claimed that he was carrying the sword only to protect himself and his family.   The court rejected his arguments, saying the ""clinching evidence that tilts the court towards extending Ibrahim's custody"" is the weapon he was carrying, which could have inflicted serious injuries and even killed. The case involves a mob attack on policemen at Chand Bagh in northeast Delhi at the peak of the riots revolving around protests over a new citizenship law. Ratan Lal, who was a part of the grossly outnumbered contingent of policemen, died of head injuries and another official was severely injured."

The cricketer-turned-politician tweeted a resignation letter that hinted at his unhappiness at the ongoing changes to the Punjab cabinet.    ""The collapse of a man's character stems from the compromise corner. I can never compromise on Punjab's future and the agenda for the welfare of Punjab. Therefore, I hereby resign as the President of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. I will continue to serve the Congress,"" Navjot Sidhu, 57, wrote in his letter to Sonia Gandhi, which he posted on social media. He had taken charge of the party in Punjab in July. Sources say Mr Sidhu was upset about the cabinet changes made by new Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who was seen to be close to him. Though Mr Sidhu was widely seen to act as ""Super Chief Minister"" when it came to some decisions, he was reportedly ignored in recent appointments seen as controversial. He was also angry about key posts given to officials linked to the ""sacrilege"" case. Navjot Sidhu, say sources, was also unhappy about his rival SS Randhawa being assigned a key ministry. The double use of the word ""compromise"" in Mr Sidhu's resignation letter was read as a clue that he was asked to accept some unpleasant choices in the cabinet shuffle. Amarinder Singh, recently replaced as Chief Minister at Navjot Sidhu's instance, did not lose time in posting an ""I-told-you-so"" for the Congress leadership. ""I told you so...he is not a stable man and not fit for the border state of Punjab,"" tweeted the former Chief Minister, who is believed to be closing in on his own decision on his future in the Congress. With the top two Congress faces in the state exiting in this manner, Punjab has become Exhibit A in the party's growing disarray. The Congress's loss could well be Arvind Kejriwal's gain; his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is campaigning aggressively in Punjab and Mr Kejriwal will also visit the state tomorrow. Mr Sidhu's resignation, four months before the Punjab election, calls to question a series of decisions by the leadership. Despite warnings, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had pushed strongly for Mr Sidhu and had even arranged his meeting with Rahul Gandhi when the Congress was trying to decide on what to do about Amarinder Singh.   The Punjab crisis has smacked the party on a day it welcomed on board high profile faces like Kanhaiya Kumar and Jignesh Mevani. Mr Sidhu's move coincides with Amarinder Singh's visit to Delhi today. Though it is described as ""personal"", there is speculation about a possible meeting between the Captain and the BJP. Amarinder Singh resigned as Chief Minister 10 days ago, complaining of repeated ""humiliation"" by the party. Mr Sidhu, who set the stage for his exit, has now himself quit his post, though he says he will ""continue to serve the Congress""."

The chief minister will hold key departments like Vigilance, Personnel, Power, Excise, Mining and Geology, Environment, and Civil Aviation. Besides, he will also hold Investment Promotion, Hospitality, Tourism and Cultural Affairs, General Administration, Justice, Legal and Legislative Affairs, Information and Public Relations.

Gurjit Singh will also hold the horticulture, employment generation and training, and soil and water conservation departments. Another new face - Raj Kumar Verka - will hold the social justice, empowerment and minorities, medical education and research departments.

""The first thing I want to say to the victims and survivors... I am sorry,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference. ""It is my top priority that the perpetrators are not excused but held (to) account,"" he added. The abuses were committed by personnel hired locally as well as members of international teams in the country to fight an Ebola outbreak from 2018 to 2020. The commission interviewed dozens of women who were offered work in exchange for sex, or who were victims of rape. At the same news conference, the WHO's Africa director Matshidiso Moeti said: ""As WHO leadership we apologise to these people, to the women and girls."" The 35-page report paints a grim picture, noting ""the scale of incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse in the response to the 10th Ebola outbreak, all of which contributed to the increased vulnerability of 'alleged victims' who were not provided with the necessary support and assistance required for such degrading experiences"". The special commission cited ""individual negligence that may amount to professional misconduct"" in the report, which Tedros said ""makes for harrowing reading"". It also said it found ""clear structural failures and unpreparedness to manage the risks of incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse"" in the central African country. And the investigators underscored a ""perception of impunity of the institution's staff on the part of alleged victims"". Following media reports in May that WHO management knew of alleged cases in the DR Congo and did not act, 53 countries, including the United States, the 27 member states of the European Union, as well as Britain and Japan, had jointly demanded that the WHO display ""strong and exemplary leadership"" on preventing sexual abuse. A year-long probe conducted last September by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and The New Humanitarian had already documented alleged exploitation and abuse of women by international staff during the 2018-20 Ebola crisis. 'Completely unprepared' The investigation found that more than 50 women had accused Ebola aid workers -- chiefly from the WHO but also from other UN agencies and leading non-governmental organisations -- of sexual exploitation, including propositioning them, forcing them to have sex in exchange for a job or terminating contracts when they refused. To join the gruelling fight to roll back the Ebola epidemic, well-paid aid workers flooded into the poor region. With more than 2,200 recorded deaths, the 10th epidemic is considered the worst to hit the DR Congo since 1976, lasting from August 2018 to June 2020. ""Observations from the review team's interviews with key officials... show that the organisation, focused primarily on eradicating the Ebola epidemic, was completely unprepared to deal with the risks/incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse,"" Thursday's report said. ""It is therefore not surprising that it was totally unprepared for the scale of sexual exploitation and abuse incidents."" The report says WHO leadership was aware of sex abuse allegations a full six weeks earlier than it initially claimed. It quotes an email to the WHO's ethics point man Andreas Mlitzke concerning such allegations in the eastern province of North Kivu. It said the ""message was sufficiently explicit and was in fact the first report of incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse involving WHO staff during the response to the 10th Ebola outbreak"". The WHO ""was aware of these incidents already in early May 2019 and not in mid-June 2019 as argued by Mlitzke,"" it said.

China, the world's second biggest economy, aims to greatly increase investment in research and development by 2025 and its ability to nurture domestic talent by 2030, Xinhua reported, quoting comments made by Xi at a two-day conference in Beijing. Fostering intellectual talent, especially in the sciences, has become a more urgent priority for China as the United States increasingly shuts its doors to Chinese students and scholars studying sensitive topics and restricts the export of technology to, and sharing of ideas with, its strategic rival. ""We must have determination and confidence in nurturing our talent indigenously,"" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying during the two-day gathering on Monday and Tuesday in Beijing dedicated to developing manpower. ""(We must) insist on the correct political inclination, continuously improve the work of intellectuals, inspire talented people to feel a deep patriotism, forge ahead and serve the country...,"" Xi was quoted as saying. Since becoming president in 2013, Xi has reasserted the primacy of the Communist Party in all areas of Chinese life and also adopted a more assertive role on the global stage, clashing with the United States on a range of issues, including trade, Asian security and the human rights situation in China. Washington has long accused Chinese authorities of engaging in intellectual piracy and of stealing American ideas, something Beijing denies. Xi was quoted on Tuesday as saying that China aimed to lead the world in ""strategic sciences"" by 2034. Chinese state media have defined ""strategic sciences"" as areas of research that can boost the country's long-term national interests.

Mr Reddy, the minister for development of north eastern region (DoNER), said the centre is giving a push for development of agriculture in the region to attract investments in the sector and the NE states will play a crucial role to increase the output of edible oils. ""The budgetary allocation for development of northeastern states is around ₹ 68,000 crore in the 2021-22 fiscal compared to about ₹ 60,000 crore in FY21. The Centre has nearly doubled the allocation in the last seven years to the region as ₹ 36,000 crore was given in 2014-15,"" he said, addressing a virtual programme East India Summit organised by CII. Mr Reddy said the NE states will play a crucial role to increase the output of edible oil. It will contribute 50 per cent of the targeted additional area of 6.5 lakh hectares for oil palm cultivation under a centrally sponsored scheme to boost domestic production of edible oils. Under the National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP), it has been proposed to cover an additional area of 6.5 lakh hectare for oil palm till 2025-26 and thereby reach the target of 10 lakh hectares. ""The contribution of the northeastern states will be 50 per cent (in the mission) as the area under oil palm cultivation will go up to 3.4 lakh hectare in the region from the existing 40,000 hectare,"" Mr Reddy said. As a result of bringing in more area under cultivation, the production of crude palm oil is expected to go up to 11.20 lakh tonnes by 2025-26 and up to 28 lakh tonnes by 2029-30, he said. The Centre has been focusing on infrastructure development of the region, including improvement of rail, road and air connectivity, the DoNER minister said. NITI Aayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant said the east and the northeast region covers one fifth of the country's geographical area but its contribution has been far less than one-fifth of the country's GDP. ""The primary reason for the constrained growth of the east and NE region, despite its strategic advantages in terms of location and natural resources, can largely be attributed to insufficient infrastructure,"" he said. To unlock the potential of the entire region, the foremost requirement is to address the concerns of inadequate infrastructure, lack of connectivity and institutional support to improve competitiveness, he said. It is encouraging that in 2019-20 when the entire country witnessed a slowdown due to COVID-19, Mizoram achieved a 13 per cent growth rate, followed by Tripura at 9 per cent, the official of the policy think tank said.

The passenger, identified as Mohammed Shereef, is a resident of Kozhikode in Kerala and was scheduled to fly from Imphal to Delhi on an Air India flight at 2:40 pm. He was taken from the Security Hold Area for questioning but ""could not reply satisfactorily"", authorities said. Officials then took him to the Medical Examination Room for an X-Ray of his lower body, officials said.   The report showed concealed metallic items inside his body cavity, they said. The passenger later confessed, the official statement said. Senior officers of the CISF and Customs were informed and the passenger was handed over to them for further action."

In a communication to chief secretaries of all states and union territories, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla also cautioned against the possibility of COVID-appropriate behaviour not being adhered to strictly during the upcoming festival which may lead to a surge in cases again. Despite a decline in COVID-19 cases, it is critical to enforce guidelines that allow regular festivities in a cautious, safe and COVID-appropriate manner, he asserted. He said the daily COVID-19 cases and the overall number of COVID-19 patients in the country are decreasing steadily but there are still localised spreads of virus in a few states and COVID-19 continues to be a public health challenge in the country. ""Utmost vigil has to be maintained in respect of mass gathering events, so as to avoid any possibility of a surge in COVID-19 cases. ""Consequently, large scale gatherings in fairs, festivals; and religious events and functions may lead to afresh surge in COVID-19 cases in the country,"" the communication said. The home secretary said states and UTs, on a regular basis, should closely monitor case positivity, hospital, ICU beds occupancy of every district falling under their jurisdiction. ""The state governments and UT administrations concerned, having high positivity in their districts, should take proactive containment measures so as to effectively arrest the spike in cases and to contain the spread of transmission,"" he said. Mr Bhalla said it is important to identify warning signs of potential surges early on and to take appropriate measures to curb the spread. ""This would require a localised approach, as has been mentioned in Ministry of Health and Family Welfare advisory dated September 21, 2021,"" he said. The home secretary said there should be a continued focus on the five-fold strategy i.e. Test-Track-Treat-Vaccination and adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour, to safely navigate through the festive season and avoid the possibility of a surge in COVID-19 cases. He said the state governments and UT administrations should continue with their vaccination programme with a focus to accelerate vaccination of eligible age groups and prioritisation of the second dose to eligible beneficiaries. The home secretary urged the chief secretaries to issue directions to the district and all other local authorities concerned to take necessary measures as advised in the union health ministry advisory for prompt and effective management of COVID-19. ""I would also advise that orders issued by the respective state governments and UT administrations or district authorities in this regard should be widely disseminated to the public and to the field functionaries for their proper implementation,"" he said.   The number of fresh coronavirus cases was recorded at below 20,000 (18,795) in India after 201 days on Tuesday, taking the country's COVID-19 tally to 3,36,97,581, while the number of active cases declined to 2,92,206, the lowest in 192 days, according to the Union health ministry. A total of 18,795 fresh COVID-19 cases were registered in a span of 24 hours, while the deaths due to the viral disease climbed to 4,47,373 with 179 more fatalities, the lowest in 193 days, according to the ministry's data updated at 8 AM."

A bench of Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna said its prime focus is the right to life of innocent citizens. ""We have to strike the balance between employment, unemployment and the right to life of the citizen. Under the guise of employment of few we cannot permit others to infringe the right to life of other citizens."" ""Our prime focus is the right to life of innocent citizens. If we find green crackers are there and accepted by the committee of experts we will pass suitable orders,"" the bench said, adding that in our country, the main difficulty is implementation. ""Laws are there but ultimately implementation has to be there. Our order should be implemented in true spirit,"" the bench said. Senior advocate Atmaram Nadkarni, appearing for manufacturers' association of firecrackers, said that Diwali is approaching on November 4 and they want Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) to take a decision on the issue of firecrackers. He said the government should decide the matter as lakhs of people are unemployed in the industry. The senior advocate said contempt must be heard and taken to a logical end but the plight of lakhs of people who are working in the industry should also be looked into. Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan appearing for the petitioner Arjun Gopal, said series of orders have been passed by the top court and directions have been given that PESO will give final clearance to firecrackers which are safe. When Mr Nadkarni interrupted Mr Sankaranarayanan, the bench in a lighter vein said, ""We don't want any bursting of crackers in the courtroom. Everybody will get a chance. Also, I'm afraid of firecrackers."" Mr Sankaranarayanan said, ""My Lord, we assure there'll be no fire in the court, only work."" Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Ministry of Environment and Forests, said an affidavit was filed by the ministry in October 2020 and if the top court takes note of it all the interim applications will be covered in that. All the experts have come together and suggested formulations on the issue of green crackers. Mr Sankaranarayanan submitted that the petition was filed in 2015 dealing with multiple issues of air pollution and a series of orders were passed in subsequent years. He contended that despite several orders, the executive is not taking appropriate action to ban harmful crackers and the consistent sale of fireworks which was prevalent before 2015 is still going on. ""Firecrackers are not narcotics that someone will smoke in the bathroom. This is going on with impunity and the executive has failed to implement orders of this court,"" he submitted. He said the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has been giving certificates to firecracker manufacturers after getting into agreements with them. Mr Sankaranarayanan alleged that Centre has now ignored PESO completely and indirectly attempts to ensure that barium nitrate ban is lifted. The top court remarked that everyday there is a violation of orders and in every religious event, victory processions, marriages we can see flouting of orders and we will have to fix liability on someone, else, this will not stop at all. The court then posted the matter for hearing on Wednesday and asked Mr Sankaranarayanan to submit a separate compilation of orders. The Supreme Court had earlier refused to impose complete ban on sale of firecrackers and said that sale can happen through only licensed traders and that only green crackers can be sold. Online sale of firecrackers has been completely banned.   The verdict had come in response to a plea seeking a ban on manufacturing and sale of firecrackers across the country to curb air pollution.

Meningitis is a dangerous inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. While it is typically caused by bacterial and viral infections, bacterial meningitis kills more people than any other form of the disease. The ""Global Roadmap to Defeat Meningitis by 2030"" was launched by a coalition of partners at a virtual event in Geneva to focus on preventing infections and improving care and diagnosis for those who contract meningitis. ""Wherever it occurs, meningitis can be deadly and debilitating; it strikes quickly, has serious health, economic and social consequences, and causes devastating outbreaks,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The disease is most common in more than 20 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. If left untreated, bacterial meningitis can cause fast-spreading epidemics, killing one out of 10 infected people, while one in five people are left with chronic conditions including seizures, hearing and vision loss, and neurological damage. The WHO-led programme also aims to reduce deaths due to bacterial meningitis by 70% and halve the number of cases overall.

Any majority will rest on the Greens, led by former competitive athlete Annalena Baerbock and novelist Robert Habeck, and the business-friendly Free Democrats, led by former energy trader Christian Lindner, finding areas of agreement. ""Christian Lindner and I are about the same age, and both he and Robert Habeck are men,"" joked Baerbock when asked about the seemingly scant areas of agreement between the two parties. But while her progressive environmentalists and Lindner's libertarians are further from each other than either is from the Social Democrats or the conservatives, their youthful voter bases give them some things in common, especially on social and foreign policy. CLIMATE CHANGE The Greens want to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions within 20 years through ""a massive expansion offensive for renewables"". The FDP wants Germany to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The SPD and conservatives can wait until 2045. The Greens also seek to set a general speed limit on Germany's 'no limits' motorways, an idea the FDP hates, and the two also disagree on whether combustion-powered cars should be banned in the medium term, and on taxing air travel more. HOW TO BALANCE THE BOOKS? The FDP seeks to cut taxes for everyone - a giveaway the IW institute estimates will cost 60 billion euros ($70.3 billion), which would be almost 20% of federal tax revenue. The Greens want to lower the threshold for those paying the top tax rate of 45% and to introduce a 48% band for ultra-high earners. They also want to reform the debt brake to promote public investment. The conservative CDU/CSU bloc wants gradual tax cuts, while the Social Democrats (SPD) want to help those on small and medium incomes and hike taxes for the top 5%. WHAT ABOUT EUROPE? Along with the conservatives, the FDP rejects a ""debt union"" and wants to ensure that joint EU borrowing to finance the 27-nation bloc's coronavirus recovery package remains a one-off. The Greens favour a common European fiscal policy to support investment in the environment, research, infrastructure and education.The SPD regards the recovery package as the basis for building new trust in Europe and has talked about taking steps towards a fiscal union. AND THE WORLD? The Greens and the FDP are more wary of China than the SPD or the conservatives, agreeing that Chinese firms should have no part in the building of Germany's next-generation telecoms networks in order to keep them secure.The Greens say the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Kremlin-backed project that would boost Germany's reliance on Russian gas, should not be allowed to come into operation. The FDP don't go as far, but are more sceptical than the SPD. LONELY STANDS In some areas the Greens are a lonely minority: alone among the four parties that could enter government, they oppose increasing German military spending to NATO's target of 2% of economic output. In other areas, the FDP is on its own. The three other parties would increase the minimum hourly wage to 12 euros ($14). The FDP says this is not a matter for the government. THE ANTI-FAX ALLIANCE Both Greens and FDP are strongly in favour of investment to improve digital infrastructure. The parties share a young voter base that is increasingly exasperated by Germany's fax- and phone-bound public administration.The broad consensus here could be useful when it comes to papering over the parties' sharp differences in fiscal policy. HAPPILY EVER AFTER? The Greens and the FDP would both legalise cannabis sales tomorrow, as would the SPD. They would also allow people to vote from 16 years of age. All three parties would be prepared to allow dual citizenship - a huge change for thousands of ethnic Turks, many of whom remain foreign nationals despite having lived, worked and paid taxes in Germany for decades.The Greens and the FDP would allow civil servants to wear religious headscarves at work. The SPD and conservatives would not.     (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

In her letter of resignation, she said, ""I will continue to work for the party as a worker in the best interest of Punjab."" An urgent cabinet meeting was underway in the state following the resignations, sources said. Mr Sidhu resigned as Punjab Congress chief, delivering a big shock to the Gandhis, who may have hoped that changing Chief Ministers would help end the turmoil in the state before next year's state polls. The cricketer-turned-politician tweeted a resignation letter that hinted at his unhappiness at the ongoing changes to the Punjab cabinet. ""The collapse of a man's character stems from the compromise corner. I can never compromise on Punjab's future and the agenda for the welfare of Punjab,"" he wrote in his letter to Congress President Sonia Gandhi. He had taken charge of the party in Punjab in July.   His resignation came a little over a week after Charanjit Singh Channi, said to be close him, took oath as Punjab's new Chief Minister -- the first ever Dalit to do so. He replaced veteran Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh. Mr Sidhu, according to sources, was upset about the cabinet changes made by Mr Channi. Though Mr Sidhu was widely seen to act as ""Super Chief Minister"" when it came to some decisions, he was reportedly ignored in recent appointments seen as controversial."

A distant relative in the village spotted the post and informed Kuddus that his mother, Mongola Nessa, thought to be in her late 90s, was still alive.

As they searched for prominent local politician Ajmal Omar, who had helped drive the militants out of a Nangarhar district a year earlier and tried to dissuade young Afghans from joining them, Taliban members detonated explosives at his ancestral home. They also looted gold and cars, and detained and whipped several of his relatives to try and establish his whereabouts. The events were recounted by two relatives who say they were targeted in the reprisals, 10 local officials and residents who witnessed or were familiar with the incidents and a former Afghan intelligence official. Images from the sources, which Reuters could not independently verify, show a badly damaged property and family members with injuries they say were from Taliban beatings. Omar, 37, has gone into hiding. He declined to comment for this story, citing security concerns. Soon after the Taliban seized power on August 15, the Islamist movement sought to reassure the international community and its former opponents by saying there would be no reprisals. Omar's family said their experience contradicted that commitment. ""None of us had imagined we would be targeted like this,"" said one of Omar's relatives, requesting anonymity. ""The Taliban said they will not punish anyone who had worked with the previous regime but they did the exact opposite in our case."" Taliban spokespeople did not respond to questions about events described by Omar's family and local residents or about his efforts to help defeat them. A Taliban cabinet minister told Reuters that commanders across the country had raided former government officials' homes and offices to seize weapons and armoured vehicles, but he was not aware of punishment meted out to Omar's family. The group's defence minister, Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, issued a rebuke last week over the conduct of some fighters following the Taliban's victory. He did not go into specifics. ""Miscreants and notorious former soldiers"" had joined Taliban ranks and committed offences ranging from occupying ministries and government offices to two to three incidents of reported killings, he said. ""You all are aware of the general amnesty announced in Afghanistan; no mujahid has the right to take revenge on someone."" SOCIAL MEDIA The Taliban brutally enforced their version of Islamic law during their previous rule from 1996-2001, carrying out public stonings and amputations and banning women from work and girls from school. They have said they would respect people's rights this time around and not go after enemies, yet tens of thousands of people, fearing for their safety and future, fled the country in a chaotic evacuation from Kabul. Many more are in hiding. Hundreds of social media posts have been shared featuring grainy mobile phone footage purportedly of armed men searching houses, beating people in the streets and bundling them into cars. Several former officials, military personnel and others close to the fallen government have alleged retributions took place. Reuters has not been able to verify their accounts; some interviewed by Reuters said they were too afraid to share their experiences publicly. Omar's story is one of the most detailed accounts so far of Taliban revenge against those who worked with the Western-backed government, and in particular who fought to eradicate the group from Afghanistan. ON THE RUN According to residents, the Taliban have long targeted Kodi Khel, a remote village in a valley dotted with apple and lemon orchards in the mountainous east of the country. After they were ousted from power in 2001, the village and the surrounding Sherzad district were struck by rockets as the Taliban tried to wrest back control of the strategic route into Pakistan, the residents said. Omar was a prominent local landowner whose family had a sprawling 22-room walled villa there. As deputy head of the provincial council, he spearheaded strategic efforts to drive the Taliban out of the district last year. Several militants were wounded in the fighting as were some Afghan soldiers. Before then, since his election in 2014, Omar had spent much of his time going from village to village trying to persuade young adults to join US-backed forces fighting the insurgents, according to residents. In a province that has long been a hotbed of Taliban activity, it could be a dangerous job. Three Nangarhar council members have been killed in different attacks in the past five years. Last year, Omar was on his way to a rally to celebrate the Afghan army's local victory when a convoy of cars he was travelling in was attacked by Taliban fighters, killing two people, a former council member said. On August 13, when the Taliban retook Kodi Khel in a lightning offensive across the country, residents said they were ordered to stay indoors as the fighters searched for Omar. Taliban militants found Omar's residence empty apart from some domestic staff who were ordered to leave. Cars and other valuables were taken, and several explosives detonated, collapsing parts of the surrounding wall and turning rooms to rubble, according to interviews with family members and locals who heard the blasts and saw the aftermath. Omar, who was in a crisis meeting of the provincial council in Nangarhar's capital Jalalabad where he and others were discussing how to repel the Taliban's advance, soon learned of the search. He fled to the capital Kabul, then still under control of the previous administration, and remains in hiding, according to two of his relatives. Nangarhar province fell to the Taliban a few days later. On September 3, armed Taliban fighters in army fatigues raided Omar's official residence in Jalalabad, two family members who were present said. They took his three sons, five nephews and a brother into custody, and confiscated gold, cash, cars and an armoured vehicle and some guns he used for protection. The relatives have all since been released. One relative said he and others were beaten with whips and thrown into a room with no window. He shared pictures of injuries showing limbs heavily bandaged and bruised skin.Another relative said he was locked in a room for three days and tortured. Reuters could not independently confirm his account He sees no future for himself and his family in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. Omar's wife, children, four brothers, five sisters and their families all live in Afghanistan and are maintaining a low profile. Omar is currently growing his hair and beard, the relatives said, moving from house to house to try and evade the Taliban and hoping to find a way to leave the country.

The numbers indicated the sharpest fall since the government began collecting such data in 1970. The fall in the non-resident population was because of a decrease in foreign employment, owing to travel restrictions due to COVID-19 and an uncertain economic climate. Both citizen and permanent resident (PR) populations saw year-on-year declines for the first time since the Government began collecting such data in 1970, said the National Population and Talent Division, which publishes the annual Population in Brief report. Specifically, the number of citizens fell by 0.7 per cent to 3.5 million, while permanent resident numbers dropped 6.2 per cent to 490,000, reported the Channel News Asia, citing the data. ""Travel restrictions during the pandemic was the main factor affecting the size of the (citizen) and PR population in 2021, as more (citizens) and PRs were staying overseas continuously for 12 months or more, who therefore were not counted as part of the resident population,"" the National Population and Talent Division said. Fewer people became new citizens or PRs last year, likely due to travel restrictions and operational limitations arising from COVID-19, it said. ""For example, safe management measures resulted in limited slots to complete the final steps for PR and citizenship registration, which must be done in-person,"" it expanded. ""As a result, some applicants who were approved in principle had not completed all the required processes to be granted their permanent residency or citizenship by end-2020."" The non-resident population saw the largest drop of 10.7 per cent, hitting 1.47 million. ""The decrease was seen across all pass types, with the largest drop in work permit holders in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors,"" said the channel report. Singapore's citizen population is also continuing to grow, with the median age rising from 42.2 years in 2020 to 42.5 years this year. The proportion of seniors - aged 65 and above - is rising, and at a faster pace than the last decade, as large cohorts of ""baby boomers"" have begun joining this age group, the report said. Overall, the proportion of seniors has increased from 10.4 per cent in 2011 to 17.6 per cent in 2021.   ""This proportion is expected to increase to about 23.8 per cent in 2030,"" the report said. The number of citizens aged 80 and above has also almost doubled from 71,000 in June 2011 to 128,000 in June this year."

He inducted at the All India Congress Committee headquarters in New Delhi in the presence of party leader Rahul Gandhi. At the event, Gujarat Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani, too, extended his support to the outfit, though he couldn't join the party formally due to technical reasons. ""I am joining the Congress because it's not just a party, it's an idea. It's the country's oldest and most democratic party, and I am emphasising on 'democratic'...Not just me, but many think the country can't survive without Congress,"" Mr Kumar said at a press meet after joining Congress. ""Congress party is like a big ship. If it's saved, I believe many people's aspirations, Mahatma Gandhi's oneness, Bhagat Singh's courage, and BR Ambedkar's idea of equality will be protected, too. This is why I have joined it."" He felt that a particular ideology was trying to ruin India's values, culture, history, and future. He also claimed that ""crores of youngsters"" feel that the country ""can't be saved without saving the Congress"". Mr Kumar was earlier with the Communist Party of India (CPI) which he joined ahead of the 2019 general election. He then contested from his hometown Begusarai in Bihar against the BJP's Giriraj Singh of the BJP but failed to win. Posters welcoming him to the party were put up outside the Congress office hours ahead of his switch. He reportedly met Mr Gandhi twice recently over two weeks. He also met Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. A former president of the JNU Students' Union, Mr Kumar was jailed over alleged ""anti-national slogans"" raised at an event in 2016 to mark the death anniversary of Parliament attack mastermind Afzal Guru. The BJP, however, brushed aside the significance of Kanhaiya's move. Saying that Begusarai had rejected him, Bihar Minister Mangal Pandey told ANI that Mr Kumar was only demonstrating his ""political ambition"". ""Begusarai rejected Kanhiya Kumar's ideology earlier. Now he's changing his ideology and party for political ambition but public doesn't vote for anyone's political ambition. He's going to a party that has been rejected by Bihar and is a sinking boat now,"" Mr Pandey told ANI. Mr Mevani, on the other hand, is a legislator representing Gujarat's Vadgam constituency. He is key to the Congress's poll arithmetic ahead of next year's Assembly election in that state. A lawyer and former journalist, the Dalit leader's expression of support for the Congress comes at a time when the party is reaching out to the community -- it recently replaced Amarinder Singh as Punjab Chief Minister with Charanjit Singh Channi, a member of a Scheduled Caste. ""I could not join the Congress formally due to technical reasons. I am an independent MLA, if I join a party, I may not continue as an MLA...I am part of the Congress ideologically but I will fight the upcoming Gujarat polls from Congress symbol,"" Mr Mewani said. ""To save democracy and the idea of India, I have to be with a party that led the Independence struggle and dragged the British out of the country. This is why I am here with the Congress today."" Welcoming Mr Kumar, Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal said his party was looking forward to working with him and Mr Mevani to defeat ""fascist forces"" ruling this country. ""Kanhaiya Kumar is a symbol of the fight for freedom of expression in this country. He fought against fundamentalism as a student leader. The joining of kind of dynamic personality will fill the entire cadre of Congress with enthusiasm,"" Mr Venugopal said.   The moves by Mr Kumar and Mr Mevani have come at a time when some prominent leaders have left the Congress in recent months. While former Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev joined the Trinamool Congress, former Union Minister Jitin Prasada is now with the BJP. Veteran Goa Congress leader Luizinho Faleiro resigned from the party yesterday."

""As long as real Islamic environment is not provided for all, women will not be allowed to come to universities or work. Islam first,"" Mohammad Ashraf Ghairat said in a tweet on Monday, reported CNN. The new university policy echoes the Taliban's first time in power, in the 1990s, when women were only allowed in public if accompanied by a male relative and would be beaten for disobeying, and were kept from school entirely. According to New York Times, some female staff members, who have worked in relative freedom over the past two decades, pushed back against the new decree, questioning the idea that the Taliban had a monopoly on defining the Islamic faith. ""In this holy place, there was nothing un-Islamic,"" one female lecturer said. ""Presidents, teachers, engineers and even mullahs are trained here and gifted to society,"" she said. ""Kabul University is the home to the nation of Afghanistan."" New York Times reported quoting her. Around 70 teaching staff of the Kabul University, including assistant professors and professors have resigned after the Taliban sacked PhD holder Vice-Chancellor Muhammad Osman Baburi and replaced him with Muhammad Ashraf Ghairat, a BA degree holder. The appointment of Ghairat as VC in the biggest university based in Kabul has led to protests on social media. Critics have highlighted a tweet by Ghairat last year in which he justified the killing of journalists. Earlier, the Taliban has officially changed the name of a government university in the name of Burhanuddin Rabbani-former Afghan President and founder of Afghanistan's second-biggest political party- to Kabul Education University. The university was named after Burhanuddin Rabbani after he was killed in a suicide attack in his home in 2009.   An official directive released by the Ministry of Higher Education stated that universities are the intellectual assets of Afghanistan and should not be named after political or ethnic leaders, reported The Khaama Press News Agency. The directive stated that lingual, regional, and ethnic discrimination have prevailed in Afghanistan in the past two decades and national places were named based on those."

Besides, more than 200 cattle perished and a number of houses were damaged in torrential rains that lashed Marathwada on Sunday and Monday, causing havoc in a region which is considered a perennially drought-plagued area, they said. One person died and three others were missing after a state transport bus got swept away while crossing an inundated bridge in Yavatmal district on Tuesday morning, the officials said. The incident took place around 8 am at Dahagaon bridge in Umarkhed tehsil when the semi-luxury bus of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) was going from Nagpur to Nanded. The bus got swept away for about 50 metres while passing through the bridge, which was flooded following heavy rains in the area, and then overturned, an official said. Heavy rainfall in catchment areas of the Manjara dam forced authorities to open all 18 gates of the reservoir to discharge water on Tuesday, which led to flooding in some villages in Beed district while an alert was sounded in some neighbouring districts, the officials said. The local administration opened all 18 gates of the Manjara dam and 11 gates of the Majalgaon dam, resulting in discharge of 78,397 cusec 80,534 cusec water from them, respectively, they said. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned of heavy rains in parts of the state over the next two days as well. The region in central Maharashtra which faced rain fury comprises eight districts - Aurangabad, Latur, Osmanabad, Parbhani, Nanded, Beed, Jalna and Hingoli. Excessive rainfall (over 65 mm) was recorded in over 180 circles falling under these eight districts, a release issued by the divisional commissioner's office said. The heavy showers forced authorities to open the gates of various dams for water discharge, which led to flooding in villages located on the banks of the Manjara river in Beed and Latur districts. In the last 48 hours, 10 deaths due to heavy rains and floods were reported from six districts of the region - three in Beed, two each in Osmanabad and Parbhani, and one each in Jalna, Nanded and Latur, the release said without providing details of how they died. More than 200 farm animals, including large milch animals, also perished in the heavy rains over the last two days. ""Beed district alone reported the death of 54 major milch animals and 135 small ones. At the (Aurangabad) division level, the figures were 60 and 143 respectively,"" an official from the relief and rehabilitation department told PTI in Mumbai. Besides, 28 houses, including 25 kutcha (thatched) ones, were partially or fully damaged. Among the damaged houses, 11 were located in Aurangabad, 12 in Beed and five in Jalna, an official said. The heavy rain and flood have damaged crops on several acres of agricultural land in the region, the officials said. ""Since yesterday, the Water Resources Department has been monitoring the situation closely. We are trying to minimise the damage,"" Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil told reporters in Beed. The administration will provide all possible relief to people, he said. An NDRF team, a helicopter and boats were deployed on Tuesday to rescue people stranded in barrages, villages and on the banks of a river in Latur district lashed by heavy rains through the day. While 25 out of 40 people stranded on the banks of Manjara river at Sarsa village have been rescued using boats, efforts were on to get the rest 15 to safety, an official said. He added that three people stranded on a river basin in Digol Deshmukh area in Renapur tehsil have been also rescued. Three employees of the state Irrigation Department were stuck in the Ghansargaon village barrage, and a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team as well as a helicopter have been brought in help local personnel with the rescue effort, said District Disaster Management Officer Sakeb Usmani. Officials said six out 10 tehsils and 30 out of 60 revenue mandals in Latur have received heavy rains, leading to flooding of streams and rivulets, resulting in authorities having to release 70,845.30 cusecs (cubic foot per second) of water into Manjara river after opening 18 gates of a dam in Dhanegaon in Keh tehsil. Latur district has received 66.09 millimetres of rainfall in the last 24 hours, with the downpour being particularly severe, along with thunderstorms, in Latur, Udgir, Ahmedpur, Chakur, Jalkoat and Ausa tehsils, leaving many villages disconnected, officials said. Several of these revenue mandals have received over 65 mm of rainfall during this period, they said, adding that total rainfall in Latur district this monsoon has now touched 906 mm, which is almost 109 per cent of the annual average. Heavy rains lashed Mumbai and suburbs on Tuesday, but no major water-logging is reported so far and public transport services, including suburban trains, also remained unaffected, officials said. A civic official said no incident of a major water-logging was reported despite heavy showers in Mumbai. Public transport services are also running normally, he added. ""It''s raining heavily in suburban and ghat sections. But, local and long-distance trains are running as per time table,"" Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway said. The IMD has issued a ""yellow alert"" for Mumbai indicating ""thunderstorm accompanied with lightning, gusty winds, and heavy rainfall at isolated places"" for Wednesday. The district administration in North Maharashtra''s Nashik district has sounded an alert as the level of the Godavari river rose on Tuesday after water was released from the Gangapur Dam.

Fears that climate change is worsening grew after a UN report in August warned the situation was dangerously close to spiralling out of control, with the world certain to face further disruptions for generations to come. ""Thirty years of blah, blah, blah,"" Thunberg told the opening session of a Youth4Climate event on Tuesday. Thousands of young activists have converged on Milan this week with some 400, from about 190 countries, due to engage with policymakers to hammer out proposals for possible solutions. ""So-called leaders have cherry picked young people to meetings like this to pretend they are listening to us, but they are not listening,"" Thunberg said ""There is no planet B...Change is not only possible but necessary, but not if we go on like we have until today."" The youth activists, who fought to get climate change to the top of the global agenda years after leaders at the 1992 Rio Summit in Brazil pledged to tackle environmental problems, are being challenged to help come up with the solutions ahead of the COP26 United Nations summit in November.Their proposals will be vetted by climate and energy ministers gathering at the same venue for their pre-COP26 meeting, and some will find their way to the Glasgow summit.The meetings come as soaring energy prices on world markets stoke fears of a popular backlash against climate reform. The UN COP26 conference aims to secure more ambitious climate action from the nearly 200 countries who signed the 2015 Paris Agreement and agreed to try to limit human-caused global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""Young people need to start getting involved in the actual negotiations,"" said Rose Kobusinge, a youth delegate from Uganda. ""We want 1.5 (degrees) and we won't go beyond that."" 'MONEY SPEAKS' At their pre-COP26 summit, which starts on Thursday, some 50 climate ministers will tackle hurdles, including differing views on the pace of transition and who pays for it. While new energy and funding pledges from the US and China have left negotiators more upbeat, many G20 countries, including major polluters like China and India, are yet to deliver updates of their short-term climate action plans. ""Now is the time for leaders of the biggest economies and the biggest greenhouse gas emitters to make much bolder commitments,"" Britain's COP26 President Alok Sharma, said in a video message on Tuesday. Climate activists are demanding policymakers match rhetoric with action and stump up the billions of dollars needed to wean the world off fossil fuels to cleaner energy during a year that has seen record-breaking heatwaves, floods and fires. ""Money speaks, and if rich nations don't restructure debt for poor nations and commit $500 billion for climate action from 2020-2024, there's no point in wasting time at these meetings,"" Oscar Soria of the US-based activist network Avaaz said. Wealthy nations who pledged a decade ago to mobilise $100 billion a year to help vulnerable countries adapt and transition to cleaner energy are still short of their 2020 goal. ""It was promised by 2020 and we are still waiting,"" Vanessa Nakata, a youth delegate from Uganda, said.

The Taliban's acting justice minister issued a statement saying the Islamists planned to introduce a constitution used during Afghanistan's short-lived golden age of democracy, but only briefly and with amendments. ""The Islamic Emirate will adopt the constitution of the former King Mohammad Zahir Shah's time for a temporary period,"" Mawlavi Abdul Hakim Sharaee said. But anything in the text found to conflict with Sharia law and the principles of the Islamic Emirate would be discarded, he added. Nearly six decades ago, before the world's superpowers intervened in the country, Afghanistan enjoyed a brief period of constitutional monarchy during the reign of King Mohammad Zahir Shah. The king ratified the constitution a year after coming to power in 1963, ushering in nearly a decade of parliamentary democracy before he was overthrown in 1973. The 1964 constitution, which gave women the right to vote for the first time and opened the doors for their increased participation in politics, would appear an awkward fit with the Taliban's hardline views. The group, which swept to power in mid-August, has vowed a softer and more inclusive approach than during their brutal 1996 to 2001 rule, when women were largely excluded from public life, including work and education. But when they presented their caretaker government earlier this month, all the top positions went to hardliners and no women were included. After suffering through the Soviet occupation in the 1980s, followed by civil war and then harsh Taliban rule, Afghanistan once again adopted a constitution in the aftermath of the US-led 2001 invasion. But it opted not to restore the old monarchy, approving instead a fresh text in 2004 that envisaged a presidency and enshrined equal rights for women.

The suggested tweaks will soon be sent for inter-ministerial consultation. Mr Shah was put in charge of the new Ministry of Cooperation formed in July with an aim of providing more heft to the cooperatives movement in the country. The recommendations he has now cleared in a Cabinet note could potentially cause friction between the Centre and states, given that the more than 10 lakh units in the sector fall under the latter's authority in India's federal structure. Among the reforms he has cleared is limiting the number of board of directors to 21. Of these, one director must be from the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe community and at least two must be women. Cooperatives will be able to bring in two co-opted directors with expertise in finance and banking with no real voting powers, sources have said. ""An election authority will be set up to conduct elections which will be headed by an Additional Secretary as its chairman and a Joint Secretary as vice-chairman,"" according to the sources. ""The new rules will have provisions for penalties of between ₹ 25,000 and ₹ 1 lakh in case of any violations by the cooperatives."" The cabinet note being prepared envisages a fund of ₹ 5 crores to be set up for welfare, reconstruction, and rehabilitation. It must be noted here cooperative banks come under the Banking Regulation Act.   The states' reaction to these changes could be telling, especially over measures like setting up a central election authority for elections in cooperatives since these could be seen as an infringement of the states' rights. India's over 10 lakh cooperatives have played a major role in its development."

The 33-minute tape was recorded on January 5, 1970 when the former Beatle spent winter in a remote corner of Jutland in western Denmark with his wife Yoko Ono. Back then four eager boys, writing for their high school newspaper, braved a snowstorm in the hope of interviewing their idol. They clinched the interview. The topics ranged from the couple's peace campaign, the Beatles, Lennon's hair and his frustration with his image as part of the ""Fab Four"". Lennon and Ono were famous for staging lie-ins and singing songs of peace as the Vietnam War raged. ""We went into the living room and saw John and Yoko sitting on the sofa, it was fantastic. We sat down with them and were quite close to each other,"" Karsten Hojen, one of the tape's owners, told AFP. ""I was sitting next to Yoko Ono and John Lennon was sitting next to Yoko and we talked, we had a good time,"" said Hojen, who is now 68. ""He stretched out his legs on the table with his woollen socks. It was just cosy,"" he added. Lennon and his wife arrived in Denmark in December 1969 to sort out the future of Ono's five-year-old daughter Kyoko, who was living with her father in northern Jutland. By then, the Beatles had recorded their last album, Abbey Road, and even though it was not official, the group had parted ways. For a museum or Yoko? Although Lennon and Ono spent their first week in Denmark incognito, the press found out and the singer organised a news conference that coincided with the first day of the school term. Hojen and his friends convinced the headmaster to let them skip class to talk peace and music with the singer, a few months before the Beatles officially disbanded. Hojen and his friends said they decided to part with the audio cassette because they could not imagine sharing it among their numerous children. ""We would be happy if a museum was interested, or why not Yoko Ono herself?"" the cultural consultant said. Labelled with the name ""Skyrum Bjerge"", the hamlet where it was made, the recording is of decent quality. ""You have to sit back and take some time to listen to it and hope for the best,"" said Alexa Bruun Rasmussen, director of branding at Bruun Rasmussen Auction House which is handling the sale. ""They actually play 'Give Peace a Chance', but with different words,"" she said. The recording also includes the unreleased song ""Radio Peace"", and is ""heartfelt"" and ""unique"", Bruun Rasmussen said, adding that the tape and photos could fetch up to 40,000 euros ($46,000). Whoever buys it will not have the right to use it for profit. ""John Lennon is talking to young schoolboys, they share the passion of the peace message. And it comes across clearly that there's a connection between them,"" she said. Although Hojen has recounted that winter day in detail to his children and grandchildren, he will no longer have any trace of it after the sale as the owners have not digitised the recording.

""He is our chief and a good leader... what can I say when I don't know anything?"" he told reporters, adding, ""Sidhu saab para mera poora confidence hai (I have every confidence in Sidhu)."" Charanjit Channi was appointed as Punjab Chief Minister days after Amarinder Singh resigned. The state's first Dalit Sikh leader, Mr Channi was widely seen as being close to Mr Sidhu, with whom Mr Singh has a long-running and bitter public feud. However, sources said Mr Sidhu grew upset about cabinet changes made Mr Channi. The former cricketer was widely seen to act as a ""Super Chief Minister"" when it came to some decisions, but he was reportedly ignored in recent appointments seen as controversial. He was also angry about key posts given to officials linked to the ""sacrilege"" case. Sources said Mr Sidhu was also unhappy about his rival - Sukhjinder Randhawa - being assigned a key ministry. Mr Randhawa was an early candidate for the Chief Minister's post but was later made a Deputy Chief Minister. Mr Channi also said ""he (Navjot Sidhu) is not upset with me"". Navjot Sidhu's resignation is seen as a huge blow, given that the Gandhi family was warned - by Amarinder Singh - about appointing the former cricketer as Punjab Congress chief. At his press conference Mr Channi also declared he would ""lead the people of Punjab to Delhi"" and sit outside Prime Minister Modi's residence to support the farmers' protest. ""I will lead the people of Punjab to Delhi... I will sit outside PM's residence in protest against the farm laws..."" Mr Channi said. The declaration has been seen as significant given opposition parties in Punjab repeatedly criticised the Congress over his predecessor - Amarinder Singh - not doing something similar. Last week Amarinder Singh urged Mr Channi to ensure the state stands with the beleaguered farmers of Punjab ""who have sacrificed their lives in our collective fight for justice"". The Congress in Punjab - where an Assembly election will be held next year - has stressed on its support for farmers in recent days, with Mr Channi's Council of Ministers meeting yesterday to pass a resolution in support of the farmers' 'Bharat Bandh' on Monday. Mr Sidhu also tweeted, declaring the party's state unit stood firmly behind the farmers. The pushback against the laws is widely seen as being driven by agriculturists from Punjab. Amarinder Singh, meanwhile, is now in Delhi. Buzz that he had a meeting lined up with top BJP leaders JP Nadda and Amit Shah triggered wild speculation the disgruntled veteran Congressman was set to switch sides.   Mr Singh's media advisor, Raveen Thukral, later tweeted to dispel such rumours. On Amarinder Singh's Delhi visit, Mr Channi would only say: ""He is our Punjab leader... he would go to Delhi in the interest of Punjab state."""

A five-judge bench of the Calcutta High Court had ordered a CBI investigation into all the alleged cases of heinous crimes in West Bengal after the assembly poll results this year, in which the ruling Trinamool came back to power, after accepting the recommendations of an NHRC panel.   As regards other criminal cases related to post-poll violence, the high court had directed that they be investigated by a Special Investigation Team under the monitoring of the court.

Or maybe it's talk of the trauma among evacuees or the Afghans picking through clothes on folding tables after losing absolutely everything. But there's a sense that life's events, in all of their complexity, are simply unfolding for the over 9,300 Afghan evacuees who have come to call this US military base in New Jersey home over the past month or so -- and who may be here for some time. Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst is one of eight locations in the United States hosting tens of thousands of Afghans who fled aboard US evacuation flights when the United States exited Afghanistan last month. Trying to make them feel welcome, officials here refer to the Afghans as their ""guests"". Signs of the swelling logistical challenges are everywhere. Construction crews push piles of gravel around and are adding to the already vast expanse of white tents housing evacuees. Clothes are draped across chain-link fences, presumably air-drying. Children are everywhere. Perhaps unsurprisingly, unseen challenges are just as daunting, particularly in the area of mental health. ""Everybody here has been through a traumatic experience fleeing Afghanistan,"" said one US military official, briefing US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin outside a women-only dormitory. Mr Austin was visiting on Monday as Liberty Village celebrated a major milestone: Eleven Afghans from two families were the first to leave the base to be resettled inside the United States. It was a small step, and a sign of how much work lies ahead. ""I know this is not easy,"" Mr Austin said, as he thanked US personnel. ""I know we came together... in a very short period of time. But you have done remarkable work."" 'I'D LOVE TO BE A RESIDENT' The Monday visit was the first time reporters were allowed into Liberty Village. The base has a history of aiding evacuees. In 1999, it received more than 4,000 refugees fleeing the war in Kosovo.When Afghans arrive, they are given wristbands with unique identification numbers. Some were lucky enough to get places in dormitories. Others are staying in massive tents with only cloth privacy barriers separating families.The community surrounding the base has donated everything from school supplies to toys and prayer rugs. But the scale of donations initially overwhelmed military personnel. As Liberty Village expanded, it began regular purchases of supplies and encouraged well-wishers to shift to electronic gift cards instead of physical donations for evacuees. Not everyone got the memo. One local resident said in a recent town hall event with her congressman that she pulled into a collection site with donations and saw ""lots and lots of open bags sitting out there in the rain."" ""I now have boxes and boxes of things that I purchased that I would love to give,"" she said. How long Liberty Village will exist is unclear. US government officials have set up makeshift offices to fast-track paperwork for Afghans, shortening a sometimes years-long process to weeks or months to allow their resettlement. But it's clear Liberty Village is bracing for the cold weather ahead, with more evacuees due to arrive from US bases overseas. Afghans here are also settling in. A group of Afghan women set up a beauty salon at Liberty Village that helped get the bride ready for the wedding last weekend. Back in Afghanistan, viral videos circulated showing beauty parlors painting over images of women as the Taliban retook control. During the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule, they barred women from leaving home without a male relative and shuttered schools for girls. As Mr Austin walked around Liberty Village during his Monday visit, he heard from two women who hoped to become doctors in the United States. They beamed with optimism. ""I'd love to be a resident of America,"" one of them said. ""You will be,"" Mr Austin replied.    "

Justice Bharati Dangre also rejected the bail plea of Rajiv Anand, group president and business head of Yes Bank, who is a co-accused in the case. ""...it is apparent that all the applicants are alleged to have indulged in the commission of offenses which have resulted in serious dent to the financial health of the State as well as defrauding (of) the public at large,"" the court said in the order. ""Such offenses are occurring in plenty and have resulted in stultifying the overall growth of the nation and also have caused tremendous impairment to the economy of the nation. These crimes are more heinous in nature as they destroy the economic fabric and financial edifice of the State,"" it added. Such crimes have the tendency to degrade the public's faith in the law and order situation as it is tantamount to a serious blow to its economic and financial condition, the high court added. Bindu Kapoor and her daughters approached the high court last week challenging a special CBI court's order of September 18 refusing them bail. The CBI court had noted that on the face of it, a loss of ₹ 4,000 crore was caused to Yes Bank through the alleged illegal acts. After the three women appeared before the lower court in response to summons, they were remanded in 14-day judicial custody. The CBI court also said they did not deserve any sympathy for being women. It also rejected Rajiv Anand's bail plea and remanded him in judicial custody. Justice Dangre in the order on Tuesday noted that in the cases where offenses are grave, heinous, barbaric, seditious or aimed at damaging the financial health of the state, a court is expected to take these circumstances into consideration while deciding bail applications. ""Arrest can become necessary if the offense is of grave nature and there is likelihood of the offender absconding or fleeing away from justice,"" the high court order said. The bail applications of Bindu Kapoor and her daughter took objection to the CBI court's observation that the accusations on the face of it showed their complicity in receiving loans as a quid-pro-quo for favours shown by Yes Bank to DHFL. They were on bail when the case was being probed and had cooperated with the Central probe agency, the applications said. Justice Dangre, however, refused to accept this argument. The situation during the investigation stage need not continue throughout and in particular when the offense, as per the charge sheet, is a ""grave economic offense"", she said. The Central Bureau of Investigation had said there was nothing wrong with the special court's order denying them bail, and it was merely securing the presence of the accused for the trial. According to the CBI, Rana Kapoor, who is presently in jail in connection with a related case being probed by the Enforcement Directorate, entered into a criminal conspiracy with DHFL's Kapil Wadhawan.   Between April and June 2018, Yes Bank invested ₹ 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of DHFL, and in return, DHFL allegedly paid a kickback of ₹ 900 crore to Rana Kapoor in the form of loans to DoIT Urban Ventures, a firm controlled by Rana Kapoor's wife and daughters, the CBI claimed.

""I told you so... he is not a stable man and not fit for the border state of Punjab,"" tweeted the 79-year-old, whose exit as Chief Minister was ascribed to Navjot Sidhu. Navjot Sidhu's shocker coincided with Amarinder Singh's trip to Delhi and furious speculation that he would meet with BJP leaders Amit Shah and JP Nadda. The Captain, however, told reporters he had come to the city only to vacate the Kapurthala Home for Charanjit Singh Channi, his successor. ""I will go home, collect my belongings, and return to Punjab tomorrow. I won't meet any politician, I am just here to vacate my home,"" he told reporters. Mr Singh's aide had also tweeted a denial. ""Too much being read into Captain Amarinder's visit to Delhi. He's on a personal visit, during which he'll meet some friends and also vacate Kapurthala house for the new Chief Minister. No need for any unnecessary speculation,"" tweeted Raveen Thukral. For the Captain, who resigned on September 18 citing repeated humiliation by the party, vindication came much sooner than he may have expected. Just two days after he quit, the Congress replaced him with Charanjit Singh Channi, who was seen to be close to Navjot Sidhu. After being forced out, Mr Singh gave a flurry of interviews calling Navjot Sidhu a ""drama master"" and ""dangerous for Punjab"". He also criticised Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, calling them ""inexperienced and misguided"" for backing Mr Sidhu.   ""I would not have taken MLAs on a flight to Goa or some place. That is not how I operate. I don't do gimmicks, and the Gandhi siblings know that is not my way... Priyanka and Rahul are like my children... this should not have ended like this. I am hurt,"" he had said. Questioning Mr Sidhu's competence, he had accused him of not clearing a single file as state minister."

The cricketer-turned-politician tweeted a resignation letter that hinted at his unhappiness at the ongoing changes to the Punjab cabinet.    ""The collapse of a man's character stems from the compromise corner. I can never compromise on Punjab's future and the agenda for the welfare of Punjab. Therefore, I hereby resign as the President of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. I will continue to serve the Congress,"" Navjot Sidhu, 57, wrote in his letter to Sonia Gandhi, which he posted on social media. He had taken charge of the party in Punjab in July. Sources say Mr Sidhu was upset about the cabinet changes made by new Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who was seen to be close to him. Though Mr Sidhu was widely seen to act as ""Super Chief Minister"" when it came to some decisions, he was reportedly ignored in recent appointments seen as controversial. He was also angry about key posts given to officials linked to the ""sacrilege"" case. Navjot Sidhu, say sources, was also unhappy about his rival SS Randhawa being assigned a key ministry. The double use of the word ""compromise"" in Mr Sidhu's resignation letter was read as a clue that he was asked to accept some unpleasant choices in the cabinet shuffle. Amarinder Singh, recently replaced as Chief Minister at Navjot Sidhu's instance, did not lose time in posting an ""I-told-you-so"" for the Congress leadership. ""I told you so...he is not a stable man and not fit for the border state of Punjab,"" tweeted the former Chief Minister, who is believed to be closing in on his own decision on his future in the Congress. With the top two Congress faces in the state exiting in this manner, Punjab has become Exhibit A in the party's growing disarray. The Congress's loss could well be Arvind Kejriwal's gain; his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is campaigning aggressively in Punjab and Mr Kejriwal will also visit the state tomorrow. Mr Sidhu's resignation, four months before the Punjab election, calls to question a series of decisions by the leadership. Despite warnings, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had pushed strongly for Mr Sidhu and had even arranged his meeting with Rahul Gandhi when the Congress was trying to decide on what to do about Amarinder Singh.   The Punjab crisis has smacked the party on a day it welcomed on board high profile faces like Kanhaiya Kumar and Jignesh Mevani. Mr Sidhu's move coincides with Amarinder Singh's visit to Delhi today. Though it is described as ""personal"", there is speculation about a possible meeting between the Captain and the BJP. Amarinder Singh resigned as Chief Minister 10 days ago, complaining of repeated ""humiliation"" by the party. Mr Sidhu, who set the stage for his exit, has now himself quit his post, though he says he will ""continue to serve the Congress""."

The statement comes a day after farmers under the aegis of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha or SKM held a Bharat Bandh to demand repeal of the three laws. The SKM is an umbrella body of over 40 farm unions spearheading the agitation. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president urged PM Modi to ""intervene personally, immediately and effectively,"" and invite farmers for talks without preconditions to revoke the three ""Black Acts"" on agri-marketing. Felicitating farmers of the country, especially those from Punjab and Haryana, for the ""complete success"" of the peaceful Bandh, Mr Badal said this should show the government that the people of the entire country stood solidly behind their ''annadata'' (food provider). In a statement, Mr Badal also urged the Prime Minister to convene a special session of Parliament to revoke the three Acts on agricultural marketing that have led the country to this ""impasse"". ""If the government had heeded the SAD advice on the issue when the party not only voted against the Bills in Parliament but even quit the cabinet and broke the SAD-BJP alliance to protest against the three Acts, the situation today would have been different,"" he said. He said, ""As a first step, the government must invite farmer organisations for talks without any precondition and without any further loss of time."" The government and farmer unions have held 11 rounds of talks so far, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers' protest. Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26. The three laws - The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 - were passed by Parliament in September last year.   Farmer groups have alleged that these laws will end the 'mandi' and the MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced and asserted that these steps will help increase farmers' income.

France was plunged into an unprecedented diplomatic crisis with the United States, Australia and Britain earlier this month over a trilateral nuclear security deal which sank a multi-billion dollar French-designed submarine contract with Canberra. That has caused much soul searching in Paris over its traditional alliances. Speaking for the first time on the issue, Macron on Tuesday seized the opportunity to urge for more European autonomy as Washington increasingly reorientates its interests towards China and the Indo-Pacific. ""The Europeans must stop being naive. When we are under pressure from powers, which at times harden (their stance) , we need to react and show that we have the power and capacity to defend ourselves. Not escalating things, but protecting ourselves,"" Macron told a news conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. ""This isn't an alternative to the United States alliance. It's not a substitution, but to take responsibility of the European pillar within NATO and draw the conclusions that we are asked to take care of our own protection."" Under Tuesday's agreement Athens agreed to buy three frigates with an option to buy a fourth for about 3 billion euros, a Greek government source told Reuters. The accord, part of a broader strategic military and defence cooperation pact, comes after Athens had already ordered some 24 Dassault-made Rafale fighter jets this year, making it the first European Union country to buy the fighter jet. ""This will tie us for decades,"" Mitsotakis said. ""This opens the door to the Europe of tomorrow that is strong and autonomous, capable of defending its interests."" When asked whether this deal risked raising tensions in the eastern Mediterranean, Macron said the accord did not target a country specifically, but Greece, as the outer border of the European Union needed to be protected. ""I don't get the feeling that in the summer of 2020 it was Greece that was bellicose in the eastern Mediterranean,"" Macron said, alluding to Turkish actions in the region.   ""As Europeans it is our duty to show solidarity with members states. It is legitimate that we commit to equipping it so it can ensure its territorial integrity is respected and that we commit to cooperating to protect it in case of intrusions, attacks or aggressions,"" he said.

US officials have identified Pakistan as a base of operations or target for numerous armed and non-state terrorist groups, some of which have existed since the 1980s, the independent Congressional Research Service (CRS) said in the report. The report, 'Terrorist and Other Militant Groups in Pakistan', released by the bipartisan research wing of US Congress on the eve of the historic Quad summit hosted by US President Joe Biden at the White House last week, said that these groups operating in Pakistan can be broadly categorised into five types -- globally-oriented, Afghanistan oriented, India- and Kashmir-oriented, domestically oriented, and Sectarian (anti-Shia). The Lashkar-e-Taiba (LET) was formed in the late 1980s in Pakistan and designated as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) in 2001. “LET was responsible for major 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India, as well as numerous other high-profile attacks,” the CRS said. Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) was founded in 2000 by Kashmiri terrorist leader Masood Azhar and was designated as an FTO in 2001. Along with LET, it was responsible for the 2001 attack on the Indian parliament, among other attacks, it said. JEM also has openly declared war on the United States, it noted. Harakat-ul Jihad Islami (HUJI) was formed in 1980 in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet army and was designated as an FTO in 2010. After 1989, it redirected its efforts toward India, although it did supply fighters to the Afghan Taliban. “With an unknown strength, HUJI today operates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India, and seeks annexation of Kashmir into Pakistan,” the report said, adding that HUM was designated as an FTO in 1997 and operates mainly from Pak-Occupied Kashmir and from some Pakistani cities. Finally, Hizb-ul Mujahideen (HM) was formed in 1989— reportedly as the terrorist wing of Pakistan's largest Islamist political party—and designated as an FTO in 2017. It is one of the largest and oldest terrorist groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir. Among other terrorist groups operating from Pakistan are Al Qaeda, CRS said, adding that it has operated primarily from the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas and in the megacity of Karachi, as well as in Afghanistan. It has since 2011 been led by Ayman al-Zawahiri and reportedly maintains supportive ties with many of the groups inside the country. CRS said according to the US State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2019, Pakistan has “continued to serve as a safe haven for certain regionally focused terrorist groups,” and has “allowed groups targeting Afghanistan ... as well as groups targeting India ...to operate from its territory”. Pakistan's neighbours, including Afghanistan and India, and the US have long accused Islamabad of providing safe haven and support to terrorists. The US State Department also noted “modest steps” taken by Pakistan's government to counter terrorism financing and to “restrain” some India-focused terrorist groups following an early 2019 terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir. It assessed, however, that “Islamabad has yet to take decisive actions against India- and Afghanistan-focused terrorists,” and that “progress on the most difficult aspects of its 2015 National Action Plan to counter terrorism remains unfulfilled—specifically its pledge to dismantle all terrorist organisations without delay and discrimination”.   On the topic of “terrorist safe havens,” the Department concluded that Pakistan's government and military “acted inconsistently with respect to terrorist safe havens throughout the country. Authorities did not take sufficient action to stop certain terrorist groups and individuals from openly operating in the country”. Other terrorist groups inside Pakistan are Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent(AQIS), Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP or IS-K); the Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), Jundallah (aka Jaysh al-Adl), Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LEJ)."

This February, the central government had advertised 30 posts at the level of joint secretaries and directors for lateral recruitment.

The young woman's death, like that of 33-year-old Sarah Everard in March this year, has galvanised public opinion over the safety of women in public spaces and drawn promises from the government to do better. Koci Selamaj, who was arrested on Sunday in connection with the killing of Sabina Nessa, was charged on Monday evening, London's Metropolitan Police said. Nessa, 28, was found dead in the Kidbrooke area of southeast London on September 18. She disappeared after walking through a park to meet a friend the previous day. Her death revived debate about women's safety and prompted hundreds of people to attend a vigil in her memory last Friday. Earlier this year, the government faced calls to do more to tackle violence against women and girls after the high-profile killing of Sarah Everard.   A former Metropolitan Police officer has since admitted to Everard's kidnap, rape and murder and is due to be sentenced this week.

Justice Rekha Palli issued notice to Delhi Police and Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) on a petition filed by a woman advocate and said the report be filed within five days. The court listed the matter for further hearing on October 11. The police informed the court that it was taking steps to ensure that the security in district courts is geared up adequately. The advocate said in her plea that she has been practising in various Delhi courts which have become unsafe and an easy terrain for gangsters to settle scores with each other, making courts unsafe for thousands of lawyers. The plea sought direction to Delhi Police and BCD to consider instructing all the police personnel at court entrances to ensure that they check the ID cards of every lawyer who enters the court premises. Jailed gangster Jitendra Gogi and his two assailants posing as lawyers were killed inside the Rohini courtroom on September 24 in a dramatic shootout that also saw the police fire bullets in retaliation, the officials had said.   Video footage of the incident showed policemen and lawyers rushing out in panic as gunshots rang out inside courtroom number 207.

The terrorist surrendered when his associate, trying to cross over with him, was killed by the army. The infiltrators were planning a major strike, the army has said. Ali Babar Patra, the captured terrorist, had claimed that he had to ""drop arms in Baramulla"". But the size of the consignment raised suspicion. Six terrorists tried to cross over, according to the army. They took the same route as the terrorists who attacked the Uri army base in 2016, killing 19 Indian soldiers. Days later, India launched surgical strikes across the border to target terror launch pads. ""The route was from the Sawai Nala Terrorist Camp to Hallan Shumali Launch pad to Jabri, leading into Salamabad Nala. It was along Salamabad Nala through which terrorists infiltrated in 2016 with the help of Pakistan army and carried out suicide attack on Uri Garrison,"" the army said. The terrorists were mainly from Pakistani Punjab. The terrorist caught alive has told the army he was ""misguided and lured into joining LeT due to poverty"" after losing his father early. The army said he had a widowed mother and an adopted sister back in Dipalpur and the family could barely manage. To escape poverty, the teen dropped out of school. He went through three weeks of ""preliminary training"" at the Garhi Habibullah Camp (KPK) in 2019, said the army, and received ""refresher training"" in 2021. Most of the instructors involved in the physical and weapons training of the terrorists were Pakistan Army personnel, the terrorist has reportedly revealed. ""The false and fake narratives of 'Islam being in danger' and perceived killing including the atrocities being committed against the Muslims in Kashmir was the main theme of indoctrination during the training. Possibly, the surrendered Pakistan national was coerced and lured into joining the terrorists' ranks due to his poor financial condition. Apparently, his appeal for surrender, as soon as his mate was killed, highlights that he was not convinced about the Jihad narrative,"" the army says. Ali claimed he was given ₹ 20,000 for his mother's treatment and was promised ₹ 30,000 more on his return from Pattan near Baramulla, where the group was to deliver the war-like cache.   The infiltration bids started on September 18. The terrorists sought to take advantage of the ""dark night, uneven ground, bad weather and thick undergrowth"". Yesterday, two terrorists started crossing but the four others ran back, taking advantage of the thick undergrowth. In the last week, a total of seven terrorists have been neutralised and one terrorist caught, the army says."

The company said it would focus instead on another type of jab it is developing with British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline and which is in the final phase of human trials. Sanofi's mRNA vaccine -- the ground-breaking technology used by rivals Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna -- had positive results in phase one and two of clinical trials, the firm said. But Sanofi said it will not take it into the third and final phase, arguing that it would arrive too late to market with 12 billion Covid doses due to be produced by the end of the year. Instead, the company will use the mRNA technology for vaccines against other pathogens, including the flu. ""The need is not to create new Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, but to equip France and Europe with an arsenal of messenger RNA vaccines for the next pandemic, for new pathologies,"" Sanofi's vice-president for vaccines, Thomas Triomphe, told AFP. ""There is no public health need for another messenger RNA vaccine"" against Covid-19, he added. Results from phase three trials of the other vaccine developed with GlaxoSmithKline are expected before the end of 2021. The firms are combining a Sanofi-developed antigen, which stimulates the production of germ-killing antibodies, with GSK's adjuvant technology, a substance that bolsters the immune response triggered by a vaccine. Fighting flu and malaria Messenger RNA works by providing human cells with the genetic instructions to make a surface protein of the coronavirus, which trains the immune system to recognise the real virus. Sanofi said initial results for the mRNA product showed antibodies were created by 91-100 percent of test participants two weeks after a second injection. No side effects were observed and tolerance of the jab was comparable to other mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. The immune response from the Sanofi mRNA vaccine ""is strong"", Triomphe said. Sanofi had been working since March 2020 with Translate Bio, a US firm specialising in mRNA technology, and had even bought the biotech company for 2.7 billions euros ($3.2 billion) at the start of August. Sanofi has already launched new tests for a seasonal flu vaccine and intends to start clinical trials next year. The results from the Covid mRNA vaccine ""will clearly help inform the path forward for our mRNA development programs,"" said Sanofi's global head of research and development, Jean-Francois Toussaint. ""Today, we have a promising mRNA platform, which we're taking to the next level in development, including moving to modified mRNA, and against other diseases, including flu.""   Germany's BioNTech, which developed its coronavirus mRNA vaccine with US giant Pfizer, announced in July that it aimed to start trialling a malaria vaccine using mRNA technology.

The deal marks ""an audacious first step towards European strategic autonomy"", Macron said at a signing ceremony with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at the Elysee Palace. He called Athens' decision to buy the Belharra ships ""a sign of confidence"" in France's defence industry, against competition notably from the American group Lockheed Martin, according to press reports. The deal also sends a signal from Paris after its stinging loss of a multibillion-euro contract for submarines with Australia, which announced it would instead sign a deal for nuclear-powered subs from the US. Macron has long insisted that Europe needs to develop its own defence capabilities and no longer be so reliant on the United States. ""Today is a historic day for Greece and France. We have decided to upgrade our bilateral defensive cooperation,"" Mitsotakis said. He said the agreement involves ""mutual support"" and ""joint action at all levels,"" though no financial details of the contract were given. Mitsotakis added that the French deal would have not affect a defence cooperation agreement under discussion between Greece and the US, despite the tensions sparked between the EU and Washington after the Australia submarines row. The agreement is ""not antagonistic"" to the Greek-US relationship, he said, citing how ""France stood by us during difficult times in the summer of 2020"", a reference to Turkey's challenge of Greek territorial rights in the Aegean Sea. Macron also vowed that the US-Australia pact would not impact France's strategy for the Indo-Pacific region, where China has made no secret of its desire to exercise significant military sway. ""We have one million fellow citizens who live in this region, and over 8,000 soldiers deployed there,"" Macron said, referring to France's presence through several overseas territories in the region.   He added, however, that ""Europeans must stop being naive"" regarding geopolitical competitions, while confirming that France's ambassador to Washington, called home in the wake of the subs crisis, would return on Wednesday.

Imran Khan during recent interviews to the American media has complained that a ""busy"" President Biden has not bothered to speak to him though Washington was seeking Pakistan's support in stabilising Afghanistan. Replying to a question during the daily briefing on Monday on whether there could be a call from Biden to Khan at some point soon, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, ""I don't have anything to predict at this point in time. If they do a call, we will of course read it out to all of you."" The media, during the briefing, highlighted that as President Biden was meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, Imran Khan took to the stage at the UN and delivered some ""scathing criticism of the US' actions in Afghanistan and he lamented the lack of direct engagement between himself and President Biden. Responding to this, Ms Psaki said that the US has been in touch at very high levels with leaders in Pakistan from the State Department, from the Department of Defence, and from other key components of the Biden administration. ""The President has not spoken with every foreign leader at this point in time; that is absolutely true. But he, of course, has a team — an expert team deployed to do exactly that,"" she said. Ms Psaki said that the US and Pakistan were continuing to ""work together and work on initiatives where we can, make clear where we have concern, but I wouldn't overread into a leader-to-leader call in that particular regard."" ""We have high-level engagement from the State Department, Defence Department, and others at this point."" On Monday, the State Department announced that Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R Sherman will travel to Pakistan next month after her trip to India. Imran Khan, while delivering his UN General Assembly address on Friday, said that Pakistan has been blamed for the turn of events in Afghanistan, by politicians in the United States and some politicians in Europe. ""I want them all to know, the country that suffered the most, apart from Afghanistan, was Pakistan, when we joined the US War on Terror after 9/11,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, in trying to force a military solution is where the US went wrong,"" he said during his address. Imran Khan had in the past expressed his disappointment over the US President's reluctance to talk to him since he came to office in January this year. ""He is a busy man"", Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had said curtly about US President Joe Biden on September 15. Imran Khan admitted that he had not spoken to Biden since the collapse of the Afghan government. When asked why Joe Biden hadn't called him since coming into office in January, Imran Khan curtly said: ""He is a busy man"" and later said Joe Biden should be asked ""why he is too busy to call"". During an interaction with foreign journalists at his residence in August, he had said that he was not really ""waiting"" for a phone call from Joe Biden.

At least 17 provinces and regions -- accounting for 66 percent of the country's gross domestic product -- have announced some form of power cuts in recent months, mainly targeting heavy industrial users, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Nearly 60 percent of the Chinese economy is powered by coal, but supply has been disrupted by the pandemic, put under pressure by tough emissions targets and squeezed by a drop in coal imports amid a trade tiff with Australia. Earlier this month, coal prices hit a record high, with restrictions imposed on businesses and homes amid the supply crunch. Still, China's power demand in the first half of the year exceeded pre-pandemic levels, according to the National Energy Administration. Goldman Sachs said Tuesday it expects growth to come in at 7.8 percent, down from 8.2 percent, citing power cuts that led heavy industries to cut output, leading to ""significant downside pressures"". It is the second bank to downgrade forecasts in as many days. Analysts at Nomura said Monday a surging number of factories had been forced to cease operations due to either government mandates to meet carbon targets or surging prices and coal shortages. It cut its annual GDP growth forecast to 7.7 percent. Apple supplier Unimicron Technology said factories in two regions were told to stop production from midday Sunday through Thursday, in filings with the Taiwan stock exchange on Monday. Dozens of other companies, including a parts supplier to carmaker Tesla, were told to halt production this week, according to stock exchange filings. The northeastern rust belt, with thousands of power-hungry cement kilns and steel smelters, has been among the worst affected. A factory in northeast Liaoning had to rush 23 workers to hospital due to carbon monoxide poisoning after ventilators suddenly stopped working during a blackout, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Footage in local media Beijing News showed cars travelling on a busy highway in the city of Shenyang in complete darkness without traffic lights or street lamps. ""Power cuts eight times a day, four days in a row... I'm speechless,"" wrote one frustrated user from Liaoning. Another complained that malls were shutting early and a convenience store was using candlelight.   ""It's like living in North Korea,"" they wrote.

The new crop varieties were dedicated to the nation through a video conference organised at all ICAR institutes, state and central agricultural universities and Krishi Vighyan Kendra. According to the PM's Office or PMO, 35 crop varieties with special traits like climate resilience and higher nutrient-content have been developed in 2021. These include a drought tolerant variety of chickpea, wilt and sterility mosaic resistant pigeonpea, early maturing variety of soybean, disease resistant varieties of rice and biofortified varieties of wheat, pearl millet, maize and chickpea, quinoa, buckwheat, winged bean and faba bean. These special traits crop varieties also include those that address the anti-nutritional factors found in some crops that adversely affect human and animal health. Speaking on the occasion, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said 86 per cent of farmers in the country are small farmers and the Prime Minister's focus has been on enhancing the income of these farmers. The Prime Minister believes that farmers should not be dependent on compassion of others, but should rise on their own strength. For this, several schemes like PM-KISAN and transport facilities through Kisan rails have been launched to empower them, he said. From seed to market, facilities are being provided to ensure their income doubles and contribute in making India self-reliant in the farm sector, he added. Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel thanked the Prime Minister for inauguration of the newly constructed campus of the National Institute of Biotic Stress Tolerance, Raipur. He said this institute will promote agriculture in the state. ""Climate change is a cause of concern across the world. We are seeing its impact in our area. There are two reasons -- one is natural and the other one is reduction in carbon in soil,"" he said, and stressed on conducting an extensive study to ascertain the impact of climate change in the country.   Union Minister for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Poultry Parshottam Rupala, Ministers of State for Agriculture Kailash Choudhary and Shobha Karandlaje, and former Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh Raman Singh were present in the event.

Posters welcoming Kanhaiya Kumar to the party were put up outside the Congress office in Delhi this morning, hours ahead of the widely reported switch. Kanhaiya Kumar joined the CPI or Communist Party of India just before the 2019 general election and contested from his hometown Begusarai in Bihar against Giriraj Singh of the BJP. But he failed to win the election. A former president of the JNU students' union, Kanhaiya Kumar was jailed over ""anti-national slogans"" raised at an event in 2016 to mark the death anniversary of Parliament attack mastermind Afzal Guru. Jignesh Mevani, a legislator who represents the Vadgam constituency in Gujarat, is key to the Congress's poll arithmetic ahead of elections in the state next year. Mr Mevani, a lawyer and former journalist, joins the Congress at a time the party is reaching out to the scheduled castes community, its traditional support base; the party chose a Dalit Chief Minister in Punjab - Charanjit Singh Channi - to replace Amarinder Singh.   Mr Mevai also tweeted his support: ""The decision of appointing Charanjit singh ji as the CM of Punjab is a message that Rahul Gandhi and Congress have given. It will have tremendous impact amongst not just dalits but all the subaltern masses. For Dalits, the move is not just brilliant but soothing too."" Kanhaiya Kumar, say sources, has already met with Rahul Gandhi twice in two weeks. He has also met Priyanka Gandhi Vadra."

The court added that the bypoll will be held as planned on Thursday. However, the West Bengal chief secretary came in for scathing comments in the order passed by the High Court today for using the term ""constitutional crisis"" in his letter to the Election Commission, asking it to schedule the Bhabanipur poll by a certain date. ""We record our strong reservation about the conduct of the Chief Secretary in writing a letter to the Election Commission stating that there would be 'constitutional crisis' in case by-election to the Bhabanipur Constituency is not held. He is a public servant, who is to discharge his duties in terms of provisions of law, whosoever may be in power. He is not to ensure that any particular person should come in power and in the absence there would be 'constitutional crisis',"" the order said. ""Merely because one person is not elected as of now will not create any constitutional crisis as any other elected member of the Assembly can be sworn in as leader of the party and consequently, the Chief Minister,"" the court said. A PIL had questioned the Election Commission's contention of a ""constitutional exigency"" for holding by-election to Bhabanipur assembly seat in Kolkata. The Election Commission, on its part, had said the petitioner is attempting to mischaracterise the meaning of the term constitutional exigency, underscoring that the same does not mean an attempt to influence voters. West Bengal government had on September 13 submitted before the court that the chief secretary had only written to the Commission requesting that the by-election be held. Bypoll to Bhabanipur seat, earlier represented by Ms Banerjee in 2011 and 2016, was necessitated following the resignation of TMC MLA Sovandeb Chattopadhyay to help party supremo's election to the assembly. Mamata Banerjee will be up against BJP's greenhorn Priyanka Tibrewal, a 41-year-old Calcutta High Court lawyer. Ms Banerjee, who took charge as Chief Minister for the third time after the Trinamool Congress's mega victory in the state election, needs to win the Bhabanipur by-poll as an MLA to retain the top post. The results will be out on October 3. According to the Constitution, a person has to get elected to the legislature within six months of taking oath as a minister. Mamata Banerjee had lost to BJP's Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram in the March-April Assembly polls.   The Bhabanipur bypoll is seen as extremely critical for the BJP, which is heavily invested in defeating Mamata Banerjee after it failed to oust her in the state polls. "

The price of petrol was hiked to ₹ 101.39 a litre in Delhi from ₹ 101.19 and to ₹ 107.47 per litre in Mumbai, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers. Diesel rates went to ₹ 89.57 a litre in Delhi and ₹ 97.21 in Mumbai. Prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes. This is the first price increase in petrol in more than two months and the fourth in case of diesel. The increase followed international oil prices rising for the fifth consecutive day and global benchmark Brent heading for USD 80 per barrel. Tuesday was the first increase in petrol price since state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) on September 24 resumed daily price revisions, ending the pause in rates that had effected since September 5. In four price increases since September 24, diesel rates have gone up by 95 paise per litre. This negates three-fourths of the ₹ 1.25 a litre cut in prices that happened between July 18 and September 5. Before this, diesel price was last increased on July 15. The last increase in petrol rate was on July 17. International crude oil prices have reached a nearly three-year high as global output disruptions have forced energy companies to draw more crude oil out of their stockpiles. Accordingly, US crude oil inventory levels are also nearing a three-year low. ""Global demand for crude oil has been increasing consistently with the easing of pandemic restrictions and improving vaccination rates. On the supply side, OPEC alliance has been slow in easing output restrictions, contributing to the tightened supply in the market,"" a source told news agency Press Trust of India. Additionally, hurricanes Ida and Nicholas have impacted crude oil production in the US Gulf of Mexico region, when they hit in late August and September, respectively. As per both IEA and OPEC, global demand is expected to outpace supply due to which international oil prices will likely remain firm in the near to mid-term. A simultaneous rally in natural gas is also likely to drive demand for alternate fuels. When international oil rates fell in July and August, retail prices of petrol and diesel in the Delhi market were reduced by ₹ 0.65 and ₹ 1.25 per litre. Prior to that, the petrol price was increased by ₹ 11.44 a litre between May 4 and July 17. Diesel rate had gone up by ₹ 9.14 during this period. The price hike during this period pushed petrol prices above the ₹ 100-a-litre mark in more than half of the country, while diesel crossed that level in at least three states.   India is dependent on imports to meet nearly 85 per cent of its oil needs and so benchmarks local fuel rates to international oil prices.

""Merely because one person is not elected as of now will not create any constitutional crisis as any other elected member of the Assembly can be sworn in as leader of the party and consequently, the Chief Minister,"" the court said. A PIL had questioned the Election Commission's contention of a ""constitutional exigency"" for holding by-election to Bhabanipur assembly seat in Kolkata. The Election Commission, on its part, had said the petitioner is attempting to mischaracterise the meaning of the term constitutional exigency, underscoring that the same does not mean an attempt to influence voters. West Bengal government had on September 13 submitted before the court that the chief secretary had only written to the Commission requesting that the by-election be held. Bypoll to Bhabanipur seat, earlier represented by Ms Banerjee in 2011 and 2016, was necessitated following the resignation of TMC MLA Sovandeb Chattopadhyay to help party supremo's election to the assembly. Mamata Banerjee will be up against BJP's greenhorn Priyanka Tibrewal, a 41-year-old Calcutta High Court lawyer. Ms Banerjee, who took charge as Chief Minister for the third time after the Trinamool Congress's mega victory in the state election, needs to win the Bhabanipur by-poll as an MLA to retain the top post. The results will be out on October 3. According to the Constitution, a person has to get elected to the legislature within six months of taking oath as a minister. Mamata Banerjee had lost to BJP's Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram in the March-April Assembly polls.   The Bhabanipur bypoll is seen as extremely critical for the BJP, which is heavily invested in defeating Mamata Banerjee after it failed to oust her in the state polls. "

In an opinion piece published in The Indian Journal of Medical Research, the experts cited a UNESCO report which stated that shutting schools in India for more than 500 days have affected over 320 million children. The piece titled ''Reopening of schools during COVID-19 pandemic: A persistent dilemma'' said evidence indicates that going back to the education system to what it was in pre-Covid times, as early as possible, appears prudent in the Indian context. ""However, it would be necessary to examine the State-specific as well as district-specific data on earlier waves of infection and the status of adult vaccination coverage to project any plausible third wave and its potential intensity to inform such decisions related to schools reopening,"" said the report authored by Tanu Anand, Balram Bhargava and Samiran Panda. The experts spotlighted the already widened learning inequities in India and said there is a lack of scientific agreement on what is the appropriate time to go back to in-person learning among schools. ""There is ample evidence to suggest that children aged 1-17 yr have similar susceptibility to mild form of SARS-CoV-2 infection as in adults. However, the risk of severe disease and mortality in children when compared to adults is much less,"" said the report. Temporary shutting of a class or school may occur depending upon the virus spread in the area or if COVID-19 indicators worsen, said experts. ""It is well known that COVID-19 transmission is an 'over-dispersed' phenomenon. Therefore, testing strategies in school settings could serve as key interventions to check the potential spread of the virus. It must also be acknowledged that the testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools should act as adjunct and not substitute to other organizational and behavioural interventions,"" it cautioned. The experts advocated frequent testing of school staff and students for early detection of cases, which is essential to prevent outbreaks. However, they added that routine temperature or symptom checking in schools should be avoided due to limited evidence on their utility19. School teachers, staff and those involved in the transportation of children should be vaccinated on an urgent basis and continue to use a mask even after receiving the jabs, the experts underlined. The available evidence suggests that children aged 12 year and above are at a high risk of contracting infection and therefore must be prioritized for vaccination compared to the younger children, said experts. Speaking at the United Nations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said  India has developed the world's first DNA vaccine that can be given to everyone above 12 years of age. Zydus Cadila's three-dose COVID-19 DNA vaccine that was cleared by the drug regulator DCGA last month. Consistent use of masks, sanitization and hand washing are the key pillars of Covid-appropriate behaviour and must be practised by students and school staff alike. The experts said while masks are not recommended for children under five years, six to 11-year old children may wear a mask depending on their ability to use them safely and appropriately. Those aged 12 years and above should wear masks under the same conditions as adults, they said. Schools should ensure that the indoors are well ventilated and air conditioners should be avoided. Exhaust fans should be installed in classrooms to curtail the potential spread of infection. Also, children should be advised against sharing meals, spending long hours in canteens or dining halls. Referring to the open-air classes propagated by Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore at Santiniketan, the experts said, ""COVID-19 has forced us to explore and discover innovative learning methods, particularly in nature's lap."" ""Anecdotal evidence from India also points towards a sporadic rise in Covid cases in states that initiated the reopening of schools after the first wave. All these points towards over-dispersed phenomenon in COVID-19 transmission in various settings, they said.   It should also be noted that global evidence suggests schools as ""non-drivers"" of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community, the experts underlined. "

The counting of votes will take place on November 2. The seats where Lok Sabha by-elections will be held are Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Mandi in Himachal Pradesh and Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh. In all three constituencies, the sitting Lok Sabha members had died. The Mandi Lok Sabha seat fell vacant after the death of Ramswaroop Sharma (BJP) at his Delhi residence in March this year. The by-election to the Khandwa parliamentary constituency was necessitated following the death of BJP member Nand Kumar Singh Chauhan. Mohan Delkar, an Independent Lok Sabha member from Dadra and Nagar Haveli, was found dead in a Mumbai hotel in February, necessitating the bypolls. The assembly bypolls will be held in 30 seats spread across 14 states.

""The Commission has reviewed the situation related to pandemic, flood, festivals, cold conditions in certain regions, feedback from concerned States/UT and taken into consideration all facts and circumstances,"" the EC said in a statement while announcing the decision to hold the bypolls. Prohibition of pre and post nomination processions, 50 percent capacity at outdoor venues for campaigning, a maximum of 20 star campaigners for national and state recognised parties and a silence period of 72 hours before the end of polling are some of the COVID-19-related restrictions imposed by the Election Commission for the bypolls. On September 4, the Election Commission had announced bypolls to the Bhabanipur assembly seat in West Bengal and polling for three ""deferred adjourned"" elections in two assembly seats of West Bengal and one seat of Odisha.

TikTok had been ordered by then-U.S. President Donald Trump to separate its U.S. version from Chinese parent ByteDance because of national security concerns about the collection of U.S. users' data. Microsoft in August 2020 began talks on the proposed acquisition but the deal collapsed by September. Trump's divestment push ended by the time he left office in January and no potential suitor ending up acquiring TikTok. Speaking at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills, California, Nadella said he was looking forward to bringing Microsoft's security, child safety and cloud expertise to TikTok. ""It's unbelievable,"" Nadella said of the experience during an on-stage interview. ""I learned so many things about so much and so many people. First of all, TikTok came to us. We didn't go to TikTok."" ""TikTok was caught in between a lot of things happening across two capitals,"" Nadella continued. ""President Trump had a particular point of view of what he was trying to get done there, and then it just dropped off. The [U.S. government] had a particular set of requirements and then it just disappeared."" Nadella said what attracted ByteDance CEO Zhang Yiming to Microsoft was the U.S. company's services related to content moderation and child safety, developed through products included in Xbox video gaming tools and on business social network LinkedIn. ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nadella said he has no idea whether the U.S. is still pushing for a deal under President Joe Biden. The Biden administration has said it is reviewing the national security concerns. ""At this point, I'm happy with what I have,"" Nadella said.

On Friday, Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou flew home to China from Canada after reaching an agreement with U.S. prosecutors to end the bank fraud case against her, a point of tension between China and the United States. Within hours of the news of the deal, the two Canadians who were arrested shortly after Meng was taken into custody were released from Chinese jails and were on their way back to Canada. Beijing had denied that their arrests were linked. When asked if the White House was involved in brokering a ""prisoner swap,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki rejected the premise. The deferred prosecution agreement with Meng was ""an action by the Department of Justice, which is an independent Department of Justice. This is a law enforcement matter,"" she said, adding, ""There is no link."" But Psaki also confirmed that in a call on Sept. 9, two weeks before the announcements, China's leader Xi Jinping brought up Meng's case and U.S. President Joe Biden pressed for the release of the two Canadians, businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig, who had been held in China for more than 1,000 days. ""These two leaders raised the cases of these individuals but there was no negotiation about it,"" Psaki said. Separately, two American siblings prevented from leaving China since 2018 returned to the United States over the weekend, according to a U.S. official. Cynthia and Victor Liu had been subject to an ""exit ban"" despite not facing criminal allegations. Their father, former bank official and fugitive Liu Changming, is wanted in China to face fraud charges. Psaki said she had no information on whether Biden knew about the status of the negotiations between Meng's lawyers and the Justice Department. Meng had been arrested at Vancouver International Airport in Canada on a U.S. warrant, and was indicted on bank and wire fraud charges for allegedly misleading HSBC in 2013 about the telecommunications equipment giant's business dealings in Iran. The years-long extradition drama had been a central source of discord in increasingly rocky ties between Beijing and Washington, with Chinese officials signaling that the case needed to be dropped to help end a diplomatic stalemate. Ball in the US Court Psaki emphasized the deal announced on Friday did not indicate a softening of U.S. concerns about Chinese behavior. ""Our policy has not changed, our policy toward China,"" Psaki said. ""We are not seeking conflict. It is a relationship of competition and we are going to continue to hold the PRC to account for its unfair economic practices, its coercive actions around the world and its human rights abuses,"" she said, using the acronym for the People's Republic of China. Earlier in September, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Biden's climate envoy John Kerry in a virtual meeting that Washington needed to take practical steps to improve relations by responding to a list of demands, which included dropping the case against Meng. ""Right now, the ball is in the United States' court,"" Wang told Kerry, according to a Chinese statement. But U.S. officials have rebutted any suggestion that Kerry or other administration officials had negotiated Meng's release with China for other concessions. Earlier in the week, Xi announced at the United Nations that China would not build new coal-fired power projects abroad, a pledge Kerry had been pressuring Beijing to make to help the world stay on course to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. ""We were not involved in their internal decision-making on it in any way, shape, or form,"" a White House official told Reuters of the Justice Department's process. ""The movement on coal, number one, is, frankly, China acting in its own interest,"" the official said. ""I think they realized that they weren't going to get anything for it. They weren't going to be able to use it as leverage."" Meng arrived to a hero's welcomed in China, and official media there suggested that her release could be a chance to reboot fraught U.S.-China ties. While some Republican senators criticized the Biden administration for giving in to Beijing's demands, analysts said that didn't add up. ""I believe that the deal that the PRC made to get Meng released was on the table during the Trump administration. She had to acknowledge wrongdoing and ultimately that is what she did. I don't see capitulation,"" said Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank.   The Justice Department says it is still preparing for trial against Huawei. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

In the case of minors, the bill says, their parents or guardians must register the marriages. Passed last week in the assembly, this has led to a huge uproar in the state and those fighting against child marriages and girls who had been victims of child marriage say this is a retrograde bill. The question is, by making registration of all marriages compulsory in Rajasthan including the marriage of minors, is the Rajasthan government giving backdoor legitimacy to child marriages in the state? The government says it is following a Supreme Court directive which says all marriages should be registered and it's securing the rights of child widows and even children born of child marriages. But what do girls, who were forced into underage marriages, have to say on this? NDTV spoke to Pooja Jandu in Jodhpur. Pooja was barely 12 when she was married off along with her older siblings in Jodhpur. She was too young to understand what was happening and too scared, she says, to resist in the presence of so many elders. Now 20 years old, Pooja is struggling in court to get her marriage annulled. She wants to be a martial arts expert and live life on her own terms. She says by marrying a child off at a young age, whether you ask her or not, in the eyes of society you make her somebody's bride, a part of another family. ""I was married when I was 12 years old. I tried to say no but the community elders, the 'Panch Patels', pressurised my family. My in-laws wanted to take me away right away to their home but my father resisted saying I was too young. Then too the community leaders tried to pressurise my family saying they will fine us if we don't comply. The government must put a stop to it. If you allow a child marriage to happen, you become a wife whether you like it or not,"" Pooja says. Community panchayats are known to play a regressive role in child marriages, often forcing parents to marry children off early and then levying huge fines on them when they refuse to send underage brides to their marital homes. This was the case of Santa Devi who was married when she was just 11 months old. When she decided to move for the annulment of her marriage in 2015, the caste panchayat in Jodhpur levied a fine of ₹ 16 lakh on her parents and decided to socially boycott them for not honouring the marriage. Girls like Roopa, now 19 years old, have resisted child marriage and won. When Roopa was 15, her parents in her village called Khokhsar in Barmer wanted to get her married with her two older sisters but she mustered the courage to resist, finally convincing her parents to let her study. Today, she works in a hospital and is happily married. She says a ban on child marriages must be an outright one. ""Child marriage must be stopped. How many girls have their lives ruined because of child marriage? There should be an outright ban on it,"" she says. Her husband, 22-year-old Rama Ram, says young boys are as much a victim of child marriage as young girls. He was engaged when he was 12 to a 1-year-old girl. Luckily, the engagement was called off and Rama Ram says he is now happily married to Roopa. She works as an operating theatre technician in a hospital and he is a veterinary compounder. ""Young boys also suffer underage marriages. They can't complete their studies or find a job. They get bogged down with family responsibilities early. So boys are as much victims of child marriage as girls are,"" he says. Activists like Kriti Bhati who have prevented 1,500 child marriages from taking place in Rajasthan and annulled over 43, says the new act, by making it compulsory to register all marriages including those of minors, is a step backwards. ""Women are considered like property and men have a right over their women in our society. By allowing the registration of child marriages, you are further putting a stamp on it. You are also endorsing sexual offences with minors, teenage pregnancy and a host of other problems,"" she says. The government on the other hand thinks that by registering all marriages, they are merely protecting the rights of the children who are part of a social practice that still exists in Rajasthan. The Child Rights Commission Chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal points out that the government is not validating or encouraging child marriages at all. ""If someone is a child bride, and for example, gets widowed, then how does one ensure they get rights in their married home? What about children born out of child marriages? This is to protect the rights of women it's not to encourage child marriage in any way,"" she says. The latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) survey 2015-2016 has shown that the rate of child marriages has come down in Rajasthan from 65 per cent (In 2016 ) to 35 per cent. But activists say that's because a number of child marriages remain out of the government radar.    "

The piece titled ''Reopening of schools during COVID-19 pandemic: A persistent dilemma'' said evidence indicates that going back to the education system to what it was in pre-Covid times, as early as possible, appears prudent in the Indian context. ""However, it would be necessary to examine the State-specific as well as district-specific data on earlier waves of infection and the status of adult vaccination coverage to project any plausible third wave and its potential intensity to inform such decisions related to schools reopening,"" said the report authored by Tanu Anand, Balram Bhargava and Samiran Panda. The experts spotlighted the already widened learning inequities in India and said there is a lack of scientific agreement on what is the appropriate time to go back to in-person learning among schools. ""There is ample evidence to suggest that children aged 1-17 yr have similar susceptibility to mild form of SARS-CoV-2 infection as in adults. However, the risk of severe disease and mortality in children when compared to adults is much less,"" said the report. Temporary shutting of a class or school may occur depending upon the virus spread in the area or if COVID-19 indicators worsen, said experts. ""It is well known that COVID-19 transmission is an 'over-dispersed' phenomenon. Therefore, testing strategies in school settings could serve as key interventions to check the potential spread of the virus. It must also be acknowledged that the testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools should act as adjunct and not substitute to other organizational and behavioural interventions,"" it cautioned. The experts advocated frequent testing of school staff and students for early detection of cases, which is essential to prevent outbreaks. However, they added that routine temperature or symptom checking in schools should be avoided due to limited evidence on their utility19. School teachers, staff and those involved in the transportation of children should be vaccinated on an urgent basis and continue to use a mask even after receiving the jabs, the experts underlined. The available evidence suggests that children aged 12 year and above are at a high risk of contracting infection and therefore must be prioritized for vaccination compared to the younger children, said experts. Speaking at the United Nations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said  India has developed the world's first DNA vaccine that can be given to everyone above 12 years of age. Zydus Cadila's three-dose COVID-19 DNA vaccine that was cleared by the drug regulator DCGA last month. Consistent use of masks, sanitization and hand washing are the key pillars of Covid-appropriate behaviour and must be practised by students and school staff alike. The experts said while masks are not recommended for children under five years, six to 11-year old children may wear a mask depending on their ability to use them safely and appropriately. Those aged 12 years and above should wear masks under the same conditions as adults, they said. Schools should ensure that the indoors are well ventilated and air conditioners should be avoided. Exhaust fans should be installed in classrooms to curtail the potential spread of infection. Also, children should be advised against sharing meals, spending long hours in canteens or dining halls. Referring to the open-air classes propagated by Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore at Santiniketan, the experts said, ""COVID-19 has forced us to explore and discover innovative learning methods, particularly in nature's lap."" ""Anecdotal evidence from India also points towards a sporadic rise in Covid cases in states that initiated the reopening of schools after the first wave. All these points towards over-dispersed phenomenon in COVID-19 transmission in various settings, they said.   It should also be noted that global evidence suggests schools as ""non-drivers"" of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community, the experts underlined. "

This delay is likely to adversely affect Indians', especially students', international travel plans. Without EUA, Covaxin will not be considered an accepted vaccine by most countries around the world. WHO's queries for Bharat Biotech comes despite the Hyderabad-based drug maker asserting that it has submitted all data required for clearance. The indication of a delay comes merely days after the Union Health Ministry hinted that the global body was likely to give its nod anytime soon. ""There is a procedure of submitting the documents for approval. WHO's emergency use authorisation to Covaxin is expected soon,"" Dr Bharati Pravin Pawar, Union Minister of State in the Health Ministry, had said last Friday, according to an ANI report. Earlier, Dr VK Paul, Chairperson of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration, had also said that WHO's approval for Covaxin was likely to come before the end of this month. According to Bharat Biotech, Phase III clinical trials of Covaxin had demonstrated an efficacy rate of 77.8 per cent. Covaxin, along with Covishield, was the vaccine first deployed by India in its massive nationwide inoculation drive against COVID-19 launched in January this year. Others like the Russia-made Sputnik were added to the country's armoury only later.   Covishield is the only India-made vaccine on the WHO list now. It is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India in Pune and was developed by researchers at Oxford University and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca. The WHO has, till now, also approved vaccines manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, and Sinopharm."

Earlier this year, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had announced that he was ""encouraged"" by the fact that India and Pakistan had announced a ceasefire and he hoped for ""further dialogue"". However, recently at the UN General Assembly, India and Pakistan exchanged very strong statements. Pakistan accused India of perpetuating Islamophobia while India pointed out Pakistan has been ""sheltering terrorists"" and working as an ""arsonist disguised as a firefighter"". Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the UN Secretary General, was asked whether the UN was concerned by this exchange between India and Pakistan, especially with respect to peace in the region, and if the UN Secretary-General was planning to speak to the leaders of either of the two neighbouring countries. ""We heard the remarks and I think despite the tone and content of the remarks we always remain hopeful that dialogue can happen maybe in a place that is not under the spotlight,"" Mr Dujarric told NDTV. On Friday, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in a pre-recorded video address at the UN General Assembly accused India of a ""reign of terror"" on Muslims.   While India often ignores Pakistan's false statements at the UN, this time it exercised its right to respond to Mr Khan. Sneha Dubey, First Secretary at India's UN mission, said Pakistan had been ""sheltering and glorifying al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden"" who was killed by US special forces in a 2011 raid in the army city of Abbottabad. ""We keep hearing that Pakistan is a 'victim of terrorism'. This is the country which is an arsonist disguising itself as a firefighter. Pakistan nurtures terrorists in their backyard in the hope that they will only harm their neighbours. Our region, and in fact the entire world, has suffered because of their policies. On the other hand, they are trying to cover up sectarian violence in their country as acts of terror,"" Ms Dubey said."

The only one among the seven to get cabinet rank, Jitin Prasada denied that a UP ministry was a comedown for him. The 47-year-old was once a Union Minister in the Congress-led government. ""It is not about promotion or demotion, it's about the intent to serve the people and whatever opportunity and responsibility I have got I am thankful to the BJP leadership, especially to the PM (Narendra Modi), Home Minister Amit Shah, JP Nadda and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath,"" Mr Prasada told NDTV. All new ministers met with the Chief Minister earlier today. They still have not been assigned ministries and have just three months before the code of conduct kicks in, which means no new announcement. ""Time is not that much important - it is the intent and the direction to work that is important. We will be working on the progress of the state and the people and that is the way forward,"" Mr Prasada said, asked what he could hope to achieve in such a short time. Mr Prasada, once close to Rahul Gandhi and the Congress's top Brahmin face in UP, quit the party in June. He was Minister of State in Manmohan Singh's government.   According to sources close to him, he had felt side-lined in the Congress for some time. For the BJP, Mr Prasada is a significant acquisition as it tries to consolidate the support of Brahmin voters, seen to have turned away from the party in recent years."

Panchjanya editor Hitesh Shankar on Monday tweeted an image of the new cover, which features Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and the headline ""#Amazon: East India Company 2.0"". The cover refers to allegations Amazon's legal representatives bribed Indian officials, and asks: ""What did it (the company) do wrong it needed to bribe... Why do people consider this company a threat to indigenous entrepreneurship, economic freedom and culture?"" Amazon has not yet responded to the tweet or the magazine's cover story. The article has, however, been backed by the Confederation of All India Traders, or CAIT, which said it ""greatly appreciated"" the cover story and that it ""corroborated"" the group's claims that Amazon and Flipkart are ""trying to become second edition of East India Company in India"". ""... is a matter of fact that business model of these two companies are similar (to) that of East India Company - selling goods at cheaper rate irrespective of the quality... killing competition... and monopolising the market in their favour..."" BC Bhartia, CAIT National President, said. ""This is exactly what East India Company did... both Amazon and Flipkart want to invade our country's econom(ic) and social culture..."" the CAIT chief declared. Last week the government said that bribery charges involving Amazon - specifically questions raised over the payment of an estimated ₹ 8,500 crore in legal fees - would be fully investigated. ""... it is time to think where all it is going... whole system seems to work on bribes and that is not the best of business practices,"" unnamed Indian government officials were quoted as saying. The US-headquartered company has also launched an internal inquiry into claims that surfaced after a whistleblower flagged alleged bribe payments. The company's senior corporate counsel has reportedly been sent on leave. It is unclear when and in which state the alleged acts of bribery took place. Both sides have stressed ""zero tolerance towards corruption"". Earlier in September, Panchjanya lashed out Infosys - an information technology behemoth widely seen as one of India's biggest success stories in the global business community. The article attacked Infosys over the repeated glitches that have marked the rollout of the new income tax e-filing portal; the company was accused an ""anti national conspiracy"". The attack - in a magazine considered close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government - also led an executive working at a global consultancy to tell news agency Reuters ""everyone is scared"". Congress leader Jairam Ramesh called the article and its content ""absolutely condemnable"", and said that it was, in fact, the magazine that was ""anti national"" for attacking Infosys. The Panchjanya article on Infosys came a month after Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal took a swipe at the $106 billion Tata Group's objections to proposed policy changes for e-commerce. ""The frontal attack on iconic elements of Indian businesses have only buttressed the need for companies to ensure they are conforming, not just with tax issues, but with other government initiatives,"" Dilip Cherian, co-founder of a leading PR firm, told Reuters. The government moved to distance itself from the Panchjanya article criticising Infosys; Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman called it ""not right"".   The RSS also distanced itself from that article; spokesperson Sunil Ambekar said the magazine ""is not a mouthpiece... and article or opinions in it should not be linked with the RSS.""

Luizinho Faleiro also said the Congress ""is not the same party for which we had sacrificed and fought"". The 70-year-old is widely expected to join the Trinamool Congress and all but announced it as he showered praise on Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. ""Mamata Banerjee has given a tough fight to Narendra Modi. The Mamata formula has won in Bengal,"" Luizinho Faleiro told reporters, asked to confirm that his party switch. Mr Faleiro asserted that he would continue to be a ""Congressman of the larger Congress family"", implying that he saw the Trinamool as the Congress offshoot best equipped to fight the BJP. ""Among all four Congresses, it is Mamata who has given a tough fight to (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi and their juggernaut,"" said the former Chief Minister. In his resignation letter, Mr Faleiro was considerably sullen and dejected as he recalled the Congress's depletion in Goa from the point in 2017 when power was within the party's reach. He blamed the interference of the ""AICC (All India Congress Committee) in-charge of Goa"" for the Congress not forming a government at the time, without naming Digvijaya Singh. ""Till now, (no one is) being held accountable for the loss of 13 of our MLAs~CHECK~ I see absolutely no hope or even the will to prevent the collapse of the party and change for the better,"" wrote the veteran. ""The Congress in Goa is not the same party for which we had sacrificed and fought. It is functioning contrary to every ideal and principle of its founding fathers~CHECK~, ""said Mr Faleiro, referring to Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. The Goa unit of Congress had become a ""cruel parody"" of what the party stands for, he said. ""Led by a coterie of leaders who prioritise personal gain over the responsibility we owe to our people, we have utterly failed to be an effective opposition."" Mr Faleiro's exit underlines the Congress's rapid decline in Goa. Two years ago, 10 of its 15 MLAs quit and joined the BJP. Parties like the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Trinamool Congress seek to fill the vacuum. Earlier today, Mr Faleiro said Mamata Banerjee is the only ""streetfighter"" who can give the BJP a tough fight. This will be the second prominent defection to the Trinamool after Sushmita Deb's crossover. While Ms Deb has been given a big role in Tripura ahead of elections next year, Mr Faleiro is likely to bolster the Trinamool in Goa. His experience in the north-east, especially in Tripura makes him a valuable acquisition for the Trinamool.   Mr Faleiro was the Congress's in-charge of Tripura for the 2019 national election and could also help the Trinamool in the northeastern state where it is looking to expand its footprint and take on the ruling BJP. Goa is due to vote next year, along with Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, and other states."

The brutality has been reported by Panjshir Observer which is an independent media covering Panjshir and Afghanistan situation. ""Child executed in Takhar province by Taliban fighters after his father is suspected of being in the Resistance. #WarCrimes #Afghanistan,"" Panjshir Observer said in a tweet. The incident reflects the Taliban's crackdown on Afghans who raised voices against the outfit. The Taliban after the siege of Afghanistan is trying to deliver a moderate image to the world in an attempt to gain international confidence but experts say that the scenes at the Kabul airport were proof that the terrorist group has returned with the same radical and violent mindset. Violence was an integral trait of the Taliban even in their previous term. The so-called transfer of power exercised in Kabul without any bloodshed, was nothing but a part of ''good image plan'', Inside Over reported.   As the Taliban took control of Afghanistan once again after 20 years, experts also believe that Afghan women are most likely to face an uncertain future under the terrorist group regime.
